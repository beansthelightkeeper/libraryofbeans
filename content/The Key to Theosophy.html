<p class="f150"><b>PREFACE</b></p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of this book is exactly expressed in its title,
“<span class="smcap">The Key to Theosophy</span>,” and needs but few words of
explanation. It is not a complete or exhaustive text-book of Theosophy, but
only a key to unlock the door that leads to the deeper study. It traces the
broad outlines of the Wisdom Religion, and explains its fundamental
principles; meeting, at the same time, the various objections raised by
the average Western enquirer, and endeavouring to present unfamiliar
concepts in a form as simple and in language as clear as possible.
That it should succeed in making Theosophy intelligible without mental
effort on the part of the reader, would be too much to expect; but it
is hoped that the obscurity still left is of the thought not of the
language, is due to depth not to confusion. To the mentally lazy or
obtuse, Theosophy must remain a riddle; for in the world mental as in
the world spiritual each man must progress by his own efforts. The
writer cannot do the reader’s thinking for him, nor would the latter
be any the better off if such vicarious thought were possible. The
need for such an exposition as the present has long been felt among
those interested in the Theosophical Society and its work, and it
is hoped that it will supply information, as free as possible from
technicalities, to many whose attention has been awakened, but who, as
yet, are merely puzzled and not convinced.</p>
<p class="indent">Some care has been taken in disentangling some part
of what is true from what is false in Spiritualistic teachings as to
the post-mortem life, and to showing the true nature of Spiritualistic
phænomena. Previous explanations of a similar kind have drawn much
wrath upon the writer’s devoted head; the Spiritualists, like too many
others, preferring to believe what is pleasant rather than what is
true, and becoming very angry with anyone who destroys an agreeable
delusion. For the past year Theosophy has been the target for every
poisoned arrow of Spiritualism, as though the possessors of a half
truth felt more antagonism to the possessors of the whole truth than
those who had no share to boast of.</p>
<p class="indent">Very hearty thanks are due from the author to many
Theosophists who have sent suggestions and questions, or have otherwise
contributed help during the writing of this book. The work will be the
more useful for their aid, and that will be their best reward.</p>

<hr class="r5">
<h3>THE MEANING OF THE NAME.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enquirer.</span> Theosophy and its doctrines
are often referred to as a new-fangled religion. Is it a religion?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theosophist.</span> It is not.
Theosophy is Divine Knowledge or Science.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is the real meaning of the term?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> “Divine Wisdom,”
<b>Θεοσοφία</b> (Theosophia) or Wisdom of the gods, as <b>Θεογονία</b> (theogonia),
genealogy of the gods. The word <b>Θεὸς</b> means a god in Greek, one of the
divine beings, certainly not “God” in the sense attached in our day to
the term. Therefore, it is not “Wisdom of God,” as translated by some,
but <i>Divine Wisdom</i> such as that possessed by the gods. The term is
many thousand years old.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is the origin of the name?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It comes
to us from the Alexandrian philosophers, called lovers of truth,
Philatheians, from <b>φιλ</b> (phil) “loving,” and <b>ἀλήθεια</b> (aletheia) “truth.”
The name Theosophy dates from the third century of our era, and began
with Ammonius Saccas and his disciples,<a id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1_1">[1]</a>
who started the Eclectic Theosophical system.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What was the object of this system?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> First of all
to inculcate certain great moral truths upon its disciples, and all
those who were “lovers of the truth.” Hence the motto adopted by the
Theosophical Society: “There is no religion higher than
truth.”<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2_2">[2]</a>
The chief aim of the Founders of the Eclectic Theosophical School was
one of the three objects of its modern successor, the Theosophical
Society, namely, to reconcile all religions, sects and nations under a
common system of ethics, based on eternal verities.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p> <span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What have you to show that this is
not an impossible dream; and that all the world’s religions <i>are</i> based
on the one and the same truth?

<span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Their comparative study and analysis.
The “Wisdom-Religion” was one in antiquity; and the sameness of
primitive religious philosophy is proven to us by the identical
doctrines taught to the Initiates during the MYSTERIES, an institution
once universally diffused. “All the old worships indicate the existence
of a single Theosophy anterior to them. The key that is to open
one must open all; otherwise it cannot be the right key.”
(Eclect. Philo.)</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_1_2"></a>THE POLICY OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> In the days of Ammonius there were several ancient
great religions, and numerous were the sects in Egypt and
Palestine alone. How could he reconcile them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> By doing that which we again try to do now.
The Neo-Platonists were a large body, and belonged to various
religious philosophies<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3_3">[3]</a>;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
so do our Theosophists. In those days, the Jew Aristobulus affirmed
that the ethics of Aristotle represented the <i>esoteric</i> teachings
of the Law of Moses; Philo Judæus endeavoured to reconcile the
<i>Pentateuch</i> with the Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy; and
Josephus proved that the Essenes of Carmel were simply the copyists
and followers of the Egyptian Therapeutæ (the healers). So it is in
our day. We can show the line of descent of every Christian religion,
as of every, even the smallest, sect. The latter are the minor twigs
or shoots grown on the larger branches; but shoots and branches spring
from the same trunk—the WISDOM-RELIGION. To prove this was the aim of
Ammonius, who endeavoured to induce Gentiles and Christians, Jews and
Idolators, to lay aside their contentions and strifes, remembering
only that they were all in possession of the same truth under various
vestments, and were all the children of a common
mother.<a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4_4">[4]</a>
This is the aim of Theosophy likewise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are your authorities for saying this of the
ancient Theosophists of Alexandria?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> An almost countless number of well-known writers.
Mosheim, one of them, says that:—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“Ammonius taught that the religion of the
multitude went hand-in-hand with philosophy, and with her had shared
the fate of being by degrees corrupted and obscured with mere human
conceits, superstitions, and lies; that it ought, therefore, to be
brought back to its original purity by purging it of this dross
and expounding it upon philosophical principles; and the whole
Christ had in view was to reinstate and restore to its primitive
integrity the wisdom of the ancients; to reduce within bounds the
universally-prevailing dominion of superstition; and in part to
correct, and in part to exterminate the various errors that had found
their way into the different popular religions.”</p>
<p class="no-indent">This, again, is precisely what the modern Theosophists say.
Only while the great Philaletheian was supported and helped
in the policy he pursued by two Church Fathers, Clement and
Athenagoras, by all the learned Rabbis of the Synagogue, the
Academy and the Groves, and while he taught a common doctrine
for all, we, his followers on the same line, receive no
recognition, but, on the contrary, are abused and persecuted.
People 1,500 years ago are thus shown to have been more tolerant
than they are in this <i>enlightened</i> century.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Was he encouraged and supported
by the Church because, notwithstanding his heresies, Ammonius taught
Christianity and was a Christian?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all. He was born a Christian, but
never accepted Church Christianity. As said of him by the same writer:</p>
<p class="blockquot">“He had but to propound his instructions according
to the ancient pillars of Hermes, which Plato and Pythagoras knew
before, and from them constituted their philosophy. Finding the same
in the prologue of the Gospel according to St. John, he very properly
supposed that the purpose of Jesus was to restore the great doctrine of
wisdom in its primitive integrity. The narratives of the Bible and the
stories of the gods he considered to be allegories illustrative of the
truth, or else fables to be rejected.” Moreover, as says the <i>Edinburgh
Encyclopedia</i>, “he acknowledged that Jesus Christ was an excellent
<i>man</i> and the ‘friend of God,’ but alleged that it was not his design
entirely to abolish the worship of demons (gods), and that his only
intention was to purify the ancient religion.”</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_1_3"></a>THE WISDOM-RELIGION ESOTERIC IN ALL AGES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Since Ammonius never committed anything to writing,
how can one feel sure that such were his teachings?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Neither did Buddha, Pythagoras, Confucius, Orpheus,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Socrates, or even Jesus, leave behind them any writings. Yet most
of these are historical personages, and their teachings have all
survived. The disciples of Ammonius (among whom Origen and Herennius)
wrote treatises and explained his ethics. Certainly the latter are as
historical, if not more so, than the Apostolic writings. Moreover,
his pupils—Origen, Plotinus, and Longinus (counsellor of the famous
Queen Zenobia)—have all left voluminous records of the Philaletheian
System—so far, at all events, as their public profession of faith
was known, for the school was divided into exoteric and <i>esoteric</i>
teachings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How have the latter tenets
reached our day, since you hold that what is properly called the
WISDOM-RELIGION was esoteric?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The WISDOM-RELIGION was ever one,
and being the last word of possible human knowledge, was, therefore,
carefully preserved. It preceded by long ages the Alexandrian
Theosophists, reached the modern, and will survive every other religion
and philosophy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Where and by whom was it so preserved?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Among Initiates of every country;
among profound seekers after truth—their disciples; and in those
parts of the world where such topics have always been most valued and
pursued: in India, Central Asia, and Persia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you give me some proofs of its
esotericism?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The best proof you can have of
the fact is that every ancient religious, or rather philosophical,
cult consisted of an esoteric or secret teaching, and an exoteric
(outward public) worship. Furthermore, it is a well-known fact that the
MYSTERIES of the ancients comprised with every nation the “greater”
(secret) and “Lesser” (public) MYSTERIES—<i>e.g.</i>, in the celebrated
solemnities called the <i>Eleusinia</i>, in Greece. From the Hierophants of
Samothrace, Egypt, and the initiated Brahmins of the India of old, down
to the later Hebrew Rabbis, all preserved, for fear of profanation, their real
<i>bona fide</i> beliefs secret. The Jewish Rabbis called their secular religious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
series the <i>Mercavah</i> (the exterior body), “the vehicle,” or, <i>the
covering which contains the hidden soul</i>—<i>i.e.</i>, their highest secret
knowledge. Not one of the ancient nations ever imparted through its
priests its real philosophical secrets to the masses, but allotted to
the latter only the husks. Northern Buddhism has its “greater” and
its “lesser” vehicle, known as the <i>Mahayana</i>, the esoteric, and the
<i>Hinayana</i>, the exoteric, Schools. Nor can you blame them for such
secrecy; for surely you would not think of feeding your flock of sheep
on learned dissertations on botany instead of on grass? Pythagoras
called his <i>Gnosis</i> “the knowledge of things that are,” or ἡ γνῶσις τῶν
ὄντων, and preserved that knowledge for his pledged disciples only:
for those who could digest such mental food and feel satisfied; and
he pledged them to silence and secrecy. Occult alphabets and secret
ciphers are the development of the old Egyptian <i>hieratic</i> writings,
the secret of which was, in the days of old, in the possession only
of the Hierogrammatists, or initiated Egyptian priests. Ammonius
Saccas, as his biographers tell us, bound his pupils by oath not to
divulge <i>his higher doctrines</i> except to those who had already been
instructed in preliminary knowledge, and who were also bound by a
pledge. Finally, do we not find the same even in early Christianity,
among the Gnostics, and even in the teachings of Christ? Did he not
speak to the multitudes in parables which had a two-fold meaning, and
explain his reasons only to his disciples? “To you,” he says, “it is
given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven; but unto them
that are without, all these things are done in parables” (Mark iv. 11).
“The Essenes of Judea and Carmel made similar distinctions, dividing
their adherents into neophytes, brethren, and the <i>perfect</i>, or those
initiated” (Eclec. Phil.). Examples might be brought from every country
to this effect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you attain the “Secret Wisdom”
simply by study? Encyclopædias define <i>Theosophy</i> pretty much as
Webster’s Dictionary does, <i>i.e.</i>, as “<i>supposed intercourse with God
and superior spirits, and consequent attainment of superhuman
knowledge by physical means and chemical processes</i>.” Is this so?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I think not. Nor is there any
lexicographer capable of explaining, whether to himself or others,
how <i>superhuman</i> knowledge can be attained by <i>physical</i> or chemical
processes. Had Webster said “by <i>metaphysical</i> and alchemical
processes,” the definition would be approximately correct: as it is,
it is absurd. Ancient Theosophists claimed, and so do the modern, that
the infinite cannot be known by the finite—<i>i.e.</i>, sensed by the finite
Self—but that the divine essence could be communicated to the higher
Spiritual Self in a state of ecstacy. This condition can hardly be
attained, like <i>hypnotism</i>, by “physical and chemical means.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is your explanation of it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Real ecstacy was defined by
Plotinus as “the liberation of the mind from its finite consciousness,
becoming one and identified with the infinite.” This is the highest
condition, says Prof. Wilder, but not one of permanent duration, and
it is reached only by the very <i>very</i> few. It is, indeed, identical
with that state which is known in India as <i>Samadhi</i>. The latter is
practised by the Yogis, who facilitate it physically by the greatest
abstinence in food and drink, and mentally by an incessant endeavour
to purify and elevate the mind. Meditation is silent and <i>unuttered</i>
prayer, or, as Plato expressed it, “the ardent turning of the soul
toward the divine; not to ask any particular good (as in the common
meaning of prayer), but for good itself—for the universal Supreme Good”
of which we are a part on earth, and out of the essence of which we
have all emerged. Therefore, adds Plato, “remain silent in the presence
of the <i>divine ones</i>, till they remove the clouds from thy eyes and
enable thee to see by the light which issues from themselves, not what
appears as good to thee, but what is intrinsically
good.”<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5_5">[5]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Theosophy, then, is not, as held by
some, a newly devised scheme?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Only ignorant people can thus refer
to it. It is as old as the world, in its teachings and ethics, if not
in name, as it is also the broadest and most catholic system among
all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How comes it, then, that Theosophy
has remained so unknown to the nations of the Western Hemisphere?
Why should it have been a sealed book to races confessedly the most
cultured and advanced?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We believe there were nations as
cultured in days of old and certainly more spiritually “advanced” than
we are. But there are several reasons for this willing ignorance. One
of them was given by St. Paul to the cultured Athenians—a loss, for
long centuries, of real spiritual insight, and even interest, owing to
their too great devotion to things of sense and their long slavery to
the dead letter of dogma and ritualism. But the strongest reason for
its lies in the fact that real Theosophy has ever been kept secret.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You have brought forward proofs that
such secrecy has existed; but what was the real cause for it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The causes for it were: <i>Firstly</i>,
the perversity of average human nature and its selfishness, always
tending to the gratification of <i>personal</i> desires to the detriment of
neighbours and next of kin. Such people could never be entrusted with
<i>divine</i> secrets. <i>Secondly</i>, their unreliability to keep the sacred
and divine knowledge from desecration. It is the latter that led to the
perversion of the most sublime truths and symbols, and to the gradual
transformation of things spiritual into anthropomorphic, concrete, and
gross imagery—in other words, to the dwarfing of the god-idea and to idolatry.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_1_4"></a>THEOSOPHY IS NOT BUDDHISM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You are often spoken of as “Esoteric
Buddhists.” Are you then all followers of Gautama Buddha?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No more than musicians are all
followers of Wagner. Some of us are Buddhists by religion; yet there
are far more Hindus and Brahmins than Buddhists among us, and more
Christian-born Europeans and Americans than <i>converted</i> Buddhists.
The mistake has arisen from a misunderstanding of the real meaning of
the title of Mr. Sinnett’s excellent work, “Esoteric Buddhism,” which
last word ought to have been spelt <i>with one, instead of two, d’s</i>,
as then <i>Budhism</i> would have meant what it was intended for, merely
“Wisdom<i>ism</i>” (Bodha, bodhi, “intelligence,” “wisdom”) instead of
<i>Buddhism</i>, Gautama’s religious philosophy. Theosophy, as already said,
is the WISDOM-RELIGION.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is the difference between
Buddhism, the religion founded by the Prince of Kapilavastu,
and <i>Budhism</i>, the “Wisdomism” which you say is synonymous with
Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just the same difference as
there is between the secret teachings of Christ, which are called
“the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven,” and the later ritualism
and dogmatic theology of the Churches and Sects. <i>Buddha</i> means the
“Enlightened” by <i>Bodha</i>, or understanding, Wisdom. This has passed
root and branch into the <i>esoteric</i> teachings that Gautama imparted to
his chosen <i>Arhats</i> only.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But some Orientalists deny that
Buddha ever taught any esoteric doctrine at all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They may as well deny that Nature
has any hidden secrets for the men of science. Further on I will prove
it by Buddha’s conversation with his disciple Ananda. His esoteric
teachings were simply the <i>Gupta Vidya</i> (secret knowledge) of the
ancient Brahmins, the key to which their modern successors have, with
few exceptions, completely lost. And this <i>Vidya</i> has passed into what
is now known as the <i>inner</i> teachings of the <i>Mahayana</i> school of
Northern Buddhism. Those who deny it are simply ignorant pretenders
to Orientalism. I advise you to read the Rev. Mr. Edkins’ <i>Chinese
Buddhism</i>—especially the chapters on the Exoteric and <i>Esoteric</i>
schools and teachings—and then compare the testimony of the whole
ancient world upon the subject.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But are not the ethics of Theosophy identical with
those taught by Buddha?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly, because these ethics are the soul of
the Wisdom-Religion, and were once the common property of the
initiates of all nations. But Buddha was the first to embody
these lofty ethics in his public teachings, and to make them
the foundation and the very essence of his public system. It
is herein that lies the immense difference between exoteric
Buddhism and every other religion. For while in other religions
ritualism and dogma hold the first and most important place,
in Buddhism it is the ethics which have always been the most
insisted upon. This accounts for the resemblance, amounting
almost to identity, between the ethics of Theosophy and those of
the religion of Buddha.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Are there any great points of
difference?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> One great distinction between
Theosophy and <i>exoteric</i> Buddhism is that the latter, represented by
the Southern Church, entirely denies (a) the existence of any Deity,
and (b) any conscious <i>post-mortem</i> life, or even any self-conscious
surviving individuality in man. Such at least is the teaching of the
Siamese sect, now considered as the <i>purest</i> form of exoteric Buddhism.
And it is so, if we refer only to Buddha’s public teachings; the reason
for such reticence on his part I will give further on. But the schools
of the Northern Buddhist Church, established in those countries to
which his initiated Arhats retired after the Master’s death, teach
all that is now called Theosophical doctrines, because they form part
of the knowledge of the initiates—thus proving how the truth has been
sacrificed to the dead-letter by the too-zealous orthodoxy of Southern
Buddhism. But how much grander and more noble, philosophical and
scientific, even in its dead-letter, is this teaching than that of any
other Church or religion. Yet Theosophy is not Buddhism.

<h2>II. <br>EXOTERIC AND ESOTERIC THEOSOPHY.</h2></div>
<h3>WHAT THE MODERN THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY IS NOT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Your doctrines, then, are not a
revival of Buddhism, nor are they entirely copied from the Neo-Platonic
Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are not. But to these
questions I cannot give you a better answer than by quoting from a
paper read on “Theosophy” by Dr. J. D. Buck, F.T.S., before the last
Theosophical Convention, at Chicago, America (April, 1889). No living
theosophist has better expressed and understood the real essence of
Theosophy than our honoured friend Dr. Buck:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“The Theosophical Society was organized for
the purpose of promulgating the Theosophical doctrines, and for the
promotion of the Theosophic life. The present Theosophical Society is
not the first of its kind. I have a volume entitled: ‘Theosophical
Transactions of the Philadelphian Society,’ published in London in
1697; and another with the following title: ‘Introduction to Theosophy,
or the Science of the Mystery of Christ; that is, of Deity, Nature, and
Creature, embracing the philosophy of all the working powers of life,
magical and spiritual, and forming a practical guide to the sublimest
purity, sanctity, and evangelical perfection; also to the attainment
of divine vision, and the holy angelic arts, potencies, and other
prerogatives of the regeneration,’ published in London in 1855. The
following is the dedication of this volume:</p>
<p class="blockquot2">‘To the students of Universities, Colleges, and
schools of Christendom: To Professors of Metaphysical, Mechanical,
and Natural Science in all its forms: To men and women of Education
generally, of fundamental orthodox faith: To Deists, Arians,
Unitarians, Swedenborgians, and other defective and ungrounded
creeds, rationalists, and sceptics of every kind: To just-minded and
enlightened Mohammedans, Jews, and oriental Patriarch-religionists:
but especially to the gospel minister and missionary, whether to the
barbaric or intellectual peoples, this introduction to Theosophy, or
the science of the ground and mystery of all things, is most humbly and
affectionately dedicated.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">In the following year (1856) another volume was
issued, royal octavo, of 600 pages, diamond type, of ‘Theosophical
Miscellanies.’ Of the last-named work 500 copies only were issued, for
gratuitous distribution to Libraries and Universities. These earlier
movements, of which there were many, originated within the Church, with
persons of great piety and earnestness, and of unblemished character;
and all of these writings were in orthodox form, using the Christian
expressions, and, like the writings of the eminent Churchman William
Law, would only be distinguished by the ordinary reader for their great
earnestness and piety. These were one and all but attempts to derive
and explain the deeper meanings and original import of the Christian
Scriptures, and to illustrate and unfold the Theosophic life. These
works were soon forgotten, and are now generally unknown. They sought
to reform the clergy and revive genuine piety, and were never welcomed.
That one word, “Heresy,” was sufficient to bury them in the limbo of
all such Utopias. At the time of the Reformation John Reuchlin made a
similar attempt with the same result, though he was the intimate and
trusted friend of Luther. Orthodoxy never desired to be informed and
enlightened. These reformers were informed, as was Paul by Festus, that
too much learning had made them mad, and that it would be dangerous
to go farther. Passing by the verbiage, which was partly a matter of
habit and education with these writers, and partly due to religious
restraint through secular power, and coming to the core of the matter,
these writings were Theosophical in the strictest sense, and pertain
solely to man’s knowledge of his own nature and the higher life of the
soul. The present Theosophical movement has sometimes been declared to
be an attempt to convert Christendom to Buddhism, which means simply
that the word ‘Heresy’ has lost its terrors and relinquished its power.
Individuals in every age have more or less clearly apprehended the
Theosophical doctrines and wrought them into the fabric of their lives.
These doctrines belong exclusively to no religion, and are confined to
no society or time. They are the birthright of every human soul. Such a
thing as orthodoxy must be wrought out by each individual according to
his nature and his needs, and according to his varying experience. This
may explain why those who have imagined Theosophy to be a new religion
have hunted in vain for its creed and its ritual. Its creed is Loyalty
to Truth, and its ritual ‘To honour every truth by use.’
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">How little this principle of Universal Brotherhood
is understood by the masses of mankind, how seldom its transcendent
importance is recognised, may be seen in the diversity of opinion and
fictitious interpretations regarding the Theosophical Society. This
Society was organized on this one principle, the essential Brotherhood
of Man, as herein briefly outlined and imperfectly set forth. It has
been assailed as Buddhistic and anti-Christian, as though it could
be both these together, when both Buddhism and Christianity, as set
forth by their inspired founders, make brotherhood the one essential
of doctrine and of life. Theosophy has been also regarded as something
new under the sun, or at best as old mysticism masquerading under a new
name. While it is true that many Societies founded upon, and united to
support, the principles of altruism, or essential brotherhood, have
borne various names, it is also true that many have also been called
Theosophic, and with principles and aims as the present society bearing
that name. With these societies, one and all, the essential doctrine
has been the same, and all else has been incidental, though this does
not obviate the fact that many persons are attracted to the incidentals
who overlook or ignore the essentials.”</p>
<p class="no-indent">No better or more explicit answer—by a man who is
one of our most esteemed and earnest Theosophists—could be given to
your questions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Which system do you prefer or
follow, in that case, besides Buddhistic ethics?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> None, and all. We hold to no
religion, as to no philosophy in particular: we cull the good we find
in each. But here, again, it must be stated that, like all other
ancient systems, Theosophy is divided into Exoteric and <i>Esoteric</i>
Sections.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The members of the Theosophical
Society at large are free to profess whatever religion or philosophy
they like, or none if they so prefer, provided they are in sympathy
with, and ready to carry out one or more of the three objects of the
Association. The Society is a philanthropic and scientific body for
the propagation of the idea of brotherhood on <i>practical</i> instead of
<i>theoretical</i> lines. The Fellows may be Christians or Mussulmen, Jews
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
or Parsees, Buddhists or Brahmins, Spiritualists or Materialists, it
does not matter; but every member must be either a philanthropist, or a
scholar, a searcher into Aryan and other old literature, or a psychic
student. In short, he has to help, if he can, in the carrying out of at
least one of the objects of the programme. Otherwise he has no reason
for becoming a “Fellow.” Such are the majority of the exoteric Society,
composed of “attached” and “unattached” members.<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6_6">[6]</a>
These may, or may not, become Theosophists <i>de facto</i>. Members they
are, by virtue of their having joined the Society; but the latter
cannot make a Theosophist of one who has no sense for the <i>divine</i>
fitness of things, or of him who understands Theosophy in his own—if
the expression may be used—<i>sectarian</i> and egotistic way. “Handsome is,
as handsome does” could be paraphrased in this case and be made to run:
“Theosophist is, who Theosophy does.”</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_2_2"></a>THEOSOPHISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE “T.S.”</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This applies to lay members, as
I understand. And what of those who pursue the esoteric study of
Theosophy; are they the real Theosophists?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not necessarily, until they have
proven themselves to be such. They have entered the inner group and
pledged themselves to carry out, as strictly as they can, the rules
of the occult body. This is a difficult undertaking, as the foremost
rule of all is the entire renunciation of one’s personality—<i>i.e.</i>, a
<i>pledged</i> member has to become a thorough altruist, never to think of
himself, and to forget his own vanity and pride in the thought of the
good of his fellow-creatures, besides that of his fellow-brothers in
the esoteric circle. He has to live, if the esoteric instructions shall
profit him, a life of abstinence in everything, of self-denial and
strict morality, doing his duty by all men. The few real Theosophists
in the T.S. are among these members. This does not imply that outside
of the T.S. and the inner circle, there are no Theosophists; for there
are, and more than people know of; certainly far more than are found
among the lay members of the T.S.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then what is the good of joining the
so-called Theosophical Society in that case? Where is the incentive?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> None, except the advantage
of getting esoteric instructions, the genuine doctrines of the
“Wisdom-Religion,” and if the real programme is carried out, deriving
much help from mutual aid and sympathy. Union is strength and harmony,
and well-regulated simultaneous efforts produce wonders. This has
been the secret of all associations and communities since mankind
existed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why could not a man of
well-balanced mind and singleness of purpose, one, say, of indomitable
energy and perseverance, become an Occultist and even an Adept if he
works alone?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> He may; but there are ten thousand
chances against one that he will fail. For one reason out of many
others, no books on Occultism or Theurgy exist in our day which give
out the secrets of alchemy or mediæval Theosophy in plain language. All
are symbolical or in parables; and as the key to these has been lost
for ages in the West, how can a man learn the correct meaning of what
he is reading and studying? Therein lies the greatest danger, one that
leads to unconscious <i>black</i> magic or the most helpless mediumship. He
who has not an Initiate for a master had better leave the dangerous
study alone. Look around you and observe. While two-thirds of
<i>civilized</i> society ridicule the mere notion that there is anything
in Theosophy, Occultism, Spiritualism, or in the Kabala, the other
third is composed of the most heterogeneous and opposite elements.
Some believe in the mystical, and even in the <i>supernatural</i> (!), but
each believes in his own way. Others will rush single-handed into the
study of the Kabala, Psychism, Mesmerism, Spiritualism, or some form or
another of Mysticism. Result: no two men think alike, no two are agreed
upon any fundamental occult principles, though many are those who claim
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
for themselves the <i>ultima thule</i> of knowledge, and would make
outsiders believe that they are full-blown adepts. Not only is there
no scientific and accurate knowledge of Occultism accessible in the
West—not even of true astrology, the only branch of Occultism which, in
its <i>exoteric</i> teachings, has definite laws and a definite system—but
no one has any idea of what real Occultism means. Some limit ancient
wisdom to the <i>Kabala</i> and the Jewish <i>Zohar</i>, which each interprets
in his own way according to the dead-letter of the Rabbinical methods.
Others regard Swedenborg or Boehme as the ultimate expressions of the
highest wisdom; while others again see in mesmerism the great secret of
ancient magic. One and all of those who put their theory into practice
are rapidly drifting, through ignorance, into black magic. Happy are
those who escape from it, as they have neither test nor criterion by
which they can distinguish between the true and the false.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Are we to understand that the inner
group of the T.S. claims to learn what it does from real initiates or
masters of esoteric wisdom?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not directly. The personal presence
of such masters is not required. Suffice it if they give instructions
to some of those who have studied under their guidance for years,
and devoted their whole lives to their service. Then, in turn, these
can give out the knowledge so imparted to others, who had no such
opportunity. A portion of the true sciences is better than a mass of
undigested and misunderstood learning. An ounce of gold is worth a ton
of dust.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how is one to know whether the
ounce is real gold or only a counterfeit?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> A tree is known by its fruit, a
system by its results. When our opponents are able to prove to us that
any solitary student of Occultism throughout the ages has become a
saintly adept like Ammonius Saccas, or even a Plotinus, or a Theurgist
like Iamblichus, or achieved feats such as are claimed to have been
done by St. Germain, without any master to guide him, and all this
without being a medium, a self-deluded psychic, or a charlatan—then
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
shall we confess ourselves mistaken. But till then, Theosophists
prefer to follow the proven natural law of the tradition of the Sacred
Science. There are mystics who have made great discoveries in chemistry
and physical sciences, almost bordering on alchemy and Occultism;
others who, by the sole aid of their genius, have rediscovered
portions, if not the whole, of the lost alphabets of the “Mystery
language,” and are, therefore, able to read correctly Hebrew scrolls;
others still, who, being seers, have caught wonderful <i>glimpses</i> of the
hidden secrets of Nature. But all these are <i>specialists</i>. One is a
theoretical inventor, another a Hebrew, <i>i.e.</i>, a Sectarian Kabalist, a
third a Swedenborg of modern times, denying all and everything outside
of his own particular science or religion. Not one of them can boast
of having produced a universal or even a national benefit thereby,
not even to himself. With the exception of a few healers—of that
class which the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons would call
quacks—none have helped with their science Humanity, nor even a number
of men of the same community. Where are the Chaldees of old, those who
wrought marvellous cures, “not by charms but by simples”? Where is an
Apollonius of Tyana, who healed the sick and raised the dead under any
climate and circumstances? We know some <i>specialists</i> of the former
class in Europe, but none of the latter—except in Asia, where the
secret of the Yogi, “to live in death,” is still preserved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is the production of such healing
adepts the aim of Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Its aims are several; but the most
important of all are those which are likely to lead to the relief of
human suffering under any or every form, moral as well as physical.
And we believe the former to be far more important than the latter.
Theosophy has to inculcate ethics; it has to purify the soul, if
it would relieve the physical body, whose ailments, save cases of
accidents, are all hereditary. It is not by studying Occultism for
selfish ends, for the gratification of one’s personal ambition, pride,
or vanity, that one can ever reach the true goal: that of helping
suffering mankind. Nor is it by studying one single branch of the
esoteric philosophy that a man becomes an Occultist, but by studying,
if not mastering, them all.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is help, then, to reach this most
important aim, given only to those who study the esoteric sciences?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all. Every <i>lay</i> member
is entitled to general instruction if he only wants it; but few are
willing to become what is called “working members,” and most prefer to
remain the <i>drones</i> of Theosophy. Let it be understood that private
research is encouraged in the T.S., provided it does not infringe the
limit which separates the exoteric from the esoteric, the <i>blind</i> from
the <i>conscious</i> magic.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_2_3"></a>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEOSOPHY AND SPIRITUALISM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You speak of Theosophy and
Occultism; are they identical?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> By no means. A man may be a very
good Theosophist indeed, whether <i>in</i> or <i>outside</i> of the Society,
without being in any way an Occultist. But no one can be a true
Occultist without being a real Theosophist; otherwise he is simply a
black magician, whether conscious or unconscious.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I have said already that a true
Theosophist must put in practice the loftiest moral ideal, must strive
to realize his unity with the whole of humanity, and work ceaselessly
for others. Now, if an Occultist does not do all this, he must act
selfishly for his own personal benefit; and if he has acquired more
practical power than other ordinary men, he becomes forthwith a far
more dangerous enemy to the world and those around him than the average
mortal. This is clear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then is an Occultist simply a man
who possesses more power than other people?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Far more—if he is a <i>practical</i> and
really learned Occultist, and not one only in name. Occult sciences are
<i>not</i>, as described, in Encyclopædias, “those <i>imaginary</i> sciences of
the Middle Ages which related to the <i>supposed</i> action or influence of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Occult qualities or supernatural powers, as alchemy, magic, necromancy,
and astrology,” for they are real, actual, and very dangerous sciences.
They teach the secret potency of things in Nature, developing and
cultivating the hidden powers “latent in man,” thus giving him
tremendous advantages over more ignorant mortals. Hypnotism, now
become so common and a subject of serious scientific inquiry, is a
good instance in point. <i>Hypnotic</i> power has been discovered almost
by accident, the way to it having been prepared by mesmerism; and now
an able hypnotizer can do almost anything with it, from forcing a
man, unconsciously to himself, to play the fool, to making him commit
a crime—often by proxy for the hypnotizer, and <i>for the benefit of
the latter</i>. Is not this a terrible power if left in the hands of
unscrupulous persons? And please to remember that this is only one of
the minor branches of Occultism.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But are not all these Occult
sciences, magic, and sorcery, considered by the most cultured and
learned people as relics of ancient ignorance and superstition?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Let me remind you that this
remark of yours cuts both ways. The “most cultured and learned” among
you regard also Christianity and every other religion as a relic of
ignorance and superstition. People begin to believe now, at any rate,
in <i>hypnotism</i>, and some—even of the <i>most cultured</i>—in Theosophy and
phenomena. But who among them, except preachers and blind fanatics,
will confess to a belief in <i>Biblical miracles</i>? And this is where
the point of difference comes in. There are very good and pure
Theosophists who may believe in the supernatural, divine <i>miracles</i>
included, but no Occultist will do so. For an Occultist practices
<i>scientific</i> Theosophy, based on accurate knowledge of Nature’s secret
workings; but a Theosophist, practising the powers called abnormal,
<i>minus</i> the light of Occultism, will simply tend toward a dangerous
form of mediumship, because, although holding to Theosophy and its
highest conceivable code of ethics, he practises it in the dark, on
sincere but <i>blind</i> faith. Anyone, Theosophist or Spiritualist, who
attempts to cultivate one of the branches of Occult science—<i>e.g.</i>,
Hypnotism, Mesmerism, or even the secrets of producing physical
phenomena, etc.—without the knowledge of the philosophic <i>rationale</i> of
those powers, is like a rudderless boat launched on a stormy ocean.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_2_4"></a>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEOSOPHY AND SPIRITUALISM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But do you not believe in
Spiritualism?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If by “Spiritualism” you mean the
explanation which Spiritualists give of some abnormal phenomena, then
decidedly <i>we do not</i>. They maintain that these manifestations are
all produced by the “spirits” of departed mortals, generally their
relatives, who return to earth, they say, to communicate with those
they have loved or to whom they are attached. We deny this point blank.
We assert that the spirits of the dead cannot return to earth—save
in rare and exceptional cases, of which I may speak later; nor do
they communicate with men except by <i>entirely subjective means</i>. That
which does appear objectively, is only the phantom of the ex-physical
man. But in <i>psychic</i>, and so to say, “Spiritual” Spiritualism, we do
believe, most decidedly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you reject the phenomena also?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Assuredly not—save cases of
conscious fraud.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How do you account for them, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In many ways. The causes of
such manifestations are by no means so simple as the Spiritualists
would like to believe. Foremost of all, the <i>deus ex machinâ</i> of the
so-called “materializations” is usually the astral body or “double”
of the medium or of some one present. This <i>astral</i> body is also the
producer or operating force in the manifestations of slate-writing,
“Davenport”-like manifestations, and so on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You say “usually”; then <i>what</i>
is it that produces the rest?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That depends on the nature of the
manifestations. Sometimes the astral remains, the Kamalokic “shells”
of the vanished <i>personalities</i> that were; at other times, Elementals.
“Spirit” is a word of manifold and wide significance. I really do
not know what Spiritualists mean by the term; but what we understand
them to claim is that the physical phenomena are produced by the
reincarnating <i>Ego</i>, the <i>Spiritual</i> and immortal “individuality.” And
this hypothesis we entirely reject. The Conscious <i>Individuality</i> of
the disembodied <i>cannot materialize</i>, nor can it return from
its own mental Devachanic sphere to the plane of terrestrial objectivity.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But many of the communications
received from the “spirits” show not only intelligence, but a knowledge
of facts not known to the medium, and sometimes even not consciously
present to the mind of the investigator, or any of those who compose
the audience.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This does not necessarily prove
that the intelligence and knowledge you speak of belong to <i>spirits</i>,
or emanate from <i>disembodied</i> souls. Somnambulists have been known to
compose music and poetry and to solve mathematical problems while in
their trance state, without having ever learnt music or mathematics.
Others answered intelligently to questions put to them, and even, in
several cases, spoke languages, such as Hebrew and Latin, of which
they were entirely ignorant when awake—all this in a state of profound
sleep. Will you, then, maintain that this was caused by “spirits”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how would you explain it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We assert that the divine spark
in man being one and identical in its essence with the Universal
Spirit, our “spiritual Self” is practically omniscient, but that it
cannot manifest its knowledge owing to the impediments of matter. Now
the more these impediments are removed, in other words, the more the
physical body is paralyzed, as to its own independent activity and
consciousness, as in deep sleep or deep trance, or, again, in illness,
the more fully can the <i>inner</i> Self manifest on this plane. This is
our explanation of those truly wonderful phenomena of a higher order,
in which undeniable intelligence and knowledge are exhibited. As to
the lower order of manifestations, such as physical phenomena and the
platitudes and common talk of the general “spirit,” to explain even the
most important of the teachings we hold upon the subject would take up
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
more space and time than can be allotted to it at present. We have no
desire to interfere with the belief of the Spiritualists any more than
with any other belief. The <i>onus probandi</i> must fall on the believers
in “spirits.” And at the present moment, while still convinced that
the higher sort of manifestations occur through the disembodied
souls, their leaders and the most learned and intelligent among the
Spiritualists are the first to confess that not <i>all</i> the phenomena
are produced by spirits. Gradually they will come to recognize the
whole truth; but meanwhile we have no right nor desire to proselytize
them to our views. The less so, as in the cases of purely <i>psychic and
spiritual manifestations</i> we believe in the intercommunication of the
spirit of the living man with that of disembodied personalities.<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7_7">[7]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This means that you reject the
philosophy of Spiritualism <i>in toto</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If by “philosophy” you mean their
crude theories, we do. But they have no philosophy, in truth. Their
best, their most intellectual and earnest defenders say so. Their
fundamental and only unimpeachable truth, namely, that phenomena occur
through mediums controlled by invisible forces and intelligences—no
one, except a blind materialist of the “Huxley big toe” school, will
or <i>can</i> deny. With regard to their philosophy, however, let me read
to you what the able editor of <i>Light</i>, than whom the Spiritualists
will find no wiser nor more devoted champion, says of them and
their philosophy. This is what “M.A. Oxon,” one of the very few
<i>philosophical</i> Spiritualists, writes, with respect to their lack of
organization and blind bigotry:—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">It is worth while to look steadily at this point, for
it is of vital moment. We have an experience and a knowledge beside
which all other knowledge is comparatively insignificant. The ordinary
Spiritualist waxes wroth if anyone ventures to impugn his assured
knowledge of the future and his absolute certainty of the life to come.
Where other men have stretched forth feeble hands groping into the dark
future, he walks boldly as one who has a chart and knows his way. Where
other men have stopped short at a pious aspiration or have been content
with a hereditary faith, it is his boast that he knows what they only
believe, and that out of his rich stores he can supplement the fading
faiths built only upon hope. He is magnificent in his dealings with
man’s most cherished expectations. “You hope,” he seems to say, “for
that which I can demonstrate. You have accepted a traditional belief in
what I can experimentally prove according to the strictest scientific
method. The old beliefs are fading; come out from them and be separate.
They contain as much falsehood as truth. Only by building on a sure
foundation of demonstrated fact can your superstructure be stable. All
round you old faiths are toppling. Avoid the crash and get you out.”</p>
<p class="indent">When one comes to deal with this magnificent
person in a practical way, what is the result? Very curious and very
disappointing. He is so sure of his ground that he takes no trouble
to ascertain the interpretation which others put upon his facts. The
wisdom of the ages has concerned itself with the explanation of what
he rightly regards as proven; but he does not turn a passing glance
on its researches. He does not even agree altogether with his brother
Spiritualist. It is the story over again of the old Scotch body who,
together with her husband, formed a “kirk.” They had exclusive keys
to Heaven, or, rather, she had, for she was “na certain aboot Jamie.”
So the infinitely divided and subdivided and resubdivided sects of
Spiritualists shake their heads, and are “na certain aboot” one
another. Again, the collective experience of mankind is solid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and unvarying on this point that union is strength, and disunion a
source of weakness and failure. Shoulder to shoulder, drilled and
disciplined, a rabble becomes an army, each man a match for a hundred
of the untrained men that may be brought against it. Organization
in every department of man’s work means success, saving of time and
labour, profit and development. Want of method, want of plan, haphazard
work, fitful energy, undisciplined effort—these mean bungling failure.
The voice of humanity attests the truth. Does the Spiritualist accept
the verdict and act on the conclusion? Verily, no. He refuses to
organize. He is a law unto himself, and a thorn in the side of his
neighbours.—<i>Light</i>, June 22, 1889.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I was told that the Theosophical
Society was originally founded to crush Spiritualism and belief in the
survival of the individuality in man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You are misinformed. Our beliefs
are all founded on that immortal individuality. But then, like so many
others, you confuse <i>personality</i> with individuality. Your Western
psychologists do not seem to have established any clear distinction
between the two. Yet it is precisely that difference which gives the
key-note to the understanding of Eastern philosophy, and which lies at
the root of the divergence between the Theosophical and Spiritualistic
teachings. And though it may draw upon us still more the hostility of
some Spiritualists, yet I must state here that it is Theosophy which
is the <i>true</i> and unalloyed Spiritualism, while the modern scheme of
that name is, as now practised by the masses, simply transcendental
materialism.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Please explain your idea more clearly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What I mean is that though our
teachings insist upon the identity of spirit and matter, and though we
say that spirit is <i>potential</i> matter, and matter simply crystallized
spirit (<i>e.g.</i>, as ice is solidified steam), yet since the original
and eternal condition of <i>all</i> is not spirit but <i>meta</i>-spirit, so
to speak, (visible and solid matter being simply its periodical
manifestation,) we maintain that the term spirit can only be applied to
the <i>true</i> individuality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what is the distinction between
this “true individuality” and the “I” or “Ego” of which we are all conscious?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Before I can answer you, we must
argue upon what you mean by “I” or “Ego.” We distinguish between
the simple fact of self-consciousness, the simple feeling that
“I am I,” and the complex thought that “I am Mr. Smith” or “Mrs.
Brown.” Believing as we do in a series of births for the same Ego,
or re-incarnation, this distinction is the fundamental pivot of the
whole idea. You see “Mr. Smith” really means a long series of daily
experiences strung together by the thread of memory, and forming what
Mr. Smith calls “himself.” But none of these “experiences” are really
the “I” or the Ego, nor do they give “Mr. Smith” the feeling that he
is himself, for he forgets the greater part of his daily experiences,
and they produce the feeling of <i>Egoity</i> in him only while they
last. We Theosophists, therefore, distinguish between this bundle
of “experiences,” which we call the <i>false</i> (because so finite and
evanescent) <i>personality</i>, and that element in man to which the feeling
of “I am I” is due. It is this “I am I” which we call the <i>true</i>
individuality; and we say that this “Ego” or individuality plays, like
an actor, many parts on the stage of life.<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8_8">[8]</a>
Let us call every new life on earth of the same <i>Ego</i> a <i>night</i> on
the stage of a theatre. One night the actor, or “Ego,” appears as
“Macbeth,” the next as “Shylock,” the third as “Romeo,” the fourth as
“Hamlet” or “King Lear,” and so on, until he has run through the whole
cycle of incarnations. The Ego begins his life-pilgrimage as a sprite,
an “Ariel,” or a “Puck”; he plays the part of a <i>super</i>, is a soldier,
a servant, one of the chorus; rises then to “speaking parts,” plays
leading <i>rôles</i>, interspersed with insignificant parts, till he finally
retires from the stage as “Prospero,” the <i>magician</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I understand. You say, then,
that this true <i>Ego</i> cannot return to earth after death. But surely
the actor is at liberty, if he has preserved the sense of his
individuality, to return if he likes to the scene of his former actions?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We say not, simply because such a
return to earth would be incompatible with any state of <i>unalloyed</i>
bliss after death, as I am prepared to prove. We say that man suffers
so much unmerited misery during his life, through the fault of others
with whom he is associated, or because of his environment, that he is
surely entitled to perfect rest and quiet, if not bliss, before taking
up again the burden of life. However, we can discuss this in detail later.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_2_5"></a>WHY IS THEOSOPHY ACCEPTED?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I understand to a certain extent;
but I see that your teachings are far more complicated and metaphysical
than either Spiritualism or current religious thought. Can you tell me,
then, what has caused this system of Theosophy which you support to
arouse so much interest and so much animosity at the same time?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> There are several reasons for it,
I believe; among other causes that may be mentioned is, <i>firstly</i>, the
great reaction from the crassly materialistic theories now prevalent
among scientific teachers. <i>Secondly</i>, general dissatisfaction with
the artificial theology of the various Christian Churches, and the
number of daily increasing and conflicting sects. <i>Thirdly</i>, an
ever-growing perception of the fact that the creeds which are so
obviously self—and mutually—contradictory <i>cannot be true</i>, and that
claims which are unverified <i>cannot be real</i>. This natural distrust of
conventional religions is only strengthened by their complete failure
to preserve morals and to purify society and the masses. <i>Fourthly</i>, a
conviction on the part of many, and <i>knowledge</i> by a few, that there
must be somewhere a philosophical and religious system which shall be
scientific and not merely speculative. <i>Finally</i>, a belief, perhaps,
that such a system must be sought for in teachings far antedating any
modern faith.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how did this system come to be
put forward just now?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just because the time was found
to be ripe, which fact is shown by the determined effort of so many
earnest students to reach <i>the truth</i>, at whatever cost and wherever
it may be concealed. Seeing this, its custodians permitted that
some portions at least of that truth should be proclaimed. Had the
formation of the Theosophical Society been postponed a few years
longer, one half of the civilized nations would have become by
this time rank materialists, and the other half anthropomorphists
and phenomenalists.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Are we to regard Theosophy in any
way as a revelation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In no way whatever—not even in the
sense of a new and direct disclosure from some higher, supernatural,
or, at least, <i>superhuman beings</i>; but only in the sense of an
“unveiling” of old, very old, truths to minds hitherto ignorant of
them, ignorant even of the existence and preservation of any such
archaic knowledge.<a id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9_9">[9]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You spoke of “Persecution.” If truth
is as represented by Theosophy, why has it met with such opposition,
and with no general acceptance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> For many and various reasons again,
one of which is the hatred felt by men for “innovations,” as they
call them. Selfishness is essentially conservative, and hates being
disturbed. It prefers an easy-going, unexacting <i>lie</i> to the greatest
truth, if the latter requires the sacrifice of one’s smallest comfort.
The power of mental inertia is great in anything that does not promise
immediate benefit and reward. Our age is pre-eminently unspiritual
and matter of fact. Moreover, there is the unfamiliar character of
Theosophic teachings; the highly abstruse nature of the doctrines, some
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
of which contradict flatly many of the human vagaries cherished by
sectarians, which have eaten into the very core of popular beliefs. If
we add to this the personal efforts and great purity of life exacted
of those who would become the disciples of the <i>inner</i> circle, and the
very limited class to which an entirely unselfish code appeals, it will
be easy to perceive the reason why Theosophy is doomed to such slow,
uphill work. It is essentially the philosophy of those who suffer, and
have lost all hope of being helped out of the mire of life by any other
means. Moreover, the history of any system of belief or morals, newly
introduced into a foreign soil, shows that its beginnings were impeded
by every obstacle that obscurantism and selfishness could suggest. “The
crown of the innovator is a crown of thorns” indeed! No pulling down of
old, worm-eaten buildings can be accomplished without some danger.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> All this refers rather to the ethics
and philosophy of the T.S. Can you give me a general idea of the
Society itself, its object and statutes?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This was never made secret. Ask,
and you shall receive accurate answers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But I heard that you were bound by
pledges?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Only in the <i>Arcane</i> or “Esoteric”
Section.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And also, that some members after
leaving did not regard themselves bound by them. Are they right?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This shows that their idea of
honour is an imperfect one. How can they be right? As well said in
the <i>Path</i>, our theosophical organ at New York, treating of such a
case: “Suppose that a soldier is tried for infringement of oath and
discipline, and is dismissed from the service. In his rage at the
justice he has called down, and of whose penalties he was distinctly
forewarned, the soldier turns to the enemy with false information,—a
spy and traitor—as a revenge upon his former Chief, and claims that
his punishment has released him from his oath of loyalty to a cause.”
Is he justified, think you? Don’t you think he deserves being called a
dishonourable man, a coward?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I believe so; but some think
otherwise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> So much the worse for them. But we
will talk on this subject later, if you please.

<h2>III. <br>THE WORKING SYSTEM OF THE
T.S.<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10_10">[10]</a></h2></div>
<h3>THE OBJECTS OF THE SOCIETY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are the objects of the
“Theosophical Society”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are three, and have been so
from the beginning. (1). To form the nucleus of a Universal Brotherhood
of Humanity without distinction of race, colour, or creed. (2). To
promote the study of Aryan and other Scriptures, of the World’s
religion and sciences, and to vindicate the importance of old Asiatic
literature, namely, of the Brahmanical, Buddhist, and Zoroastrian
philosophies. (3). To investigate the hidden mysteries of Nature under
every aspect possible, and the psychic and spiritual powers latent in
man especially. These are, broadly stated, the three chief objects of
the Theosophical Society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you give me some more detailed
information upon these?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We may divide each of the three
objects into as many explanatory clauses as may be found necessary.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then let us begin with the first.
What means would you resort to, in order to promote such a feeling of
brotherhood among races that are known to be of the most diversified
religions, customs, beliefs, and modes of thought?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Allow me to add that which you seem
unwilling to express. Of course we know that with the exception of two
remnants of races—the Parsees and the Jews—every nation is divided,
not merely against all other nations, but even against itself. This is
found most prominently among the so-called civilized Christian nations.
Hence your wonder, and the reason why our first object appears to you a
Utopia. Is it not so?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Well, yes; but what have you to say
against it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Nothing against the fact; but
much about the necessity of removing the causes which make Universal
Brotherhood a Utopia at present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are, in your view, these causes?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> First and foremost, the natural
selfishness of human nature. This selfishness, instead of being
eradicated, is daily strengthened and stimulated into a ferocious and
irresistible feeling by the present religious education, which tends
not only to encourage, but positively to justify it. People’s ideas
about right and wrong have been entirely perverted by the literal
acceptance of the Jewish Bible. All the unselfishness of the altruistic
teachings of Jesus has become merely a theoretical subject for pulpit
oratory; while the precepts of practical selfishness taught in the
Mosaic Bible, against which Christ so vainly preached, have become
ingrained into the innermost life of the Western nations. “An eye for
an eye and a tooth for a tooth” has come to be the first maxim of your
law. Now, I state openly and fearlessly, that the perversity of this
doctrine and of so many others <i>Theosophy alone</i> can eradicate.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_3_2"></a>THE COMMON ORIGIN OF MAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply by demonstrating on logical,
philosophical, metaphysical, and even scientific grounds that:—(a)
All men have spiritually and physically the same origin, which is the
fundamental teaching of Theosophy. (b) As mankind is essentially of
one and the same essence, and that essence is one—infinite, uncreate,
and eternal, whether we call it God or Nature—nothing, therefore, can
affect one nation or one man without affecting all other nations and
all other men. This is as certain and as obvious as that a stone thrown
into a pond will, sooner or later, set in motion every single drop of
water therein.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this is not the teaching of
Christ, but rather a pantheistic notion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That is where your mistake lies. It
is purely <i>Christian</i>, although <i>not</i> Judaic, and therefore, perhaps,
your Biblical nations prefer to ignore it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This is a wholesale and unjust
accusation. Where are your proofs for such a statement?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are ready at hand. Christ is
alleged to have said: “Love each other” and “Love your enemies”; for
“if ye love them (only) which love you, what reward (or merit) have ye?
Do not even the <i>publicans</i><a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11_11">[11]</a>
the same? And if you salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
others? Do not even publicans so?” These are Christ’s words. But
Genesis ix. 25, says “Cursed be Canaan, a servant of servants shall he
be unto his brethren.” And, therefore, Christian but Biblical people
prefer the law of Moses to Christ’s law of love. They base upon the Old
Testament, which panders to all their passions, their laws of conquest,
annexation, and tyranny over races which they call <i>inferior</i>. What
crimes have been committed on the strength of this infernal (if taken
in its dead letter) passage in Genesis, history alone gives us an idea,
however inadequate.<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12_12">[12]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have heard you say that the
identity of our physical origin is proved by science, that of our
spiritual origin by the Wisdom-Religion. Yet we do not find Darwinists
exhibiting great fraternal affection.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just so. This is what shows
the deficiency of the materialistic systems, and proves that we
Theosophists are in the right. The identity of our physical origin
makes no appeal to our higher and deeper feelings. Matter, deprived of
its soul and spirit, or its divine essence, cannot speak to the human
heart. But the identity of the soul and spirit, of real, immortal
man, as Theosophy teaches us, once proven and deep-rooted in our
hearts, would lead us far on the road of real charity and brotherly
goodwill.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how does Theosophy explain the
common origin of man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> By teaching that the <i>root</i> of all
nature, objective and subjective, and everything else in the universe,
visible and invisible, <i>is</i>, <i>was</i>, and <i>ever will be</i> one absolute
essence, from which all starts, and into which everything returns.
This is Aryan philosophy, fully represented only by the Vedantins, and
the Buddhist system. With this object in view, it is the duty of all
Theosophists to promote in every practical way, and in all countries,
the spread of <i>non-sectarian</i> education.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do the written statutes of your
Society advise its members to do besides this? On the physical plane, I mean?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In order to awaken brotherly
feeling among nations we have to assist in the international exchange
of useful arts and products, by advice, information, and co-operation
with all worthy individuals and associations (provided, however,
add the statutes, “that no benefit or percentage shall be taken by
the Society or the ‘Fellows’ for its or their corporate services”).
For instance, to take a practical illustration. The organization of
Society, depicted by Edward Bellamy, in his magnificent work “Looking
Backwards,” admirably represents the Theosophical idea of what should
be the first great step towards the full realization of universal
brotherhood. The state of things he depicts falls short of perfection,
because selfishness still exists and operates in the hearts of men.
But in the main, selfishness and individualism have been overcome by
the feeling of solidarity and mutual brotherhood; and the scheme of
life there described reduces the causes tending to create and foster
selfishness to a minimum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then as a Theosophist you will take
part in an effort to realize such an ideal?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly; and we have proved
it by action. Have not you heard of the Nationalist clubs and party
which have sprung up in America since the publication of Bellamy’s
book? They are now coming prominently to the front, and will do so
more and more as time goes on. Well, these clubs and this party were
started in the first instance by Theosophists. One of the first, the
Nationalist Club of Boston, Mass., has Theosophists for President and
Secretary, and the majority of its executive belong to the T.S. In the
constitution of all their clubs, and of the party they are forming,
the influence of Theosophy and of the Society is plain, for they
all take as their basis, their first and fundamental principle, the
Brotherhood of Humanity as taught by Theosophy. In their declaration of
Principles they state:—“The principle of the Brotherhood of Humanity
is one of the eternal truths that govern the world’s progress on lines
which distinguish human nature from brute nature.” What can be more
Theosophical than this? But it is not enough. What is also needed is to
impress men with the idea that, if the root of mankind is <i>one</i>, then
there must also be one truth which finds expression in all the various
religions—except in the Jewish, as you do not find it <i>expressed</i> even
in the Kabala.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This refers to the common origin
of religions, and you may be right there. But how does it apply to
practical brotherhood on the physical plane?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> First, because that which is true
on the metaphysical plane must be also true on the physical. Secondly,
because there is no more fertile source of hatred and strife than
religious differences. When one party or another thinks himself the
sole possessor of absolute truth, it becomes only natural that he
should think his neighbour absolutely in the clutches of Error or the
Devil. But once get a man to see that none of them has the <i>whole</i>
truth, but that they are mutually complementary, that the complete
truth can be found only in the combined views of all, after that which
is false in each of them has been sifted out—then true brotherhood
in religion will be established. The same applies in the physical
world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Please explain further.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Take an instance. A plant consists
of a root, a stem, and many shoots and leaves. As humanity, as a whole,
is the stem which grows from the spiritual root, so is the stem the
unity of the plant. Hurt the stem and it is obvious that every shoot
and leaf will suffer. So it is with mankind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yes, but if you injure a leaf or a
shoot, you do not injure the whole plant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And therefore you think that by
injuring <i>one</i> man you do not injure humanity? But how do <i>you</i> know?
Are you aware that even materialistic science teaches that any injury,
however slight, to a plant will affect the whole course of its future
growth and development? Therefore, you are mistaken, and the analogy is
perfect. If, however, you overlook the fact that a cut in the finger
may often make the whole body suffer, and react on the whole nervous
system, I must all the more remind you that there may well be other
spiritual laws, operating on plants and animals as well as on mankind,
although, as you do not recognize their action on plants and animals,
you may deny their existence.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What laws do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We call them Karmic laws; but you
will not understand the full meaning of the term unless you study
Occultism. However, my argument did not rest on the assumption of
these laws, but really on the analogy of the plant. Expand the idea,
carry it out to a universal application, and you will soon find that
in true philosophy every physical action has its moral and everlasting
effect. Hurt a man by doing him bodily harm; you may think that his
pain and suffering cannot spread by any means to his neighbours, least
of all to men of other nations. We affirm <i>that it will, in good time</i>.
Therefore, we say, that unless every man is brought to understand and
accept <i>as an axiomatic truth</i> that by wronging one man we wrong not
only ourselves but the whole of humanity in the long run, no brotherly
feelings such as preached by all the great Reformers, pre-eminently by
Buddha and Jesus, are possible on earth.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_3_3"></a>OUR OTHER OBJECTS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Will you now explain the methods by
which you propose to carry out the second object?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To collect for the library at our
headquarters of Adyar, Madras, (and by the Fellows of their Branches
for their local libraries,) all the good works upon the world’s
religions that we can. To put into written form correct information
upon the various ancient philosophies, traditions, and legends, and
disseminate the same in such practicable ways as the translation
and publication of original works of value, and extracts from and
commentaries upon the same, or the oral instructions of persons learned
in their respective departments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what about the third object, to
develop in man his latent spiritual or psychic powers?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This has to be achieved also by
means of publications, in those places where no lectures and personal
teachings are possible. Our duty is to keep alive in man his spiritual
intuitions. To oppose and counteract—after due investigation and proof
of its irrational nature—bigotry in every form, religious, scientific,
or social, and <i>cant</i> above all, whether as religious sectarianism or
as belief in miracles or anything supernatural. What we have to do is
to seek to obtain <i>knowledge</i> of all the laws of nature, and to diffuse
it. To encourage the study of those laws least understood by modern
people, the so-called Occult Sciences, <i>based on the true knowledge
of nature</i>, instead of, as at present, on <i>superstitious beliefs based
on blind faith and authority</i>. Popular folk-lore and traditions,
however fanciful at times, when sifted may lead to the discovery of
long-lost, but important, secrets of nature. The Society, therefore,
aims at pursuing this line of inquiry, in the hope of widening the
field of scientific and philosophical observation.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_3_4"></a>ON THE SACREDNESS OF THE PLEDGE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Have you any ethical system that you
carry out in the Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The ethics are there, ready and
clear enough for whomsoever follow them. They are the essence and
cream of the world’s ethics, gathered from the teachings of all the
world’s great reformers. Therefore, you will find represented therein
Confucius and Zoroaster, Lao-Tze and the Bhagavat-Gita, the precepts of
Gautama Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth, of Hillel and his school, as of
Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and their schools.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do the members of your Society carry
out these precepts? I have heard of great dissensions and quarrels
among them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Very naturally, since although the
reform (in its present shape) may be called new, the men and women to
be reformed are the same human, sinning natures as of old. As already
said, the earnest <i>working</i> members are few; but many are the sincere
and well-disposed persons, who try their best to live up to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Society’s and their own ideals. Our duty is to encourage and assist
individual fellows in self-improvement, intellectual, moral, and
spiritual; not to blame or condemn those who fail. We have, strictly
speaking, no right to refuse admission to anyone—especially in the
<i>Esoteric Section</i> of the Society, wherein “he who enters is as one
newly born.” But if any member, his sacred pledges on his word of
honour and immortal <i>Self</i>, notwithstanding, chooses to continue, after
that “new birth,” with the new man, the vices or defects of his old
life, and to indulge in them still in the Society, then, of course, he
is more than likely to be asked to resign and withdraw; or, in case
of his refusal, to be expelled. We have the strictest rules for such
emergencies.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can some of them be mentioned?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They can. To begin with, no Fellow
in the Society, whether exoteric or esoteric, has a right to force
his personal opinions upon another Fellow. “It is not lawful for <i>any
officer of the Parent Society</i> to express in public, by word or act,
any hostility to, or preference for, any one section,<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13_13">[13]</a>
religious or philosophical, more than another. All have an equal right
to have the essential features of their religious belief laid before
the tribunal of an impartial world. And no officer of the Society, in
his capacity as an officer, has the right to preach his own sectarian
views and beliefs to members assembled, except when the meeting
consists of his co-religionists. After due warning, violation of this
rule shall be punished by suspension or expulsion.” This is one of the
offenses in the Society at large. As regards the inner section, now
called the <i>Esoteric</i>, the following rules have been laid down and
adopted, so far back as 1880. “No Fellow shall put to his selfish use
any knowledge communicated to him by any member of the first section
(now a higher ‘degree’); violation of the rule being punished by
expulsion.” Now, however, before any such knowledge can be imparted,
the applicant has to bind himself by a solemn oath not to use it for
selfish purposes, nor to reveal anything said except by permission.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is a man expelled, or resigning,
from the section free to reveal anything he may have learned, or to
break any clause of the pledge he has taken?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly not. His expulsion or
resignation only relieves him from the obligation of obedience to the
teacher, and from that of taking an active part in the work of the
Society, but surely not from the sacred pledge of secrecy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is this reasonable and just?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most assuredly. To any man or
woman with the slightest honourable feeling a pledge of secrecy taken
even on one’s <i>word of honour</i>, much more to one’s Higher Self—the
God within—is binding till death. And though he may leave the Section
and the Society, no man or woman of honour will think of attacking or
injuring a body to which he or she has been so pledged.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is not this going rather far?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Perhaps so, according to the low
standard of the present time and morality. But if it does not bind as
far as this, what use is a <i>pledge</i> at all? How can anyone expect to be
taught secret knowledge, if he is to be at liberty to free himself from
all the obligations he had taken, whenever he pleases? What security,
confidence, or trust would ever exist among them, if pledges such as
this were to have no really binding force at all? Believe me, the law
of retribution (Karma) would very soon overtake one who so broke his
pledge, and perhaps as soon as the contempt of every honourable man
would, even on this physical plane. As well expressed in the N. Y.
“Path” just cited on this subject, “<i>A pledge once taken, is for ever
binding in both the moral and the occult worlds.</i> If we break it once
and are punished, that does not justify us in breaking it again, and
so long as we do, so long will the mighty lever of the Law (of Karma)
react upon us.” (The <i>Path</i>, July, 1889.)

<h2>IV. <br>THE RELATIONS OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY TO THEOSOPHY.</h2></div>
<h3>ON SELF-IMPROVEMENT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is moral elevation, then, the
principal thing insisted upon in your Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Undoubtedly! He who would be a true
Theosophist must bring himself to live as one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> If so, then, as I remarked before,
the behaviour of some members strangely belies this fundamental
rule.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Indeed it does. But this cannot
be helped among us, any more than amongst those who call themselves
Christians and act like fiends. This is no fault of our statutes and
rules, but that of human nature. Even in some exoteric public branches,
the members pledge themselves on their “Higher Self” to live <i>the</i> life
prescribed by Theosophy. They have to bring their <i>Divine Self</i> to
guide their every thought and action, every day and at every moment
of their lives. A true Theosophist ought “to deal justly and walk
humbly.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean by this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply this: the one self has to
forget itself for the many selves. Let me answer you in the words of
a true Philaletheian, an F.T.S., who has beautifully expressed it in
the <i>Theosophist</i>: “What every man needs first is to find himself, and
then take an honest inventory of his subjective possessions, and, bad
or bankrupt as it may be, it is not beyond redemption if we set about
it in earnest.” But how many do? All are willing to work for their own
development and progress; very few for those of others. To quote the
same writer again: “Men have been deceived and deluded long enough;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
they must break their idols, put away their shams, and go to work for
themselves—nay, there is one little word too much or too many, for
he who works for himself had better not work at all; rather let him
work himself for others, for all. For every flower of love and charity
he plants in his neighbour’s garden, a loathsome weed will disappear
from his own, and so this garden of the gods—Humanity—shall blossom as
a rose. In all Bibles, all religions, this is plainly set forth—but
designing men have at first misinterpreted and finally emasculated,
materialized, besotted them. It does not require a new revelation. Let
every man be a revelation unto himself. Let once man’s immortal spirit
take possession of the temple of his body, drive out the money-changers
and every unclean thing, and his own divine humanity will redeem him,
for when he is thus at one with himself if he will know the ‘builder of
the Temple.’”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This is pure Altruism, I confess.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is. And if only one Fellow of
the T.S. out of ten would practise it ours would be a body of elect
indeed. But there are those among the outsiders who will always refuse
to see the essential difference between Theosophy and the Theosophical
Society, the idea and its imperfect embodiment. Such would visit
every sin and shortcoming of the vehicle, the human body, on the pure
spirit which sheds thereon its divine light. Is this just to either?
They throw stones at an association that tries to work up to, and
for the propagation of, its ideal with most tremendous odds against
it. Some vilify the Theosophical Society only because it presumes to
attempt to do that in which other systems—Church and State Christianity
pre-eminently—have failed most egregiously; others because they would
fain preserve the existing state of things: Pharisees and Sadducees in
the seat of Moses, and publicans and sinners revelling in high places,
as under the Roman Empire during its decadence. Fair-minded people, at
any rate, ought to remember that the man who does all he can, does as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
much as he who has achieved the most, in this world of relative
possibilities. This is a simple truism, an axiom supported for
believers in the Gospels by the parable of the talents given by their
Master; the servant who doubled his two talents was rewarded as much as
that other fellow-servant who had received <i>five</i>. To every man it is
given “according to his several ability.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet it is rather difficult to draw
the line of demarcation between the abstract and the concrete in this
case, as we have only the latter to our judgment by.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then why make an exception for the
T.S.? Justice, like charity, ought to begin at home. Will you revile
and scoff at the “Sermon on the Mount” because your social, political
and even religious laws have, so far, not only failed to carry out its
precepts in their spirit, but even in their dead letter? Abolish the
oath in Courts, Parliament, Army and everywhere, and do as the Quakers
do, if you <i>will</i> call yourselves Christians. Abolish the Courts
themselves, for if you would follow the Commandments of Christ, you
have to give away your coat to him who deprives you of your cloak, and
turn your left cheek to the bully who smites you on the right. “Resist
not evil, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you,” for “whosoever shall break one of the least of these
Commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in
the Kingdom of Heaven,” and “whosoever shall say ‘Thou fool’ shall be
in danger of hell fire.” And why should you judge, if you would not be
judged in your turn? Insist that between Theosophy and the Theosophical
Society there is no difference, and forthwith you lay the system of
Christianity and its very essence open to the same charges, only in a
more serious form.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Why <i>more</i> serious?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because, while the leaders of the
Theosophical movement, recognising fully their shortcomings, try all
they can do to amend their ways and uproot the evil existing in the
Society; and while their rules and by-laws are framed in the spirit of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Theosophy, the Legislators and the Churches of nations and countries
which call themselves Christian do the reverse. Our members, even the
worst among them, are no worse than the average Christian. Moreover,
if the Western Theosophists experience so much difficulty in leading
the true Theosophical life, it is because they are all the children of
their generation. Every one of them was a Christian, bred and brought
up in the sophistry of his Church, his social customs, and even his
paradoxical laws. He was this before he became a Theosophist, or
rather, a member of the Society of that name, as it cannot be too often
repeated that between the abstract ideal and its vehicle there is a
most important difference.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_4_2"></a>THE ABSTRACT AND THE CONCRETE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Please elucidate this difference a
little more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The Society is a great body of men
and women, composed of the most heterogeneous elements. Theosophy,
in its abstract meaning, is Divine Wisdom, or the aggregate of the
knowledge and wisdom that underlie the Universe—the homogeneity of
eternal GOOD; and in its concrete sense it is the sum total of the
same as allotted to man by nature, on this earth, and no more. Some
members earnestly endeavour to realize and, so to speak, to objectivize
Theosophy in their lives; while others desire only to know of, not to
practise it; and others still may have joined the Society merely out
of curiosity, or a passing interest, or perhaps, again, because some
of their friends belong to it. How, then, can the system be judged by
the standard of those who would assume the name without any right to
it? Is poetry or its muse to be measured only by those would-be poets
who afflict our ears? The Society can be regarded as the embodiment
of Theosophy only in its abstract motives; it can never presume to
call itself its concrete vehicle so long as human imperfections and
weaknesses are all represented in its body; otherwise the Society would
be only repeating the great error and the outflowing sacrileges of the
so-called Churches of Christ. If Eastern comparisons may be permitted,
Theosophy is the shoreless ocean of universal truth, love, and wisdom,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
reflecting its radiance on the earth, while the Theosophical Society is
only a visible bubble on that reflection. Theosophy is divine nature,
visible and invisible, and its Society human nature trying to ascend
to its divine parent. Theosophy, finally, is the fixed eternal sun,
and its Society the evanescent comet trying to settle in an orbit to
become a planet, ever revolving within the attraction of the sun of
truth. It was formed to assist in showing to men that such a thing as
Theosophy exists, and to help them to ascend towards it by studying and
assimilating its eternal verities.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I thought you said you had no tenets
or doctrines of your own?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No more we have. The Society has
no wisdom of its own to support or teach. It is simply the storehouse
of all the truths uttered by the great seers, initiates, and prophets
of historic and even pre-historic ages; at least, as many as it can
get. Therefore, it is merely the channel through which more or less
of truth, found in the accumulated utterances of humanity’s great
teachers, is poured out into the world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is such truth unreachable
outside of the Society? Does not every Church claim the same?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all. The undeniable
existence of great initiates—true “Sons of God”—shows that such wisdom
was often reached by isolated individuals, never, however, without the
guidance of a master at first. But most of the followers of such, when
they became masters in their turn, have dwarfed the catholicism of
these teachings into the narrow groove of their own sectarian dogmas.
The commandments of <i>a</i> chosen master alone were then adopted and
followed, to the exclusion of all others—if followed at all, note well,
as in the case of the Sermon on the Mount. Each religion is thus a bit
of the divine truth, made to focus a vast panorama of human fancy which
claimed to represent and replace that truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But Theosophy, you say, is not a religion?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most assuredly it is not, since
it is the essence of all religion and of absolute truth, a drop of
which only underlies every creed. To resort once more to metaphor.
Theosophy, on earth, is like the white ray of the spectrum, and
every religion only one of the seven prismatic colours. Ignoring all
the others, and cursing them as false, every special coloured ray
claims not only priority, but to be <i>that white ray</i> itself, and
anathematizes even its own tints from light to dark, as heresies.
Yet, as the sun of truth rises higher and higher on the horizon of
man’s perception, and each coloured ray gradually fades out until it
is finally reabsorbed in its turn, humanity will at last be cursed no
longer with artificial polarizations, but will find itself bathing
in the pure colourless sunlight of eternal truth. And this will be
<i>Theosophia</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Your claim is, then, that all
the great religions are derived from Theosophy, and that it is by
assimilating it that the world will be finally saved from the curse of
its great illusions and errors?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Precisely so. And we add that our
Theosophical Society is the humble seed which, if watered and left to
live, will finally produce the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil which
is grafted on the Tree of Life Eternal. For it is only by studying the
various great religions and philosophies of humanity, by comparing them
dispassionately and with an unbiased mind, that men can hope to arrive
at the truth. It is especially by finding out and noting their various
points of agreement that we may achieve this result. For no sooner do
we arrive—either by study, or by being taught by someone who knows—at
their inner meaning, than we find, almost in every case, that it
expresses some great truth in Nature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> We have heard of a Golden Age that
was, and what you describe would be a Golden Age to be realised at some
future day. When shall it be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not before humanity, as a whole,
feels the need of it. A maxim in the Persian “Javidan Khirad” says:
“Truth is of two kinds—one manifest and self-evident; the other
demanding incessantly new demonstrations and proofs.” It is only when
this latter kind of truth becomes as universally obvious as it is now
dim, and therefore liable to be distorted by sophistry and casuistry;
it is only when the two kinds will have become once more one, that all
people will be brought to see alike.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely those few who have felt
the need of such truths must have made up their minds to believe in
something definite? You tell me that, the Society having no doctrines
of its own, every member may believe as he chooses and accept what
he pleases. This looks as if the Theosophical Society was bent upon
reviving the confusion of languages and beliefs of the Tower of Babel
of old. Have you no beliefs in common?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What is meant by the Society having
no tenets or doctrines of its own is, that no special doctrines or
beliefs are <i>obligatory</i> on its members; but, of course, this applies
only to the body as a whole. The Society, as you were told, is divided
into an outer and an inner body. Those who belong to the latter have,
of course, a philosophy, or—if you so prefer it— a religious system of
their own.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> May we be told what it is?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We make no secret of it. It was
outlined a few years ago in the <i>Theosophist</i> and “Esoteric Buddhism,”
and may be found still more elaborated in the “Secret Doctrine.” It is
based on the oldest philosophy in the world, called the Wisdom-Religion
or the Archaic Doctrine. If you like, you may ask questions and have
them explained.

<h2>V. <br>THE FUNDAMENTAL TEACHINGS OF THEOSOPHY.</h2></div>
<h3>ON GOD AND PRAYER.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you believe in God?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That depends what you mean by the
term.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I mean the God of the Christians,
the Father of Jesus, and the Creator: the Biblical God of Moses, in
short.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In such a God we do not believe. We
reject the idea of a personal, or an extra-cosmic and anthropomorphic
God, who is but the gigantic shadow of <i>man</i>, and not of man at his
best, either. The God of theology, we say—and prove it—is a bundle of
contradictions and a logical impossibility. Therefore, we will have
nothing to do with him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> State your reasons, if you
please.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are many, and cannot all
receive attention. But here are a few. This God is called by his
devotees infinite and absolute, is he not?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I believe he is.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then, if infinite—<i>i.e.</i>,
limitless—and especially if absolute, how can he have a form, and be a
creator of anything? Form implies limitation, and a beginning as well
as an end; and, in order to create, a Being must think and plan. How
can the ABSOLUTE be supposed to think—<i>i.e.</i>, to have any relation
whatever to that which is limited, finite, and conditioned? This is a
philosophical and a logical absurdity. Even the Hebrew Kabala rejects
such an idea, and therefore makes of the one and the Absolute Deific
Principle an infinite Unity called Ain-Soph.<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14_14">[14]</a>
In order to create, the Creator has to become active; and as this
is impossible for ABSOLUTENESS, the infinite principle had to be
shown becoming the cause of evolution (not creation) in an indirect
way—<i>i.e.</i>, through the emanation from itself (another absurdity, due
this time to the translators of the Kabala)<a id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15_15">[15]</a>
of the Sephiroth.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How about those Kabalists, who,
while being such, still believe in Jehovah, or the <i>Tetragrammaton</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are at liberty to believe in
what they please, as their belief or disbelief can hardly affect a
self-evident fact. The Jesuits tell us that two and two are not always
four to a certainty, since it depends on the will of God to make 2 x 2
= 5. Shall we accept their sophistry for all that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then you are Atheists?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not that we know of, and not unless
the epithet of “Atheist” is to be applied to those who disbelieve in an
anthropomorphic God. We believe in a Universal Divine Principle, the
root of ALL, from which all proceeds, and within which all shall be
absorbed at the end of the great cycle of Being.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This is the old, old claim of
Pantheism. If you are Pantheists, you cannot be Deists; and if you are
not Deists, then you have to answer to the name of Atheists.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not necessarily so. The term
“Pantheism” is again one of the many abused terms, whose real and
primitive meaning has been distorted by blind prejudice and a one-sided
view of it. If you accept the Christian etymology of this compound
word, and form it of <b>παν</b>, “all,” and <b>θεος</b>, “god,” and
then imagine and teach that this means that every stone and every
tree in Nature is a God or the ONE God, then, of course, you will be
right, and make of Pantheists fetish-worshippers, in addition to their
legitimate name. But you will hardly be as successful if you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
etymologise the word Pantheism esoterically, and as we do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is, then your definition of it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Let me ask you a question in my
turn. What do you understand by Pan or Nature?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Nature is, I suppose, the sum total
of things existing around us; the aggregate of causes and effects in
the world of matter, the creation or universe.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Hence the personified sum and
order of known causes and effects; the total of all finite agencies
and forces, as utterly disconnected from an intelligent Creator or
Creators, and perhaps “conceived of as a single and separate force”—as
in your cyclopædias?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yes, I believe so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Well, we neither take into
consideration this objective and material nature, which we call an
evanescent illusion, nor do we mean by <b>παν</b> Nature, in the sense
of its accepted derivation from the Latin <i>Natura</i> (becoming, from
<i>nasci</i>, to be born). When we speak of the Deity and make it identical,
hence coeval, with Nature, the eternal and uncreate nature is meant,
and not your aggregate of flitting shadows and finite unrealities. We
leave it to the hymn-makers to call the visible sky or heaven, God’s
Throne, and our earth of mud His footstool. Our DEITY is neither in
a paradise, nor in a particular tree, building, or mountain; it is
everywhere, in every atom of the visible as of the invisible Cosmos,
in, over, and around every invisible atom and divisible molecule;
for IT is the mysterious power of evolution and involution, the
omnipresent, omnipotent, and even omniscient creative potentiality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Stop! Omniscience is the prerogative
of something that thinks, and you deny to your Absoluteness the power
of thought.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We deny it to the ABSOLUTE, since
thought is something limited and conditioned. But you evidently
forget that in philosophy absolute unconsciousness is also absolute
consciousness, as otherwise it would not be <i>absolute</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then your Absolute thinks?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No, IT does not; for the simple
reason that it is <i>Absolute Thought</i> itself. Nor does it exist, for
the same reason, as it is absolute existence, and <i>Be-ness</i>, not a
Being. Read the superb Kabalistic poem by Solomon Ben Jehudah Gabirol,
in the Kether-Malchut, and you will understand:—“Thou art one, the
root of all numbers, but not as an element of numeration; for unity
admits not of multiplication, change, or form. Thou art one, and in the
secret of Thy unity the wisest of men are lost, because they know it
not. Thou art one, and Thy unity is never diminished, never extended,
and cannot be changed. Thou art one, and no thought of mine can fix
for Thee a limit, or define Thee. Thou ART, but not as one existent,
for the understanding and vision of mortals cannot attain to Thy
existence, nor determine for Thee the where, the how and the why,”
etc., etc. In short, our Deity is the eternal, incessantly <i>evolving</i>,
not <i>creating</i>, builder of the universe; that <i>universe itself
unfolding</i> out of its own essence, not being <i>made</i>. It is a sphere,
without circumference, in its symbolism, which has but one ever-acting
attribute embracing all other existing or thinkable attributes—ITSELF.
It is the one law, giving the impulse to manifested, eternal, and
immutable laws, within that never-manifesting, <i>because</i> absolute LAW,
which in its manifesting periods is <i>The ever-Becoming</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I once heard one of your members
remarking that Universal Deity, being everywhere, was in vessels of
dishonour, as in those of honour, and, therefore, was present in every
atom of my cigar ash! Is this not rank blasphemy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I do not think so, as simple logic
can hardly be regarded as blasphemy. Were we to exclude the Omnipresent
Principle from one single mathematical point of the universe, or from
a particle of matter occupying any conceivable space, could we still
regard it as infinite?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_5_2"></a>IS IT NECESSARY TO PRAY?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq</span>. Do you believe in prayer, and do you
ever pray?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo</span>. We do not. We <i>act</i>, instead of
<i>talking</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You do not offer prayers even to the
Absolute Principle?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Why should we? Being well-occupied
people, we can hardly afford to lose time in addressing verbal
prayers to a pure abstraction. The Unknowable is capable of relations
only in its parts to each other, but is non-existent as regards any
finite relations. The visible universe depends for its existence and
phenomena on its mutually acting forms and their laws, not on prayer or
prayers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you not believe at all in the
efficacy of prayer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not in prayer taught in so many
words and repeated externally, if by prayer you mean the outward
petition to an unknown God as the addressee, which was inaugurated by
the Jews and popularised by the Pharisees.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is there any other kind of
prayer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most decidedly; we call it
WILL-PRAYER, and it is rather an internal command than a petition.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> To whom, then, do you pray when you
do so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To “our Father in heaven”—in its
esoteric meaning.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq</span>. Is that different from the one given
to it in theology?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Entirely so. An Occultist or a
Theosophist addresses his prayer to <i>his Father which is in secret</i>
(read, and try to understand, ch. vi. v. 6, Matthew), not to an
extra-cosmic and therefore finite God; and that “Father” is in man
himself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then you make of man a God?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Please say “God” and not <i>a</i> God.
In our sense, the inner man is the only God we can have cognizance
of. And how can this be otherwise? Grant us our postulate that God
is a universally diffused, infinite principle, and how can man alone
escape from being soaked through <i>by</i>, and <i>in</i>, the Deity? We call our
“Father in heaven” that deific essence of which we are cognizant within
us, in our heart and spiritual consciousness, and which has nothing
to do with the anthropomorphic conception we may form of it in our
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
physical brain or its fancy: “Know ye not that ye are the temple of
God, and that the great spirit of that the spirit of (the absolute) God
dwelleth in you?”<a id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16_16">[16]</a>
Yet, let no man anthropomorphise that essence in us. Let no
Theosophist, if he would hold to divine, not human truth, say that
this “God in secret” listens to, or is distinct from, either finite
man or the infinite essence—for all are one. Nor, as just remarked,
that a prayer is a petition. It is a mystery rather; an occult
process by which finite and conditioned thoughts and desires, unable
to be assimilated by the absolute spirit which is unconditioned, are
translated into spiritual wills and the will; such process being called
“spiritual transmutation.” The intensity of our ardent aspirations
changes prayer into the “philosopher’s stone,” or that which transmutes
lead into pure gold. The only homogeneous essence, our “will-power”
becomes the active or creative force, producing effects according to
our desire.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you mean to say that prayer is an
occult process bringing about physical results?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I do. <i>Will-Power</i> becomes a living
power. But woe unto those Occultists and Theosophists, who, instead
of crushing out the desires of the lower personal <i>ego</i> or physical
man, and saying, addressing their <i>Higher</i> Spiritual Ego immersed
in Atma-Buddhic light, “Thy will be done, not mine,” etc., send up
waves of will-power for selfish or unholy purposes! For this is black
magic, abomination, and spiritual sorcery. Unfortunately, all this
is the favorite occupation of our Christian statesmen and generals,
especially when the latter are sending two armies to murder each other.
Both indulge before action in a bit of such sorcery, by offering
respectively prayers to the same God of Hosts, each entreating his help
to cut its enemies’ throats.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> David prayed to the Lord of Hosts to
help him smite the Philistines and slay the Syrians and the Moabites,
and “the Lord preserved David whithersoever he went.” In that we only
follow what we find in the Bible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Of course you do. But since you
delight in calling yourselves Christians, not Israelites or Jews, as
far as we know, why do you not rather follow that which Christ says?
And he distinctly commands you not to follow “them of old times,” or
the Mosaic law, but bids you do as he tells you, and warns those who
would kill by the sword, that they, too, will perish by the sword.
Christ has given you one prayer of which you have made a lip prayer
and a boast, and which none but the <i>true</i> Occultist understands. In
it you say, in your dead-sense meaning: “Forgive us our debts, as we
forgive our debtors,” which you never do. Again, he told you to <i>love
your enemies</i> and do <i>good to them that hate you</i>. It is surely not
the “meek prophet of Nazareth” who taught you to pray to your “Father”
to slay, and give you victory over your enemies! This is why we reject
what you call “prayers.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how do you explain the universal
fact that all nations and peoples have prayed to, and worshipped a God
or Gods? Some have adored and propitiated <i>devils</i> and harmful spirits,
but this only proves the universality of the belief in the efficacy of
prayer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is explained by that other fact
that prayer has several other meanings besides that given it by the
Christians. It means not only a pleading or <i>petition</i>, but meant, in
days of old, far more an invocation and incantation. The <i>mantra</i>, or
the rhythmically chanted prayer of the Hindus, has precisely such a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
meaning, as the Brahmins hold themselves higher than the common <i>devas</i>
or “Gods.” A prayer may be an appeal or an incantation for malediction,
and a curse (as in the case of two armies praying simultaneously for
mutual destruction) as much as for blessing. And as the great majority
of people are intensely selfish, and pray only for themselves, asking
to be <i>given</i> their “daily bread” instead of working for it, and
begging God not to lead them “into temptation” but to deliver them
(the memoralists only) from evil, the result is, that prayer, as now
understood, is doubly pernicious: (<i>a</i>) It kills in man self-reliance;
(<i>b</i>) It develops in him a still more ferocious selfishness and egotism
than he is already endowed with by nature. I repeat, that we believe
in “communion” and simultaneous action in unison with our “Father in
secret”; and in rare moments of ecstatic bliss, in the mingling of our
higher soul with the universal essence, attracted as it is towards its
origin and centre, a state, called during life <i>Samadhi</i>, and after
death, <i>Nirvana</i>. We refuse to pray to <i>created</i> finite beings—<i>i.e.</i>,
gods, saints, angels, etc., because we regard it as idolatry. We cannot
pray to the ABSOLUTE for reasons explained before; therefore, we try to
replace fruitless and useless prayer by meritorious and good-producing actions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Christians would call it pride and
blasphemy. Are they wrong?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Entirely so. It is they, on the
contrary, who show Satanic pride in their belief that the Absolute or
the Infinite, even if there was such a thing as the possibility of any
relation between the unconditioned and the conditioned—will stoop to
listen to every foolish or egotistical prayer. And it is they again,
who virtually blaspheme, in teaching that an Omniscient and Omnipotent
God needs uttered prayers to know what he has to do! This—understood
esoterically—is corroborated by both Buddha and Jesus. The one says
“seek nought from the helpless Gods—pray not! <i>but rather act</i>; for
darkness will not brighten. Ask nought from silence, for it can neither
speak nor hear.” And the other—Jesus—recommends: “Whatsoever ye shall
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
ask in my name (that of Christos) that will I do.” Of course,
this quotation, if taken in its <i>literal</i> sense, goes against our
argument. But if we accept it esoterically, with the full knowledge
of the meaning of the term, “Christos,” which to us represents
<i>Atma-Buddhi-Manas</i>, the “SELF,” it comes to this: the only God we must
recognise and pray to, or rather act in unison with, is that spirit of
God of which our body is the temple, and in which it dwelleth.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_5_3"></a>PRAYER KILLS SELF RELIANCE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But did not Christ himself pray and
recommend prayer?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is so recorded, but those
“prayers” are precisely of that kind of communion just mentioned with
one’s “Father in secret.” Otherwise, and if we identify Jesus with the
universal deity, there would be something too absurdly illogical in
the inevitable conclusion that he, the “very God himself” <i>prayed to
himself</i>, and separated the will of that God from his own!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> One argument more; an argument,
moreover, much used by some Christians. They say, “I feel that I am not
able to conquer any passions and weaknesses in my own strength. But
when I pray to Jesus Christ I feel that he gives me strength and that
in his power I am able to conquer.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No wonder. If “Christ Jesus” is
God, and one independent and separate from him who prays, of course
everything is, and <i>must</i> be possible to “a mighty God.” But, then,
where’s the merit, or justice either, of such a conquest? Why should
the pseudo-conqueror be rewarded for something done which has cost him
only prayers? Would you, even a simple mortal man, pay your labourer a
full day’s wage if you did most of his work for him, he sitting under
an apple tree, and praying to you to do so, all the while? This idea of
passing one’s whole life in moral idleness, and having one’s hardest
work and duty done by another—whether God or man—is most revolting to
us, as it is most degrading to human dignity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Perhaps so, yet it is the idea of
trusting in a personal Saviour to help and strengthen in the battle of
life, which is the fundamental idea of modern Christianity. And there
is no doubt that, subjectively, such belief is efficacious, <i>i.e.</i>,
that those who believe <i>do</i> feel themselves helped and strengthened.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Nor is there any more doubt, that
some patients of “Christian” and “Mental Scientists”—the great
“<i>Deniers</i>”<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17_17">[17]</a>
—are also sometimes cured; nor that hypnotism, and suggestion,
psychology, and even mediumship, will produce such results, as often,
if not oftener. You take into consideration, and string on the thread
of your argument, successes alone. And how about ten times the number
of failures? Surely you will not presume to say that failure is unknown
even with a sufficiency of blind faith, among fanatical Christians?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how can you explain those cases
which are followed by full success? Where does a Theosophist look to
for power to subdue his passions and selfishness?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To his Higher Self, the divine
spirit, or the God in him, and to his <i>Karma</i>. How long shall we have
to repeat over and over again that the tree is known by its fruit, the
nature of the cause by its effects? You speak of subduing passions,
and becoming good through and with the help of God or Christ. We ask,
where do you find more virtuous, guiltless people, abstaining from
sin and crime, in Christendom or Buddhism—in Christian countries
or in heathen lands? Statistics are there to give the answer and
corroborate our claims. According to the last census in Ceylon and
India, in the comparative table of crimes committed by Christians,
Mussulmen, Hindoos, Eurasians, Buddhists, etc., etc., on two millions
of population taken at random from each, and covering the misdemeanours
of several years, the proportion of crimes committed by the Christian
stands as 15 to 4 as against those committed by the Buddhist
population. (Vide <span class="smcap">Lucifer</span> for April, 1888, p. 147, Art.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Christian Lectures on Buddhism.) No Orientalist, no historian of any
note, or traveller in Buddhist land, from Bishop Bigandet and Abbé Huc,
to Sir William Hunter and every fair-minded official, will fail to
give the palm of virtue to Buddhists before Christians. Yet the former
(not the true Buddhist Siamese sect, at all events) do not believe in
either God or a future reward, outside of this earth. They do not pray,
neither priests nor laymen. “Pray!” they would exclaim in wonder, “to
whom, or what?”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then they are truly Atheists.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most undeniably, but they are
also the most virtue-loving and virtue-keeping men in the whole
world. Buddhism says: Respect the religions of other men and remain
true to your own; but Church Christianity, denouncing all the gods of
other nations as devils, would doom every <i>non</i>-Christian to eternal
perdition.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Does not the Buddhist priesthood do
the same?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Never. They hold too much to the
wise precept found in the <span class="smcap">Dhammapada</span> to do
so, for they know that, “If any man, whether he be learned or not,
consider himself so great as to despise other men, he is like a blind
man holding a candle—blind himself, he illumines others.”</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_5_4"></a>ON THE SOURCE OF THE HUMAN SOUL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How, then, do you account for man
being endowed with a Spirit and Soul? Whence these?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> From the Universal Soul. Certainly
not bestowed by a <i>personal</i> God. Whence the moist element in the
jelly-fish? From the Ocean which surrounds it, in which it lives and
breathes and has its being, and whither it returns when dissolved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> So you reject the teaching that Soul
is given, or breathed into man, by God?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We are obliged to. The “Soul”
spoken of in ch. ii. of Genesis (v. 7) is, as therein stated, the
“living Soul” or <i>Nephesh</i> (the <i>vital</i>, animal soul) with which God
(we say “nature” and <i>immutable law</i>) endows man like every animal, is
not at all the thinking Soul or mind; least of all is it the <i>immortal Spirit</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Well, let us put it otherwise: is it
God who endows man with a human <i>rational</i> Soul and immortal Spirit?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Again, in the way you put the
question, we must object to it. Since we believe in no <i>personal</i> God,
how can we believe that he endows man with anything? But granting,
for the sake of argument, a God who takes upon himself the risk of
creating a new Soul for every new-born baby, all that can be said is
that such a God can hardly be regarded as himself endowed with any
wisdom or prevision. Certain other difficulties and the impossibility
of reconciling this with the claims made for the mercy, justice, equity
and omniscience of that God, are so many deadly reefs on which this
theological dogma is daily and hourly broken.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean? What
difficulties?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I am thinking of an unanswerable
argument offered once in my presence by a Cingalese Buddhist priest,
a famous preacher, to a Christian missionary—one in no way ignorant
or unprepared for the public discussion during which it was advanced.
It was near Colombo, and the Missionary had challenged the priest
Megattivati to give his reasons why the Christian God should not be
accepted by the “heathen.” Well, the Missionary came out of that for
ever memorable discussion second best, as usual.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I should be glad to learn in what way.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply this: the Buddhist priest
premised by asking the <i>padri</i> whether his God had given commandments
to Moses only for men to keep, but to be broken by God himself. The
missionary denied the supposition indignantly. Well, said his opponent,
“you tell us that God makes no exceptions to this rule, and that no
Soul can be born without his will. Now God forbids adultery, among
other things, and yet you say in the same breath that it is he who
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
creates every baby born, and he who endows it with a Soul. Are we then
to understand that the millions of children born in crime and adultery
are your God’s work? That your God forbids and punishes the breaking of
his laws; and that, nevertheless, <i>he creates daily and hourly souls
for just such children</i>? According to the simplest logic, your God is
an accomplice in the crime; since, but for his help and interference,
no such children of lust could be born. Where is the justice of
punishing not only the guilty parents but even the innocent babe for
that which is done by that very God, whom yet you exonerate from any
guilt himself?” The missionary looked at his watch and suddenly found
it was getting too late for further discussion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You forget that all such
inexplicable cases are mysteries, and that we are forbidden by our
religion to pry into the mysteries of God.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No, we do not forget, but simply
reject such impossibilities. Nor do we want you to believe as we do. We
only answer the questions you ask. We have, however, another name for
your “mysteries.”</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_5_5"></a>THE BUDDHIST TEACHINGS ON THE ABOVE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What does Buddhism teach with regard
to the Soul?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It depends whether you mean
exoteric, popular Buddhism, or its esoteric teachings. The former
explains itself in the <i>Buddhist Catechism</i> in this wise: “Soul it
considers a word used by the ignorant to express a false idea. If
everything is subject to change, then man is included, and every
material part of him must change. That which is subject to change is
not permanent, so there can be no immortal survival of a changeful
thing.” This seems plain and definite. But when we come to the question
that the new personality in each succeeding re-birth is the aggregate
of “<i>Skandhas</i>,” or the attributes, of the <i>old</i> personality, and ask
whether this new aggregation of <i>Skandhas</i> is a <i>new</i> being likewise,
in which nothing has remained of the last, we read that: “In one sense
it is a new being, in another it is not. During this life the Skandhas
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
are continually changing, while the man A. B. of forty is identical
as regards personality with the youth A. B. of eighteen, yet by the
continual waste and reparation of his body and change of mind and
character, he is a different being. Nevertheless, the man in his old
age justly reaps the reward or suffering consequent upon his thoughts
and actions at every previous stage of his life. So the new being of
the re-birth, being the <i>same individuality as before</i> (but not the
same personality), with but a changed form, or new aggregation of
<i>Skandhas</i>, justly reaps the consequences of his actions and thoughts
in the previous existence.” This is abstruse metaphysics, and plainly
does not express <i>disbelief</i> in Soul by any means.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is not something like this spoken
of in <i>Esoteric Buddhism</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is, for this teaching belongs
both to Esoteric <i>Budhism</i> or Secret Wisdom, and to the exoteric
Buddhism, or the religious philosophy of Gautama Buddha.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But we are distinctly told that most
of the Buddhists do not believe in the Soul’s immortality?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No more do we, if you mean by
Soul the <i>personal Ego</i>, or life-Soul—<i>Nephesh</i>. But every learned
Buddhist believes in the individual or <i>divine Ego</i>. Those who do not,
err in their judgment. They are as mistaken on this point, as those
Christians who mistake the theological interpolations of the later
editors of the Gospels about damnation and hell-fire, for <i>verbatim</i>
utterances of Jesus. Neither Buddha nor “Christ” ever wrote anything
themselves, but both spoke in allegories and used “dark sayings,” as
all true Initiates did, and will do for a long time yet to come. Both
Scriptures treat of all such metaphysical questions very cautiously,
and both, Buddhist and Christian records, sin by that excess of
exotericism; the dead letter meaning far overshooting the mark in both cases.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you mean to suggest that
neither the teachings of Buddha nor those of Christ have been
heretofore rightly understood?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What I mean is just as you say.
Both Gospels, the Buddhist and the Christian, were preached with the
same object in view. Both reformers were ardent philanthropists and
practical <i>altruists—preaching most unmistakably Socialism</i> of the
noblest and highest type, self-sacrifice to the bitter end. “Let the
sins of the whole world fall upon me that I may relieve man’s misery
and suffering!” cries Buddha; ... “I would not let one cry whom I
could save!” exclaims the Prince-beggar, clad in the refuse rags of
the burial-grounds. “Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy
laden and I will give you rest,” is the appeal to the poor and the
disinherited made by the “Man of Sorrows,” who hath not where to lay
his head. The teachings of both are boundless love for humanity,
charity, forgiveness of injury, forgetfulness of self, and pity for
the deluded masses; both show the same contempt for riches, and make
no difference between <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>. Their desire was, without
revealing to <i>all</i> the sacred mysteries of initiation, to give the
ignorant and the misled, whose burden in life was too heavy for them,
hope enough and an inkling into the truth sufficient to support them in
their heaviest hours. But the object of both Reformers was frustrated,
owing to excess of zeal of their later followers. The words of the
Masters having been misunderstood and misinterpreted, behold the
consequences!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely Buddha must have
repudiated the soul’s immortality, if all the Orientalists and his own
Priests say so!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The Arhats began by following the
policy of their Master and the majority of the subsequent priests were
not initiated, just as in Christianity; and so, little by little, the
great esoteric truths became almost lost. A proof in point is, that,
out of the two existing sects in Ceylon, the Siamese believes death to
be the absolute annihilation of individuality and personality, and the
other explains Nirvana, as we theosophists do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why, in that case, do Buddhism
and Christianity represent the two opposite poles of such belief?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because the conditions under which
they were preached were not the same. In India the Brahmins, jealous of
their superior knowledge, and excluding from it every caste save their
own, had driven millions of men into idolatry and almost fetishism.
Buddha had to give the death-blow to an exuberance of unhealthy fancy
and fanatical superstition resulting from ignorance, such as has rarely
been known before or after. Better a philosophical atheism than such
ignorant worship for those—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Who cry upon their gods and are not heard,</span>
<span class="i0">Or are not heeded—”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="no-indent"> and who live and die in mental despair. He had
to arrest first of all this muddy torrent of superstition, to uproot
<i>errors</i> before he gave out the truth. And as he could not give out
<i>all</i>, for the same good reason as Jesus, who reminds <i>his</i> disciples
that the Mysteries of Heaven are not for the unintelligent masses,
but for the elect alone, and therefore “spake he to them in parables”
(Matt. xiii. 11)—so his caution led Buddha <i>to conceal too much</i>. He
even refused to say to the monk Vacchagotta whether there was, or was
not an Ego in man. When pressed to answer, “the Exalted one maintained
silence.”<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18_18">[18]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This refers to Gautama, but in what
way does it touch the Gospels?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Read history and think over it.
At the time the events narrated in the Gospels are alleged to have
happened, there was a similar intellectual fermentation taking place
in the whole civilized world, only with opposite results in the East
and the West. The old gods were dying out. While the civilized classes
drifted in the train of the unbelieving Sadducees into materialistic
negations and mere dead-letter Mosaic form in Palestine, and into moral
dissolution in Rome, the lowest and poorer classes ran after sorcery
and strange gods, or became hypocrites and pharisees. Once more the
time for a spiritual reform had arrived. The cruel, anthropomorphic and
jealous God of the Jews, with his sanguinary laws of “an eye for eye
and tooth for tooth,” of the shedding of blood and animal sacrifice,
had to be relegated to a secondary place and replaced by the merciful
“Father in Secret.” The latter had to be shown, not as an extra-Cosmic
God, but as a divine Saviour of the man of flesh, enshrined in his
own heart and soul, in the poor as in the rich. No more here than in
India, could the secrets of initiation be divulged, lest by giving that
which is holy to the dogs, and casting pearls before swine, both the
<i>Revealer</i> and the things revealed should be trodden under foot. Thus,
the reticence of both Buddha and Jesus—whether the latter lived out
the historic period allotted to him or not, and who equally abstained
from revealing plainly the Mysteries of Life and Death—led in the one
case to the blank negations of Southern Buddhism, and in the other, to
the three clashing forms of the Christian Church and the 300 sects in
Protestant England alone.

<h2>VI. <br>THEOSOPHICAL TEACHINGS AS TO NATURE AND MAN.</h2></div>
<h3>THE UNITY OF ALL IN ALL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Having told me what God, the Soul
and Man are <i>not</i>, in your views, can you inform me what they <i>are</i>,
according to your teachings?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In their origin and in eternity the
three, like the universe and all therein, are one with the absolute
Unity, the unknowable deific essence I spoke about sometime back.
We believe in no <i>creation</i>, but in the periodical and consecutive
appearances of the universe from the subjective on to the objective
plane of being, at regular intervals of time, covering periods of
immense duration.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you elaborate the subject?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Take as a first comparison and
a help towards a more correct conception, the solar year, and as a
second, the two halves of that year, producing each a day and a night
of six months’ duration at the North Pole. Now imagine, if you can,
instead of a Solar year of 365 days, ETERNITY. Let the sun represent
the universe, and the polar days and nights of 6 months each—<i>days and
nights lasting each 182 trillions and quadrillions of years</i>, instead
of 182 days each. As the sun arises every morning on our <i>objective</i>
horizon out of its (to us) <i>subjective</i> and antipodal space, so does
the Universe emerge periodically on the plane of objectivity, issuing
from that of subjectivity—the antipodes of the former. This is the
“Cycle of Life.” And as the sun disappears from our horizon, so
does the Universe disappear at regular periods, when the “Universal
night” sets in. The Hindoos call such alternations the “Days and
Nights of Brahma,” or the time of <i>Manvantara</i> and that of <i>Pralaya</i>
(dissolution). The Westerns may call them Universal Days and Nights if
they prefer. During the latter (the nights) <i>All is in All</i>; every atom
is resolved into one Homogeneity.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_6_2"></a>EVOLUTION AND ILLUSION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But who is it that creates each time
the Universe?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No one creates it. Science would
call the process evolution; the pre-Christian philosophers and the
Orientalists called it emanation: we, Occultists and Theosophists, see
in it the only universal and eternal <i>reality</i> casting a periodical
reflection of <i>itself</i> on the infinite Spatial depths. This reflection,
which you regard as the objective <i>material</i> universe, we consider as a
temporary <i>illusion</i> and nothing else. That alone which is eternal is
<i>real</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> At that rate, you and I are also
illusions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As flitting personalities, to-day
one person, to-morrow another—we are. Would you call the sudden flashes
of the <i>Aurora borealis</i>, the Northern lights, a “reality,” though it
is as real as can be while you look at it? Certainly not; it is the
cause that produces it, if permanent and eternal, which is the only
reality, while the other is but a passing illusion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> All this does not explain to me how
this illusion called the universe originates; how the conscious <i>to
be</i>, proceeds to manifest itself from the unconsciousness that <i>is</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is <i>unconsciousness</i> only to
our finite consciousness. Verily may we paraphrase verse v, in the
1st chapter of St. John, and say “and (Absolute) light (which is
darkness) shineth in darkness (which is illusionary material light);
and the darkness comprehendeth it not.” This absolute light is also
absolute and immutable law. Whether by radiation or emanation—we need
not quarrel over terms—the universe passes out of its homogeneous
subjectivity on to the first plane of manifestation, of which planes
there are seven, we are taught. With each plane it becomes more dense
and material until it reaches this, our plane, on which the only world
approximately known and understood in its physical composition by
Science, is the planetary or Solar system—one <i>sui generis</i>, we are told.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean by <i>sui generis</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I mean that, though the fundamental
law and the universal working of laws of Nature are uniform, still our
Solar system (like every other such system in the millions of others
in Cosmos) and even our Earth, has its own programme of manifestations
differing from the respective programmes of all others. We speak of
the inhabitants of other planets and imagine that if they are <i>men</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, thinking entities, they must be as we are. The fancy of poets
and painters and sculptors never fails to represent even the angels as
a beautiful copy of man—<i>plus</i> wings. We say that all this is an error
and a delusion; because, if on this little earth alone one finds such
a diversity in its flora, fauna and mankind—from the seaweed to the
cedar of Lebanon, from the jelly-fish to the elephant, from the Bushman
and negro to the Apollo Belvedere—alter the conditions cosmic and
planetary, and there must be as a result quite a different flora, fauna
and mankind. The same laws will fashion quite a different set of things
and beings even on this our plane, including in it all our planets.
How much more different then must be <i>external</i> nature in other Solar
systems, and how foolish is it to judge of other <i>stars</i> and worlds and
human beings by our own, as physical science does!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what are your data for this
assertion?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What science in general will never
accept as proof—the cumulative testimony of an endless series of
Seers who have testified to this fact. Their spiritual visions, real
explorations by, and through, physical and spiritual senses untrammeled
by blind flesh, were systematically checked and compared one with
the other, and their nature sifted. All that was not corroborated by
unanimous and collective experience was rejected, while that only was
recorded as established truth which, in various ages, under different
climes, and throughout an untold series of incessant observations,
was found to agree and receive constantly further corroboration. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
methods used by our scholars and students of the psycho-spiritual
sciences do not differ from those of students of the natural and
physical sciences, as you may see. Only our fields of research are
on two different planes, and our instruments are made by no human
hands, for which reason perchance they are only the more reliable. The
retorts, accumulators, and microscopes of the chemist and naturalist
may get out of order; the telescope and the astronomer’s horological
instruments may get spoiled; our recording instruments are beyond the
influence of weather or the elements.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And therefore you have implicit
faith in them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Faith is a word not to be found
in theosophical dictionaries: we say <i>knowledge based on observation
and experience</i>. There is this difference, however, that while the
observation and experience of physical science lead the Scientists to
about as many “working” hypotheses as there are minds to evolve them,
our <i>knowledge</i> consents to add to its lore only those facts which have
become undeniable, and which are fully and absolutely demonstrated. We
have no two beliefs or hypotheses on the same subject.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is it on such data that you came to
accept the strange theories we find in <i>Esoteric Buddhism</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just so. These theories may be
slightly incorrect in their minor details, and even faulty in their
exposition by lay students; they are <i>facts</i> in nature, nevertheless,
and come nearer the truth than any scientific hypothesis.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_6_3"></a>ON THE SEPTENARY CONSTITUTION OF OUR PLANET.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I understand that you describe our
earth as forming part of a chain of earths?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We do. But the other six “earths”
or globes, are not on the same plane of objectivity as our earth is;
therefore we cannot see them.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is that on account of the great
distance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all, for we see with our
naked eye planets and even stars at immeasurably greater distances;
but it is owing to those six globes being outside our physical means
of perception, or plane of being. It is not only that their material
density, weight, or fabric are entirely different from those of our
earth and the other known planets; but they are (to us) on an entirely
different <i>layer</i> of space, so to speak; a layer not to be perceived
or felt by our physical senses. And when I say “layer,” please do
not allow your fancy to suggest to you layers like strata or beds
laid one over the other, for this would only lead to another absurd
misconception. What I mean by “layer” is that plane of infinite
space which by its nature cannot fall under our ordinary waking
perceptions, whether mental or physical; but which exists in nature
outside of our normal mentality or consciousness, outside of our three
dimensional space, and outside of our division of time. Each of the
seven fundamental planes (or layers) in space—of course as a whole,
as the pure space of Locke’s definition, not as our finite space—has
its own objectivity and subjectivity, its own space and time, its
own consciousness and set of senses. But all this will be hardly
comprehensible to one trained in the modern ways of thought.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean by a different set
of senses? Is there anything on our human plane that you could bring
as an illustration of what you say, just to give a clearer idea of
what you may mean by this variety of senses, spaces, and respective
perceptions?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> None; except, perhaps, that
which for Science would be rather a handy peg on which to hang a
counter-argument. We have a different set of senses in dream-life,
have we not? We feel, talk, hear, see, taste and function in general
on a different plane; the change of state of our consciousness being
evidenced by the fact that a series of acts and events embracing years,
as we think, pass ideally through our mind in one instant. Well, that
extreme rapidity of our mental operations in dreams, and the perfect
naturalness, for the time being, of all the other functions, show us
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
that we are on quite another plane. Our philosophy teaches us that,
as there are seven fundamental forces in nature, and seven planes of
being, so there are seven states of consciousness in which man can
live, think, remember and have his being. To enumerate these here
is impossible, and for this one has to turn to the study of Eastern
metaphysics. But in these two states—the waking and the dreaming—every
ordinary mortal, from a learned philosopher down to a poor untutored
savage, has a good proof that such states differ.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You do not accept, then, the
well-known explanations of biology and physiology to account for the
dream state?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We do not. We reject even the
hypotheses of your psychologists, preferring the teachings of Eastern
Wisdom. Believing in seven planes of Kosmic being and states of
Consciousness, with regard to the Universe or the Macrocosm, we stop
at the fourth plane, finding it impossible to go with any degree
of certainty beyond. But with respect to the Microcosm, or man, we
speculate freely on his seven states and principles.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How do you explain these?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We find, first of all, two distinct
beings in man; the spiritual and the physical, the man who thinks,
and the man who records as much of these thoughts as he is able to
assimilate. Therefore we divide him into two distinct natures; the
upper or the spiritual being, composed of three “principles” or
<i>aspects</i>; and the lower or the physical quaternary, composed of
<i>four</i>—in all <i>seven</i>.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_6_4"></a>THE SEPTENARY NATURE OF MAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is it what we call Spirit and Soul,
and the man of flesh?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is not. That is the old Platonic
division. Plato was an Initiate, and therefore could not go into
forbidden details; but he who is acquainted with the archaic doctrine
finds the seven in Plato’s various combinations of Soul and Spirit. He
regarded man as constituted of two parts—one eternal, formed of the
same essence as the Absoluteness, the other mortal and corruptible,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
deriving its constituent parts from the <i>minor</i> “created” Gods.
Man is composed, he shows, of (1) A mortal body, (2) An immortal
principle, and (3) A “separate mortal kind of Soul.” It is that which
we respectively call the physical man, the Spiritual Soul or Spirit,
and the animal Soul (the <i>Nous</i> and <i>psuche</i>). This is the division
adopted by Paul, another Initiate, who maintains that there is a
psychical body which is sown in the corruptible (astral soul or body),
and a <i>spiritual</i> body that is raised in incorruptible substance. Even
James (iii. 15) corroborates the same by saying that the “wisdom” (of
our lower soul) descendeth not from the above, but is terrestrial
(“psychical,” “demoniacal,” <i>vide</i> Greek text); while the other is
heavenly wisdom. Now so plain is it that Plato and even Pythagoras,
while speaking but of three “principles,” give them seven separate
functions, in their various combinations, that if we contrast our
teachings this will become quite plain. Let us take a cursory view of
these seven aspects by drawing two tables.</p>

<p class="indent"> The letter <b>A</b> in the left hand column stands for
“<span class="smcap">The Upper Imperishable Triad.</span>” which was written vertically
in the original table.</p>
</div>
<p class="no-indent">Now what does Plato teach? He speaks of the <i>interior</i>
man as constituted of two parts—one immutable and always the same, formed of
the same <i>substance</i> as Deity, and the other mortal and corruptible.
These “two parts” are found in our upper <i>Triad</i>, and the lower
<i>Quaternary</i> (<i>vide</i> Table). He explains that when the Soul, <i>psuche</i>,
“allies herself to the Nous (divine spirit or substance<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20_20">[20]</a>),
she does everything aright and felicitously”; but the case is otherwise
when she attaches herself to <i>Anoia</i>, (folly, or the irrational animal
Soul). Here, then, we have <i>Manas</i> (or the Soul in general) in its
two aspects: when attaching itself to <i>Anoia</i> (our <i>Kama rupa</i>, or
the “Animal Soul” in “Esoteric Buddhism,”) it runs towards entire
annihilation, as far as the personal Ego is concerned; when allying
itself to the <i>Nous</i> (Atma-Buddhi) it merges into the immortal,
imperishable Ego, and then its spiritual consciousness of the personal
that <i>was</i>, becomes immortal.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_6_5"></a>THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SOUL AND SPIRIT.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you really teach, as you are
accused of doing by some Spiritualists and French Spiritists, the
annihilation of every personality?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We do not. But as this question
of the duality—the <i>individuality</i> of the Divine Ego, and the
<i>personality</i> of the human animal—involves that of the possibility of
the real immortal Ego appearing in <i>Séance rooms</i> as a “materialised
spirit,” which we deny as already explained, our opponents have started
the nonsensical charge.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You have just spoken of <i>psuche</i>
running towards its entire annihilation if it attaches itself to
<i>Anoia</i>. What did Plato, and do you mean by this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo</span>. The <i>entire</i> annihilation of the
<i>personal</i> consciousness, as an exceptional and rare case, I think. The
general and almost invariable rule is the merging of the personal into
the individual or immortal consciousness of the Ego, a transformation
or a divine transfiguration, and the entire annihilation only of
the lower <i>quaternary</i>. Would you expect the man of flesh, or the
<i>temporary personality</i>, his shadow, the “astral,” his animal instincts
and even physical life, to survive with the “spiritual Ego” and become
sempiternal? Naturally all this ceases to exist, either at, or soon
after corporeal death. It becomes in time entirely disintegrated and
disappears from view, being annihilated as a whole.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then you also reject <i>resurrection
in the flesh</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most decidedly we do! Why should
we, who believe in the archaic esoteric philosophy of the Ancients,
accept the unphilosophical speculations of the later Christian
theology, borrowed from the Egyptian and Greek exoteric Systems of the
Gnostics?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> The Egyptians revered
Nature-Spirits, and deified even onions: your Hindus are <i>idolaters</i>,
to this day; the Zoroastrians worshipped, and do still worship,
the Sun; and the best Greek philosophers were either dreamers or
materialists—witness Plato and Democritus. How can you compare?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It may be so in your modern
Christian and even Scientific catechism; it is not so for unbiased
minds. The Egyptians revered the “One-Only-One,” as <i>Nout</i>; and it
is from this word that Anaxagoras got his denomination <i>Nous</i>, or as
he calls it, <b>Νους αυτοχρατης</b>, “the Mind or Spirit Self-Potent,” the
<b>αρχητης χινηδεως</b>, the leading motor, or <i>primum-mobile</i> of all. With
him the <i>Nous</i> was God, and the <i>logos</i> was man, his emanation. The
<i>Nous</i> is the spirit (whether in Kosmos or in man), and the <i>logos</i>,
whether Universe or astral body, the emanation of the former, the
physical body being merely the animal. Our external powers perceive
<i>phenomena</i>; our <i>Nous</i> alone is able to recognise their <i>noumena</i>.
It is the logos alone, or the <i>noumenon</i>, that survives, because it
is immortal in its very nature and essence, and the <i>logos</i> in man is
the Eternal Ego, that which reincarnates and lasts for ever. But how
can the evanescent or external shadow, the temporary clothing of that
divine Emanation which returns to the source whence it proceeded, be
that <i>which is raised in incorruptibility</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Still you can hardly escape the
charge of having invented a new division of man’s spiritual and psychic constituents;
for no philosopher speaks of them, though you believe that Plato does.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And I support the view. Besides
Plato, there is Pythagoras, who also followed the same idea.<a id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21_21">[21]</a>
He described the <i>Soul</i> as a self-moving Unit (<i>monad</i>) composed of
three elements, the <i>Nous</i> (Spirit), the <i>phren</i> (mind), and the
<i>thumos</i> (life, breath or the <i>Nephesh</i> of the Kabalists) which three
correspond to our “Atma-Buddhi,” (higher Spirit-Soul), to <i>Manas</i> (The
<span class="smcap">Ego</span>), and to <i>Kama-rupa</i> in conjunction
with the <i>lower</i> reflection of Manas. That which the Ancient Greek
philosophers termed <i>Soul</i>, in general, we call Spirit, or Spiritual
<i>Soul</i>, <i>Buddhi</i>, as the vehicle of <i>Atma</i> (the <i>Agathon</i>, or Plato’s
Supreme Deity). The fact that Pythagoras and others state that <i>phren</i>
and <i>thumos</i> are shared by us with the brutes, proves that in this
case the <i>lower</i> Manasic reflection (instinct) and <i>Kama-rupa</i> (animal
living passions) are meant. And as Socrates and Plato accepted the
clue and followed it, if to these five, namely, <i>Agathon</i> (Deity or
Atma), <i>Psuche</i> (Soul in its collective sense), <i>Nous</i> (Spirit or
Mind), <i>Phren</i> (physical mind), and <i>Thumos</i> (Kama-rupa or passions)
we add the <i>eidolon</i> of the Mysteries, the shadowy <i>form</i> or the human
double, and the <i>physical body</i>, it will be easy to demonstrate that
the ideas of both Pythagoras and Plato were identical with ours. Even
the Egyptians held to the Septenary division. In its exit, they taught,
the Soul (<span class="smcap">Ego</span>) had to pass through its seven
chambers, or principles, those it left behind, and those it took along
with itself. The only difference is that, ever bearing in mind the
penalty of revealing Mystery-doctrines, which was <i>death</i>, they gave
out the teaching in a broad outline, while we elaborate it and explain
it in its details. But though we do give out to the world as much as
is lawful, even in our doctrine more than one important detail is
withheld, which those who study the esoteric philosophy and are pledged
to silence, <i>are alone entitled to know</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_6_6"></a>THE GREEK TEACHINGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> We have magnificent Greek and Latin,
Sanskrit and Hebrew scholars. How is it that we find nothing in their
translations that would afford us a clue to what you say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because your translators, their
great learning notwithstanding, have made of the philosophers, the
Greeks especially, <i>misty</i> instead of mystic writers. Take as an
instance Plutarch, and read what he says of “the principles” of
man. That which he describes was accepted literally and attributed
to metaphysical superstition and ignorance. Let me give you an
illustration in point: “Man,” says Plutarch, “is compound; and they
are <i>mistaken who think him to be compounded of two parts only</i>. For
they imagine that the understanding (brain intellect) is a part of
the soul (the upper Triad), but they err in this no less than those
who make the soul to be a part of the body, <i>i.e.</i>, those who make
of the <i>Triad</i> part of the corruptible mortal <i>quaternary</i>. For the
understanding (nous) as far exceeds the soul, as the soul is better and
diviner than the body. Now this composition of the soul (<b>ψυχη</b>)
with the understanding (<b>νοῦς</b>) makes reason; and with the body
(or thumos, the animal soul) passion; of which the one is the beginning
or principle of pleasure and pain, and the other of virtue and vice.
Of these three parts conjoined and compacted together, the earth has
given the body, the moon the soul, and the sun the understanding to the
generation of man.”</p>
<p>This last sentence is purely allegorical, and will be comprehended
only by those who are versed in the esoteric science of correspondences
and know which planet is <i>related to every principle</i>. Plutarch
divides the latter into three groups, and makes of the body a compound
of physical frame, astral shadow, and breath, or the triple lower
part, which “from earth was taken and to earth returns”; of the middle
principle and the instinctual soul, the second part, derived <i>from</i> and
<i>through</i> and ever influenced by the moon<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22_22">[22]</a>;
and only of the higher part or the <i>Spiritual Soul</i>, with the Atmic and
Manasic elements in it does he make a direct emanation of the Sun, who
stands here for <i>Agathon</i> the Supreme Deity. This is proven by what he
says further as follows:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“Now of the deaths we die, the one makes man two
of three and the other one of (out of) two. The former is in the region
and jurisdiction of Demeter, whence the name given to the Mysteries,
<b>τελειν</b>, resembled that given to death, <b>τελευταν</b>. The
Athenians also heretofore called the deceased sacred to Demeter. As for
the other death, it is in the moon or region of Persephone.”</p>
<p class="no-indent">Here you have our doctrine, which shows man a
<i>septenary</i> during life; a <i>quintile</i> just after death, in Kama-loka;
and a threefold <i>Ego</i>, Spirit-Soul, and consciousness in <i>Devachan</i>.
This separation, first in “the Meadows of Hades,” as Plutarch calls the
<i>Kama-loka</i>, then in Devachan, was part and parcel of the performances
during the sacred Mysteries, when the candidates for initiation enacted
the whole drama of death, and the resurrection as a glorified spirit,
by which name we mean <i>Consciousness</i>. This is what Plutarch means when
he says:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“And as with the one, the terrestrial, so with
the other celestial Hermes doth dwell. This suddenly and with violence
plucks the soul from the body; but Proserpina mildly and in a long time
disjoins the understanding from the soul.<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23_23">[23]</a>
For this reason she is called <i>Monogenes, only begotten</i>, or rather
<i>begetting one alone</i>; for <i>the better part of man becomes alone when
it is separated by her</i>. Now both the one and the other happens thus
according to nature. It is ordained by Fate (Fatum or Karma) that every
soul, whether with or without understanding (mind), when gone out of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
body, should wander for a time, though not all for the same, in the
region lying between the earth and moon (<i>Kama-loka</i>).<a id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24_24">[24]</a>
For those that have been unjust and dissolute suffer then the
punishment due to their offences; but the good and virtuous are there
detained till they are purified, and have, by expiation, purged out of
them all the infections they might have contracted from the contagion
of the body, as if from foul health, living in the mildest part of the
air, called the Meadows of Hades, where they must remain for a certain
prefixed and appointed time. And then, as if they were returning from
a wandering pilgrimage or long exile into their country, they have a
taste of joy, such as they principally receive who are initiated into
Sacred Mysteries, mixed with trouble, admiration, and each one’s proper
and peculiar hope.”</p>
<p class="no-indent"> This is Nirvanic bliss, and no Theosophist
could describe in plainer though esoteric language the mental joys
of Devachan, where every man has his paradise around him, erected
by his consciousness. But you must beware of the general error into
which too many even of our Theosophists fall. Do not imagine that
because man is called septenary, then <i>quintuple</i> and a triad, he is
a compound of seven, five, or three <i>entities</i>; or, as well expressed
by a Theosophical writer, of skins to be peeled off like the skins of
an onion. The “principles,” as already said, save the body, the life,
and the astral <i>eidolon</i>, all of which disperse at death, are simply
<i>aspects</i> and <i>states of consciousness</i>. There is but one <i>real</i> man,
enduring through the cycle of life and immortal in essence, if not in
form, and this is <i>Manas</i>, the Mind-man or embodied Consciousness. The
objection made by the materialists, who deny the possibility of mind
and consciousness acting without matter is worthless in our case. We
do not deny the soundness of their argument; but we simply ask our
opponents, “Are you acquainted <i>with all the states of matter</i>, you
who knew hitherto but of three? And how do you know whether that which
we refer to as ABSOLUTE CONSCIOUSNESS or Deity for ever invisible and
unknowable, be not that which, though it eludes for ever our human
<i>finite</i> conception, is still universal Spirit-matter or matter-Spirit
<i>in its absolute infinitude</i>?” It is then one of the lowest, and in its
manvantaric manifestations <i>fractioned</i>-aspects of this Spirit-matter,
which is the conscious <i>Ego</i> that creates its own paradise, a fool’s
paradise, it may be, still a state of bliss.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what is <i>Devachan</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The “land of gods” literally; a
condition, a state of mental bliss. Philosophically a mental condition
analogous to, but far more vivid and real than, the most vivid dream.
It is the state after death of most mortals.

<h2>VII. <br>ON THE VARIOUS POST MORTEM STATES.</h2></div>
<h3>THE PHYSICAL AND THE SPIRITUAL MAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I am glad to hear you believe in the
immortality of the Soul.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not of “the Soul,” but of the
divine Spirit; or rather in the immortality of the reincarnating
Ego.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> A very great one in our
philosophy, but this is too abstruse and difficult a question to touch
lightly upon. We shall have to analyse them separately, and then in
conjunction. We may begin with Spirit.</p>
<p>We say that the Spirit (the “Father in secret” of Jesus), or
<i>Atman</i>, is no individual property of any man, but is the Divine
essence which has no body, no form, which is imponderable, invisible
and indivisible, that which does not <i>exist</i> and yet <i>is</i>, as the
Buddhists say of Nirvana. It only overshadows the mortal; that which
enters into him and pervades the whole body being only its omnipresent
rays, or light, radiated through <i>Buddhi</i>, its vehicle and direct
emanation. This is the secret meaning of the assertions of almost all
the ancient philosophers, when they said that “the <i>rational</i> part of
man’s soul”<a id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25_25">[25]</a>
never entered wholly into the man, but only overshadowed him more or
less through the <i>irrational</i> spiritual Soul or Buddhi.<a id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26_26">[26]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I laboured under the impression
that the “Animal Soul” alone was irrational, not the Divine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You have to learn the difference
between that which is negatively, or <i>passively</i> “irrational,” because
undifferentiated, and that which is irrational because too <i>active</i>
and positive. Man is a correlation of spiritual powers, as well as a
correlation of chemical and physical forces, brought into function by
what we call “principles.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have read a good deal upon the
subject, and it seems to me that the notions of the older philosophers
differed a great deal from those of the mediæval Kabalists, though they
do agree in some particulars.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The most substantial difference
between them and us is this. While we believe with the Neo-Platonists
and the Eastern teachings that the spirit (Atma) never descends
hypostatically into the living man, but only showers more or less its
radiance on the <i>inner</i> man (the psychic and spiritual compound of the
<i>astral</i> principles), the Kabalists maintain that the human Spirit,
detaching itself from the ocean of light and Universal Spirit, enters
man’s Soul, where it remains throughout life imprisoned in the astral
capsule. All Christian Kabalists still maintain the same, as they are
unable to break quite loose from their anthropomorphic and Biblical
doctrines.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what do you say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We say that we only allow the
presence of the radiation of Spirit (or Atma) in the astral capsule,
and so far only as that spiritual radiancy is concerned. We say that
man and Soul have to conquer their immortality by ascending towards the
unity with which, if successful, they will be finally linked and into
which they are finally, so to speak, absorbed. The individualization
of man after death depends on the spirit, not on his soul and body.
Although the word “personality,” in the sense in which it is usually
understood, is an absurdity if applied literally to our immortal
essence, still the latter is, as our individual Ego, a distinct entity,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
immortal and eternal, <i>per se</i>. <i>It is only in the case of black
magicians or of criminals beyond redemption, criminals who have been
such during a long series of lives</i>—that the shining thread, which
links the spirit to the <i>personal</i> soul from the moment of the birth
of the child, is violently snapped, and the disembodied entity becomes
divorced from the personal soul, the latter being annihilated without
leaving the smallest impression of itself on the former. If that union
between the lower, or personal Manas, and the individual reincarnating
Ego, has not been effected during life, then the former is left to
share the fate of the lower animals, to gradually dissolve into ether,
and have its personality annihilated. But even then the Ego remains
a distinct being. It (the spiritual Ego) only loses one Devachanic
state—after that special, and in that case indeed useless, life—as
that idealized <i>Personality</i>, and is reincarnated, after enjoying for a
short time its freedom as a planetary spirit, almost immediately.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> It is stated in <i>Isis Unveiled</i>
that such planetary Spirits or Angels, “the gods of the Pagans or the
Archangels of the Christians,” will never be men on our planet.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Quite right. Not “<i>such</i>,” but
<i>some</i> classes of higher Planetary Spirits. They will never be men
on this planet, because they are liberated Spirits from a previous,
earlier world, and as such they cannot re-become men on this one. Yet
all these will live again in the next and far higher Mahamanvantara,
after this “great Age,” and “Brahma <i>pralaya</i>,” (a little period of
16 figures or so) is over. For you must have heard, of course, that
Eastern philosophy teaches us that mankind consists of such “Spirits”
imprisoned in human bodies? The difference between animals and men is
this: the former are ensouled by the “principles” <i>potentially</i>, the
latter <i>actually</i>.<a id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27_27">[27]</a>
Do you understand now the difference?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yes; but this specialisation has
been in all ages the stumbling-block of metaphysicians.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It was. The whole esotericism
of the Buddhistic philosophy is based on this mysterious teaching,
understood by so few persons, and so totally misrepresented by many of
the most learned modern scholars. Even metaphysicians are too inclined
to confound the effect with the cause. An Ego who has won his immortal
life as spirit will remain the same inner self throughout all his
rebirths on earth; but this does not imply necessarily that he must
either remain the Mr. Smith or Mr. Brown he was on earth, or lose his
individuality. Therefore, the astral soul and the terrestrial body of
man may, in the dark hereafter, be absorbed into the cosmical ocean
of sublimated elements, and cease to feel his last <i>personal</i> Ego (if
it did not deserve to soar higher), and the <i>divine</i> Ego still remain
the same unchanged entity, though this terrestrial experience of his
emanation may be totally obliterated at the instant of separation from
the unworthy vehicle.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> If the “Spirit,” or the divine
portion of the soul, is pre-existent as a distinct being from
all eternity, as Origen, Synesius, and other semi-Christians and
semi-Platonic philosophers taught, and if it is the same, and nothing
more than the metaphysically-objective soul, how can it be otherwise
than eternal? And what matters it in such a case, whether man leads
a pure life or an animal, if, do what he may, he can never lose his
individuality?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This doctrine, as you have stated
it, is just as pernicious in its consequences as that of vicarious
atonement. Had the latter dogma, in company with the false idea that
we are all immortal, been demonstrated to the world in its true light,
humanity would have been bettered by its propagation.</p>
<p class="indent">Let me repeat to you again. Pythagoras, Plato,
Timaeus of Locris, and the old Alexandrian School, derived the
<i>Soul</i> of man (or his higher “principles” and attributes) from the
Universal World Soul, the latter being, according to their teachings,
<i>Aether</i> (Pater-Zeus). Therefore, neither of these “principles” can be
<i>unalloyed</i> essence of the Pythagorean Monas, or our <i>Atma-Buddhi</i>,
because the <i>Anima Mundi</i> is but the effect, the subjective emanation
or rather radiation of the former. Both the <i>human</i> Spirit (or the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
individuality), the reincarnating Spiritual Ego, and Buddhi, the
Spiritual soul, are pre-existent. But, while the former exists
as a distinct entity, an individualization, the soul exists as
pre-existing breath, an unscient portion of an intelligent whole. Both
were originally formed from the Eternal Ocean of light; but as the
Fire-Philosophers, the mediæval Theosophists, expressed it, there is
a visible as well as invisible spirit in fire. They made a difference
between the <i>anima bruta</i> and the <i>anima divina</i>. Empedocles firmly
believed all men and animals to possess two souls; and in Aristotle
we find that he calls one the reasoning soul, νους and the other, the
animal soul, ψυχη. According to these philosophers, the reasoning
soul comes from <i>within</i> the universal soul, and the other from <i>without</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Would you call the Soul, <i>i.e.</i>, the
human thinking Soul, or what you call the Ego—matter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not matter, but substance
assuredly; nor would the word “matter,” if prefixed with the adjective,
<i>primordial</i>, be a word to avoid. That matter, we say, is co-eternal
with Spirit, and is not our visible, tangible, and divisible matter,
but its extreme sublimation. Pure Spirit is but one remove from
the <i>no</i>-Spirit, or the absolute <i>all</i>. Unless you admit that man
was evolved out of this primordial Spirit-matter, and represents a
regular progressive scale of “principles” from <i>meta</i>-Spirit down to
the grossest matter, how can we ever come to regard the <i>inner</i> man
as immortal, and at the same time as a spiritual Entity and a mortal
man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then why should you not believe in
God as such an Entity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because that which is infinite
and unconditioned can have no form, and cannot be a being, not in any
Eastern philosophy worthy of the name, at any rate. An “entity” is
immortal, but is so only in its ultimate essence, not in its individual
form. When at the last point of its cycle, it is absorbed into its
primordial nature; and it becomes spirit, when it loses its name of Entity.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Its immortality as a form is limited only to its
life-cycle or the <i>Mahamanvantara</i>; after which it is one and identical
with the Universal Spirit, and no longer a separate Entity. As to
the <i>personal</i> Soul—by which we mean the spark of consciousness that
preserves in the Spiritual Ego the idea of the personal “I” of the
last incarnation—this lasts, as a separate distinct recollection,
only throughout the Devachanic period; after which time it is added
to the series of other innumerable incarnations of the Ego, like the
remembrance in our memory of one of a series of days, at the end of a
year. Will you bind the infinitude you claim for your God to finite
conditions? That alone which is indissolubly cemented by <i>Atma</i>
(<i>i.e.</i>, Buddhi-Manas) is immortal. The Soul of man (<i>i.e.</i>, of the
personality) <i>per se</i> is neither immortal, eternal nor divine. Says the
<i>Zohar</i> (vol. iii., p. 616), “the soul, when sent to this earth, puts
on an earthly garment, to preserve herself here, so she receives above
a shining garment, in order to be able to look without injury into the
mirror, whose light proceeds from the Lord of Light.” Moreover, the
<i>Zohar</i> teaches that the soul cannot reach the abode of bliss, unless
she has received the “holy kiss,” or the reunion of the soul <i>with the
substance from which she emanated</i>—spirit. All souls are dual, and,
while the latter is a feminine principle, the spirit is masculine.
While imprisoned in body, man is a trinity, unless his pollution is
such as to have caused his divorce from the spirit. “Woe to the soul
which prefers to her divine husband (spirit) the earthly wedlock with
her terrestrial body,” records a text of the <i>Book of the Keys</i>, a
Hermetic work. Woe indeed, for nothing will remain of that personality
to be recorded on the imperishable tablets of the Ego’s memory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How can that which, if not breathed
by God into man, yet is on your own confession of an identical
substance with the divine, fail to be immortal?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Every atom and speck of matter,
not of substance only, is <i>imperishable</i> in its essence, but not in
its <i>individual consciousness</i>. Immortality is but one’s unbroken
consciousness; and the <i>personal</i> consciousness can hardly last longer
than the personality itself, can it? And such consciousness, as I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
already told you, survives only throughout Devachan, after which it is
reabsorbed, first, in the <i>individual</i>, and then in the <i>universal</i>
consciousness. Better enquire of your theologians how it is that they
have so sorely jumbled up the Jewish Scriptures. Read the Bible, if
you would have a good proof that the writers of the <i>Pentateuch</i>,
and <i>Genesis</i> especially, never regarded <i>nephesh</i>, that which God
breathes into Adam (Gen. ch. ii.), as the <i>immortal</i> soul. Here are
some instances:—“And God created ... every <i>nephesh</i> (life) that
moveth” (Gen i. 21), meaning animals; and (Gen. ii. 7) it is said:
“And man became a <i>nephesh</i>” (living soul), which shows that the word
<i>nephesh</i> was indifferently applied to <i>immortal</i> man and to <i>mortal</i>
beast. “And surely your blood of your <i>nepheshim</i> (lives) will I
require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand
of man” (Gen. ix. 5), “Escape for <i>nephesh</i>” (escape for thy <i>life</i>,
it is translated), (Gen. xix. 17). “Let us not kill him,” reads the
English version (Gen. xxxvii. 21). “Let us not kill his <i>nephesh</i>” is
the Hebrew text. “<i>Nephesh</i> for <i>nephesh</i>,” says Leviticus (xvii. 8).
“He that killeth any man shall surely be put to death,” literally “He
that smiteth the <i>nephesh</i> of a man” (Lev. xxiv. 17); and from verse
18 and following it reads: “And he that killeth a beast (<i>nephesh</i>)
shall make it good ... Beast for beast,” whereas the original text has
it “nephesh for nephesh.” How could man <i>kill</i> that which is immortal?
And this explains also why the Sadducees denied the immortality of the
soul, as it also affords another proof that very probably the Mosaic
Jews—the uninitiated at any rate—never believed in the soul’s survival at all.</p>

positively refuse to accept the cruel and unphilosophical belief in
eternal reward or eternal punishment. We say with Horace:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Let rules be fixed that may our rage contain,</span>
<span class="i0">And punish faults <i>with a proportion’d pain</i>;</span>
<span class="i0">But do not flay him who deserves alone</span>
<span class="i0">A whipping for the fault that he has done.”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="no-indent"> This is a rule for all men, and a just one. Have
we to believe that God, of whom you make the embodiment of wisdom, love
and mercy, is less entitled to these attributes than mortal man?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Have you any other reasons for
rejecting this dogma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Our chief reason for it lies in
the fact of re-incarnation. As already stated, we reject the idea of
a new soul created for every newly-born babe. We believe that every
human being is the bearer, or <i>Vehicle</i>, of an <i>Ego</i> coeval with every
other Ego; because all <i>Egos</i> are <i>of the same essence</i> and belong to
the primeval emanation from one universal infinite <i>Ego</i>. Plato calls
the latter the <i>logos</i> (or the second manifested God); and we, the
manifested divine principle, which is one with the universal mind or
soul, not the anthropomorphic, extra-cosmic and <i>personal</i> God in which
so many Theists believe. Pray do not confuse.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But where is the difficulty, once
you accept a manifested principle, in believing that the soul of every
new mortal is <i>created</i> by that Principle, as all the Souls before it
have been so created?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because that which is <i>impersonal</i>
can hardly create, plan and think, at its own sweet will and pleasure.
Being a universal <i>Law</i>, immutable in its periodical manifestations,
those of radiating and manifesting its own essence at the beginning of
every new cycle of life, <span class="smcap">IT</span> is not supposed
to create men, only to repent a few years later of having created them.
If we have to believe in a divine principle at all, it must be in one
which is as absolute harmony, logic, and justice, as it is absolute
love, wisdom, and impartiality; and a God who would <i>create</i> every soul
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for the space of <i>one brief span of life</i>, regardless of the fact
whether it has to animate the body of a wealthy, happy man, or that of
a poor suffering wretch, hapless from birth to death though he has done
nothing to deserve his cruel fate—would be rather a senseless <i>fiend</i>
than a God. (<i>Vide infra</i>, “On the Punishment of the Ego.”) Why, even
the Jewish philosophers, believers in the Mosaic Bible (esoterically,
of course), have never entertained such an idea; and, moreover, they
believed in re-incarnation, as we do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you give me some instances as a proof of this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most decidedly I can. Philo Judæus
says (in “De Somniis,” p. 455): “The air is full of them (of souls);
those which are nearest the earth, descending to be tied to mortal
bodies, <b>παλινδρομοῦσιν αὖθις</b> <i>return to other bodies, being
desirous to live in them</i>.” In the <i>Zohar</i>, the soul is made to plead
her freedom before God: “Lord of the Universe! I am happy in this
world, and do not wish to go into another world, where I shall be a
handmaid, and be exposed to all kinds of pollutions.”<a id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28_28">[28]</a>
The doctrine of fatal necessity, the everlasting immutable law, is
asserted in the answer of the Deity: “Against thy will thou becomest an
embryo, and against thy will thou art born.”<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29_29">[29]</a>
Light would be incomprehensible without darkness to make it manifest
by contrast; good would be no longer good without evil to show the
priceless nature of the boon; and so personal virtue could claim no
merit, unless it had passed through the furnace of temptation. Nothing
is eternal and unchangeable, save the concealed Deity. Nothing that
is finite—whether because it had a beginning, or must have an end—can
remain stationary. It must either progress or recede; and a soul which
thirsts after a reunion with its spirit, which alone confers upon it
immortality, must purify itself through cyclic transmigrations onward
toward the only land of bliss and eternal rest, called in the <i>Zohar</i>,
“The Palace of Love,” <b>היבל אחכה</b>; in the Hindu religion, “Moksha”; among
the Gnostics, “The Pleroma of Eternal Light”; and by the Buddhists,
“Nirvana.” And all these states are temporary, not eternal.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet there is no re-incarnation
spoken of in all this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> A soul which pleads to be allowed
to remain where she is, <i>must be pre-existent</i>, and not have been
created for the occasion. In the <i>Zohar</i> (vol. iii., p. 61), however,
there is a still better proof. Speaking of the reincarnating <i>Egos</i>
(the <i>rational</i> souls), those whose last personality has to fade out
<i>entirely</i>, it is said: “All souls which have alienated themselves in
heaven from the Holy One—blessed be His name—have thrown themselves
into an abyss at their very existence, and have anticipated the time
when they are to descend once more on earth.” “The Holy One” means
here, esoterically, the Atman, or <i>Atma-Buddhi</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Moreover, it is very strange to find
<i>Nirvana</i> spoken of as something synonymous with the Kingdom of Heaven,
or the Paradise, since according to every Orientalist of note Nirvana
is a synonym of annihilation!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Taken literally, with regard to
the personality and differentiated matter, not otherwise. These ideas
on re-incarnation and the trinity of man were held by many of the
early Christian Fathers. It is the jumble made by the translators of
the New Testament and ancient philosophical treatises between soul
and spirit, that has occasioned the many misunderstandings. It is
also one of the many reasons why Buddha, Plotinus, and so many other
Initiates are now accused of having longed for the total extinction
of their souls: “absorption unto the Deity,” or “reunion with the
universal soul,” meaning, according to modern ideas, annihilation. The
personal soul must, of course, be disintegrated into its particles,
before it is able to link its purer essence for ever with the immortal
spirit. But the translators of both the <i>Acts</i> and the <i>Epistles</i>,
who laid the foundation of the <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>, and the modern
commentators on the Buddhist <i>Sutra of the Foundation of the Kingdom of Righteousness</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
have muddled the sense of the great apostle of Christianity as of the
great reformer of India. The former have smothered the word ψυχικος
so that no reader imagines it to have any relation with <i>soul</i>;
and with this confusion of <i>soul</i> and <i>spirit</i> together, <i>Bible</i>
readers get only a perverted sense of anything on the subject. On
the other hand, the interpreters of Buddha have failed to understand
the meaning and object of the Buddhist four degrees of Dhyâna. Ask
the Pythagoreans, “Can that spirit, which gives life and motion and
partakes of the nature of light, be reduced to nonentity?” “Can even
that sensitive spirit in brutes which exercises memory, one of the
rational faculties, die and become nothing?” observe the Occultists. In
Buddhistic philosophy <i>annihilation</i> means only a dispersion of matter,
in whatever form or <i>semblance</i> of form it may be, for everything that
has form is temporary, and is, therefore, really an illusion. For in
eternity the longest periods of time are as a wink of the eye. So with
form. Before we have time to realize that we have seen it, it is gone
like an instantaneous flash of lightning, and passed for ever. When the
Spiritual <i>entity</i> breaks loose for ever from every particle of matter,
substance, or form, and re-becomes a Spiritual breath: then only does
it enter upon the eternal and unchangeable <i>Nirvana</i>, lasting as long
as the cycle of life has lasted—an eternity, truly. And then that
Breath, existing <i>in Spirit</i>, is <i>nothing</i> because it is <i>all</i>; as a
form, a semblance, a shape, it is completely annihilated; as absolute
Spirit it still is, for it has become <i>Be-ness</i> itself. The very word
used, “absorbed in the universal essence,” when spoken of the “Soul” as
Spirit, means “<i>union with</i>.” It can never mean annihilation, as that
would mean eternal separation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you not lay yourself open to the
accusation of preaching annihilation by the language you yourself use?
You have just spoken of the Soul of man returning to its primordial
elements.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> But you forget that I have given
you the differences between the various meanings of the word “Soul,”
and shown the loose way in which the term “Spirit” has been hitherto
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
translated. We speak of an <i>animal</i>, a <i>human</i>, and a <i>spiritual</i>,
Soul, and distinguish between them. Plato, for instance, calls
“rational <span class="smcap">Soul</span>” that which we call <i>Buddhi</i>,
adding to it the adjective of “spiritual,” however; but that which we
call the reincarnating Ego, <i>Manas</i>, he calls Spirit, <i>Nous</i>, etc.,
whereas we apply the term <i>Spirit</i>, when standing alone and without any
qualification, to Atma alone. Pythagoras repeats our archaic doctrine
when stating that the <i>Ego</i> (<i>Nous</i>) is eternal with Deity; that the
soul only passed through various stages to arrive at divine excellence;
while <i>thumos</i> returned to the earth, and even the <i>phren</i>, the lower
<i>Manas</i>, was eliminated. Again, Plato defines <i>Soul</i> (Buddhi) as “the
motion that is able to move itself.” “Soul,” he adds (Laws X.), “is
the most ancient of all things, and the commencement of motion,” thus
calling Atma-Buddhi “Soul,” and <i>Manas</i> “Spirit,” which we do not.</p>
<p class="blockquot"> “Soul was generated prior to body, and body is
posterior and secondary, as being according to nature, ruled over by
the ruling soul.” “The soul which administers all things that are moved
in every way, administers likewise the heavens.”</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Soul then leads everything in heaven, and on
earth, and in the sea, by its movements—the names of which are, to
will, to consider, to take care of, to consult, to form opinions
true and false, to be in a state of joy, sorrow, confidence, fear,
hate, love, together with all such primary movements as are allied to
these.... Being a goddess herself, she ever takes as an ally <i>Nous</i>, a
god, and disciplines all things correctly and happily; but when with
<i>Annoia</i>—not <i>nous</i>—it works out everything the contrary.”</p>
<p class="no-indent">In this language, as in the Buddhist texts, the
negative is treated as essential existence. <i>Annihilation</i> comes under
a similar exegesis. The positive state is essential being, but no
manifestation as such. When the spirit, in Buddhistic parlance, enters
<i>Nirvana</i>, it loses objective existence, but retains subjective being.
To objective minds this is becoming absolute “nothing”; to subjective,
<span class="smcap">No-thing</span>, nothing to be displayed to sense.
Thus, their Nirvana means the certitude of individual immortality <i>in
Spirit</i>, not in Soul, which, though “the most ancient of all things,”
is still—along with all the other <i>Gods</i>—a finite emanation, in <i>forms</i>
and individuality, if not in substance.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I do not quite seize the idea
yet, and would be thankful to have you explain this to me by some
illustrations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No doubt it is very difficult to
understand, especially to one brought up in the regular orthodox ideas
of the Christian Church. Moreover, I must tell you one thing; and this
is that unless you have studied thoroughly well the separate functions
assigned to all the human “principles” and the state of all these
<i>after death</i>, you will hardly realize our Eastern philosophy.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_7_3"></a>ON THE VARIOUS “PRINCIPLES” IN MAN.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have heard a good deal about this
constitution of the “inner man” as you call it, but could never make
“head or tail on’t” as Gabalis expresses it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Of course, it is most difficult,
and, as you say, “puzzling” to understand correctly and distinguish
between the various <i>aspects</i>, called by us, the “principles” of the
real <span class="smcap">Ego</span>. It is the more so as there exists
a notable difference in the numbering of those principles by various
Eastern schools, though at the bottom there is the same identical
substratum of teaching.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you mean the Vedantins, as an
instance? Don’t they divide your seven “principles” into five only?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They do; but though I would not
presume to dispute the point with a learned Vedantin, I may yet state
as my private opinion that they have an obvious reason for it. With
them it is only that compound spiritual aggregate which consists of
various mental aspects that is called <i>Man</i> at all, the physical
body being in their view something beneath contempt, and merely an
<i>illusion</i>. Nor is the Vedanta the only philosophy to reckon in this
manner. Lao-Tze, in his <i>Tao-te-King</i>, mentions only five principles,
because he, like the Vedantins, omits to include two principles,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
namely, the spirit (Atma) and the physical body, the latter of
which, moreover, he calls “the cadaver.” Then there is the <i>Taraka
Rajà Yogà</i> School. Its teaching recognises only three “principles”
in fact; but then, in reality, their <i>Sthulopadi</i>, or the physical
body, in its waking conscious state, their <i>Sukshmopadhi</i>, the same
body in <i>Svapna</i>, or the dreaming state, and their <i>Karanopadhi</i> or
“causal body,” or that which passes from one incarnation to another,
are all dual in their aspects, and thus make six. Add to this Atma,
the impersonal divine principle or the immortal element in Man,
undistinguished from the Universal Spirit, and you have the same seven
again.<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30_30">[30]</a>
They are welcome to hold to their division; we hold to ours.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then it seems almost the same as the
division made by the mystic Christians: body, soul and spirit?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just the same. We could easily
make of the body the vehicle of the “vital Double”; of the latter
the vehicle of Life or <i>Pranâ</i>; of <i>Kama-rupa</i>, or (animal) soul,
the vehicle of the <i>higher</i> and the <i>lower</i> mind, and make of this
six principles, crowning the whole with the one immortal spirit. In
Occultism every qualificative change in the state of our consciousness
gives to man a new aspect, and if it prevails and becomes part of the
living and acting Ego, it must be (and is) given a special name, to
distinguish the man in that particular state from the man he is when he
places himself in another state.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> It is just that which it is so
difficult to understand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It seems to me very easy, on the
contrary, once that you have seized the main idea, <i>i.e.</i>, that man
acts on this or another plane of consciousness, in strict accordance
with his mental and spiritual condition. But such is the materialism
of the age that the more we explain the less people seem capable of
understanding what we say. Divide the terrestrial being called man into
three chief aspects, if you like, and unless you make of him a pure
animal you cannot do less. Take his objective <i>body</i>; the thinking
principle in him—which is only a little higher than the <i>instinctual</i>
element in the animal—or the vital conscious soul; and that which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
places him so immeasurably beyond and higher than the animal—<i>i.e.</i>,
his <i>reasoning</i> soul or “spirit.” Well, if we take these three groups
or representative entities, and subdivide them, according to the occult
teaching, what do we get?</p>
<p class="indent">First of all, Spirit (in the sense of the Absolute,
and therefore, indivisible <span class="smcap">All</span>), or Atma.
As this can neither be located nor limited in philosophy, being simply
that which <span class="smcap">IS</span> in Eternity, and which cannot
be absent from even the tiniest geometrical or mathematical point
of the universe of matter or substance, it ought not to be called,
in truth, a “human” principle at all. Rather, and at best, it is in
Metaphysics, that point in space which the human Monad and its vehicle
man occupy for the period of every life. Now that point is as imaginary
as man himself, and in reality is an illusion, a <i>maya</i>; but then for
ourselves, as for other personal Egos, we are a reality during that fit
of illusion called life, and we have to take ourselves into account,
in our own fancy at any rate, if no one else does. To make it more
conceivable to the human intellect, when first attempting the study
of Occultism, and to solve the A B C of the mystery of man, Occultism
calls this <i>seventh</i> principle the synthesis of the sixth, and gives
it for vehicle the <i>Spiritual</i> Soul, <i>Buddhi</i>. Now the latter conceals
a mystery, which is never given to any one, with the exception of
irrevocably pledged <i>chelas</i>, or those, at any rate, who can be safely
trusted. Of course, there would be less confusion, could it only be
told; but, as this is directly concerned with the power of projecting
one’s double consciously and at will, and as this gift, like the
“ring of Gyges,” would prove very fatal to man at large and to the
possessor of that faculty in particular, it is carefully guarded. But
let us proceed with the “principles.” This divine soul, or Buddhi,
then, is the vehicle of the Spirit. In conjunction, these two are one,
impersonal and without any attributes (on this plane, of course), and
make two spiritual “principles.” If we pass on to the <i>Human</i> Soul,
<i>Manas</i> or <i>mens</i>, every one will agree that the intelligence of man is
<i>dual</i> to say the least: <i>e.g.</i>, the high-minded man can hardly become
low-minded; the very intellectual and spiritual-minded man is separated
by an abyss from the obtuse, dull, and material, if not animal-minded man.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why should not man be
represented by two “principles” or two aspects, rather?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Every man has these two principles
in him, one more active than the other, and in rare cases, one of
these is entirely stunted in its growth, so to say, or paralysed by
the strength and predominance of the other <i>aspect</i>, in whatever
direction. These, then, are what we call the two principles or aspects
of <i>Manas</i>, the higher and the lower; the former, the higher Manas,
or the thinking, conscious <span class="smcap">Ego</span> gravitating
toward the spiritual Soul (Buddhi); and the latter, or its instinctual
principle, attracted to <i>Kama</i>, the seat of animal desires and passions
in man. Thus, we have <i>four</i> “principles” justified; the last three
being (1) the “Double,” which we have agreed to call Protean, or
Plastic Soul; the vehicle of (2) the life <i>principle</i>; and (3) the
physical body. Of course no physiologist or biologist will accept these
principles, nor can he make head or tail of them. And this is why,
perhaps, none of them understand to this day either the functions of
the spleen, the physical vehicle of the Protean Double, or those of a
certain organ on the right side of man, the seat of the above-mentioned
desires, nor yet does he know anything of the pineal gland, which he
describes as a horny gland with a little sand in it, which gland is
in truth the very seat of the highest and divinest consciousness in
man, his omniscient, spiritual and all-embracing mind. And this shows
to you still more plainly that we have neither invented these seven
principles, nor are they new in the world of philosophy, as we can
easily prove.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what is it that reincarnates, in
your belief?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The Spiritual thinking Ego, the
permanent principle in man, or that which is the seat of <i>Manas</i>. It is
not Atma, or even Atma-Buddhi, regarded as the dual <i>Monad</i>, which is
the <i>individual</i>, or <i>divine</i> man, but Manas; for Atman is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Universal <span class="smcap">All</span>, and becomes the <span class="smcap">Higher-Self</span> of man only in conjunction with
<i>Buddhi</i>, its vehicle, which links <span class="smcap">IT</span> to
the individuality (or divine man). For it is the Buddhi-Manas which
is called the <i>Causal body</i>, (the United 5th and 6th Principles) and
which is <i>Consciousness</i>, that connects it with every personality it
inhabits on earth. Therefore, Soul being a generic term, there are
in men three <i>aspects</i> of soul—the terrestrial, or animal; the Human
Soul; and the Spiritual Soul; these, strictly speaking, are one Soul
in its three aspects. Now of the first aspect, nothing remains after
death; of the second (<i>nous</i> or Manas) only its divine essence <i>if
left unsoiled</i> survives, while the third in addition to being immortal
becomes <i>consciously</i> divine, by the assimilation of the higher Manas.
But to make it clear, we have to say a few words first of all about
Re-incarnation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You will do well, as it is against
this doctrine that your enemies fight the most ferociously.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You mean the Spiritualists? I know;
and many are the absurd objections laboriously spun by them over the
pages of <i>Light</i>. So obtuse and malicious are some of them, that they
will stop at nothing. One of them found recently a contradiction, which
he gravely discusses in a letter to that journal, in two statements
picked out of Mr. Sinnett’s lectures. He discovers that grave
contradiction in these two sentences: “Premature returns to earth-life
in the cases when they occur may be due to Karmic complication
...”; and “there is no <i>accident</i> in the supreme act of divine
justice guiding evolution.” So profound a thinker would surely see a
contradiction of the law of gravitation if a man stretched out his hand
to stop a falling stone from crushing the head of a child!

<h2>VIII. <br>ON RE-INCARNATION OR REBIRTH.</h2></div>
<h3>WHAT IS MEMORY ACCORDING TO THEOSOPHICAL TEACHING?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> The most difficult thing for you to
do, will be to explain and give reasonable grounds for such a belief.
No Theosophist has ever yet succeeded in bringing forward a single
valid proof to shake my scepticism. First of all, you have against this
theory of re-incarnation, the fact that no single man has yet been
found to remember that he has lived, least of all who he was, during
his previous life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Your argument, I see, tends to the
same old objection; the loss of memory in each of us of our previous
incarnation. You think it invalidates our doctrine? My answer is that
it does not, and that at any rate such an objection cannot be final.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I would like to hear your
arguments.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are short and few. Yet when
you take into consideration (<i>a</i>) the utter inability of the best
modern psychologists to explain to the world the nature of <i>mind</i>;
and (<i>b</i>) their complete ignorance of its potentialities, and higher
states, you have to admit that this objection is based on an <i>a
priori</i> conclusion drawn from <i>primâ facie</i> and circumstantial
evidence more than anything else. Now what is “memory” in your
conception, pray?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> That which is generally accepted:
the faculty in our mind of remembering and of retaining the knowledge
of previous thoughts, deeds and events.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Please add to it that there
is a great difference between the three accepted forms of memory.
Besides memory in general you have <i>Remembrance</i>, <i>Recollection</i>
and <i>Reminiscence</i>, have you not? Have you ever thought over the
difference? Memory, remember, is a generic name.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet, all these are only synonyms.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Indeed, they are not—not in
philosophy, at all events. Memory is simply an innate power in thinking
beings, and even in animals, of reproducing past impressions by an
association of ideas principally suggested by objective things or
by some action on our external sensory organs. Memory is a faculty
depending entirely on the more or less healthy and normal functioning
of our <i>physical</i> brain; and <i>remembrance</i> and <i>recollection</i> are
the attributes and handmaidens of that memory. But <i>reminiscence</i> is
an entirely different thing. “Reminiscence” is defined by the modern
psychologist as something intermediate between <i>remembrance</i> and
<i>recollection</i>, or “a conscious process of recalling past occurrences,
but <i>without that full and varied reference</i> to particular things which
characterises <i>recollection</i>.” Locke, speaking of recollection and
remembrance, says: “When an <i>idea again</i> recurs without the operation
of the like object on the external sensory, it is <i>remembrance</i>; if
it be sought after by the mind, and with pain and endeavour found and
brought again into view, it is <i>recollection</i>.” But even Locke leaves
<i>reminiscence</i> without any clear definition, because it is no faculty
or attribute of our <i>physical</i> memory, but an intuitional perception
apart from and outside our physical brain; a perception which, covering
as it does (being called into action by the ever-present knowledge
of our spiritual Ego) all those visions in man which are regarded as
<i>abnormal</i>—from the pictures suggested by genius to the <i>ravings</i> of
fever and even madness—are classed by science as having no <i>existence</i>
outside of our fancy. Occultism and Theosophy, however, regard
<i>reminiscence</i> in an entirely different light. For us, while <i>memory</i>
is physical and evanescent and depends on the physiological conditions
of the brain—a fundamental proposition with all teachers of mnemonics,
who have the researches of modern scientific psychologists to back
them—we call <i>reminiscence</i> the <i>memory of the soul</i>. And it is <i>this</i>
memory which gives the assurance to almost every human being, whether
he understands it or not, of his having lived before and having to live
again. Indeed, as Wordsworth has it:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting,</span>
<span class="i2">The soul that rises with us, our life’s star,</span>
<span class="i0">Hath elsewhere had its setting,</span>
<span class="i2">And cometh from afar.”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> If it is on this kind of
memory—poetry and abnormal fancies, on your own confession—that you
base your doctrine, then you will convince very few, I am afraid.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I did not “confess” it was a fancy.
I simply said that physiologists and scientists in general regard
such reminiscences as hallucinations and fancy, to which <i>learned</i>
conclusion they are welcome. We do not deny that such visions of the
past and glimpses far back into the corridors of time, are abnormal, as
contrasted with our normal daily life experience and physical memory.
But we do maintain with Professor W. Knight, that “the absence of
memory of any action done in a previous state cannot be a conclusive
argument against our having lived through it.” And every fair-minded
opponent must agree with what is said in Butler’s <i>Lectures on
Platonic Philosophy</i>—“that the feeling of extravagance with which
it (pre-existence) affects us has its secret source in materialistic
or semi-materialistic prejudices.” Besides which we maintain that
memory, as Olympiodorus called it, is simply <i>phantasy</i>, and the most
unreliable thing in us.<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31_31">[31]</a>
Ammonius Saccas asserted that the only faculty in man directly opposed
to prognostication, or looking into futurity, is <i>memory</i>. Furthermore,
remember that memory is one thing and mind or <i>thought</i> is another; one
is a recording machine, a register which very easily gets out of order;
the other (thoughts) are eternal and imperishable. Would you refuse to
believe in the existence of certain things or men only because your
physical eyes have not seen them? Would not the collective testimony
of past generations who have seen him be a sufficient guarantee that
Julius Cæsar once lived? Why should not the same testimony of the
psychic senses of the masses be taken into consideration?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But don’t you think that these are too fine
distinctions to be accepted by the majority of mortals?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Say rather by the majority of materialists. And
to them we say, behold: even in the short span of ordinary
existence, memory is too weak to register all the events of
a lifetime. How frequently do even most important events lie
dormant in our memory until awakened by some association of
ideas, or aroused to function and activity by some other link.
This is especially the case with people of advanced age, who are
always found suffering from feebleness of recollection. When,
therefore, we remember that which we know about the physical and
the spiritual principles in man, it is not the fact that our
memory has failed to record our precedent life and lives that
ought to surprise us, but the contrary, were it to happen.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_8_2"></a>WHY DO WE NOT REMEMBER OUR PAST LIVES?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You have given me a bird’s eye view
of the seven principles; now how do they account for our complete loss
of any recollection of having lived before?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Very easily. Since those
“principles” which we call physical, and none of which is denied by
science, though it calls them by other names,<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32_32">[32]</a>
are disintegrated after death with their constituent elements,
<i>memory</i> along with its brain, this vanished memory of a vanished
personality, can neither remember nor record anything in the subsequent
re-incarnation of the <span class="smcap">Ego</span>. Re-incarnation
means that this Ego will be furnished with a <i>new</i> body, a <i>new</i> brain,
and a <i>new</i> memory. Therefore it would be as absurd to expect this
<i>memory</i> to remember that which it has never recorded as it would be
idle to examine under a microscope a shirt never worn by a murderer,
and seek on it for the stains of blood which are to be found only
on the clothes he wore. It is not the clean shirt that we have to
question, but the clothes worn during the perpetration of the crime;
and if these are burnt and destroyed, how can you get at them?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Aye! how can you get at the
certainty that the crime was ever committed at all, or that the “man in
the clean shirt” ever lived before?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not by physical processes, most
assuredly; nor by relying on the testimony of that which exists no
longer. But there is such a thing as circumstantial evidence, since
our wise laws accept it, more, perhaps, even than they should. To
get convinced of the fact of re-incarnation and past lives, one must
put oneself in <i>rapport</i> with one’s real permanent Ego, not one’s
evanescent memory.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how can people believe in that
which they <i>do not know</i>, nor have ever seen, far less put themselves
in <i>rapport</i> with it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If people, and the most learned,
will believe in the Gravity, Ether, Force, and what not of Science,
abstractions “and working hypotheses,” which they have neither seen,
touched, smelt, heard, nor tasted—why should not other people believe,
on the same principle, in one’s permanent Ego, a far more logical and
important “working hypothesis” than any other?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is, finally, this mysterious
eternal principle? Can you explain its nature so as to make it
comprehensible to all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The <span class="smcap">Ego</span>
which reincarnates, the <i>individual</i> and immortal —not
personal—“I”; the vehicle, in short, of the Atma-Buddhic <span class="smcap">Monad</span>, that which is rewarded in Devachan and
punished on earth, and that, finally, to which the reflection only of
the <i>Skandhas</i>, or attributes, of every incarnation attaches
itself.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33_33">[33]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean by <i>Skandhas</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just what I said: “attributes,”
among which is <i>memory</i>, all of which perish like a flower, leaving
behind them only a feeble perfume. Here is another paragraph from H. S.
Olcott’s “Buddhist Catechism”<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34_34">[34]</a>
which bears directly upon the subject. It deals with the question as
follows:—“The aged man remembers the incidents of his youth, despite
his being physically and mentally changed. Why, then, is not the
recollection of past lives brought over by us from our last birth into
the present birth? Because memory is included within the Skandhas,
and the Skandhas having changed with the new existence, a memory,
the record of that particular existence, develops. Yet the record
or reflection of all the past lives must survive, for when Prince
Siddhartha became Buddha, the full sequence of His previous births
were seen by Him ... and any one who attains to the state of <i>Jhana</i>
can thus retrospectively trace the line of his lives.” This proves
to you that while the undying qualities of the personality—such as
love, goodness, charity, etc.—attach themselves to the immortal Ego,
photographing on it, so to speak, a permanent image of the divine
aspect of the man who was, his material Skandhas (those which generate
the most marked Karmic effects) are as evanescent as a flash of
lightning, and cannot impress the new brain of the new personality;
yet their failing to do so impairs in no way the identity of the
reincarnating Ego.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you mean to infer that that which
survives is only the Soul-memory, as you call it, that Soul or Ego
being one and the same, while nothing of the personality remains?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not quite; something of each
personality, unless the latter was an <i>absolute</i> materialist with not
even a chink in his nature for a spiritual ray to pass through, must
survive, as it leaves its eternal impress on the incarnating permanent
Self or Spiritual Ego.<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35_35">[35]</a>
(See On <i>post mortem</i> and <i>post natal</i> Consciousness.)
The personality with its Skandhas is ever changing with every new
birth. It is, as said before, only the part played by the actor (the
true Ego) for one night. This is why we preserve no memory on the
physical plane of our past lives, though the <i>real</i> “Ego” has lived
them over and knows them all.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then how does it happen that the
real or Spiritual man does not impress his new personal “I” with this
knowledge?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> How is it that the servant-girls
in a poor farm-house could speak Hebrew and play the violin in their
trance or somnambulic state, and knew neither when in their normal
condition? Because, as every genuine psychologist of the old, not your
modern, school, will tell you, the Spiritual Ego can act only when
the personal Ego is paralysed. The Spiritual “I” in man is omniscient
and has every knowledge innate in it; while the personal self is the
creature of its environment and the slave of the physical memory. Could
the former manifest itself uninterruptedly, and without impediment,
there would be no longer men on earth, but we should all be gods.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Still there ought to be exceptions,
and some ought to remember.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And so there are. But who
believes in their report? Such sensitives are generally regarded as
hallucinated hysteriacs, as crack-brained enthusiasts, or humbugs, by
modern materialism. Let them read, however, works on this subject,
pre-eminently “Re-incarnation, a Study of Forgotten Truth” by E. D.
Walker, F.T.S., and see in it the mass of proofs which the able author
brings to bear on this vexed question. One speaks to people of soul,
and some ask “What is Soul?” “Have you ever proved its existence?” Of
course it is useless to argue with those who are materialists. But even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to them I would put the question: “Can you remember what you were or
did when a baby? Have you preserved the smallest recollection of your
life, thoughts, or deeds, or that you lived at all during the first
eighteen months or two years of your existence? Then why not deny that
you have ever lived as a babe, on the same principle?” When to all this
we add that the reincarnating Ego, or <i>individuality</i>, retains during
the Devachanic period merely the essence of the experience of its past
earth-life or personality, the whole physical experience involving into
a state of <i>in potentia</i>, or being, so to speak, translated into
spiritual formulæ; when we remember further that the term between two
rebirths is said to extend from ten to fifteen centuries, during which
time the physical consciousness is totally and absolutely inactive,
having no organs to act through and therefore <i>no existence</i>, the
reason for the absence of all remembrance in the purely physical memory
is apparent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You just said that the
<span class="smcap">Spiritual Ego</span> was omniscient. Where, then, is
that vaunted omniscience during his Devachanic life, as you call it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> During that time it is latent
and potential, because first of all, the Spiritual Ego (the compound
of Buddhi-Manas) is <i>not</i> the Higher <span class="smcap">Self</span>,
which being one with the Universal Soul or Mind is alone omniscient;
and, secondly, because Devachan is the idealized continuation of the
terrestrial life just left behind, a period of retributive adjustment,
and a reward for unmerited wrongs and sufferings undergone in that
special life. It is omniscient only <i>potentially</i> in Devachan, and <i>de
facto</i> exclusively in Nirvana, when the Ego is merged in the Universal
Mind-Soul. Yet it re-becomes <i>quasi</i> omniscient during those hours on
earth when certain abnormal conditions and physiological changes in
the body make the <i>Ego</i> free from the trammels of matter. Thus the
examples cited above of somnambulists, a poor servant speaking Hebrew,
and another playing the violin, give you an illustration of the case
in point. This does not mean that the explanations of these two facts
offered us by medical science have no truth in them, for one girl had,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
years before, heard her master, a clergyman, read Hebrew works aloud,
and the other had heard an artist playing a violin at their farm.
But neither could have done so as perfectly as they did had they not
been ensouled by <span class="smcap">THAT</span> which, owing to the
sameness of its nature with the Universal Mind, is omniscient. Here the
higher principle acted on the Skandhas and moved them; in the other,
the personality being paralysed, the individuality manifested itself.
Pray do not confuse the two.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_8_3"></a>ON INDIVIDUALITY AND
PERSONALITY.<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36_36">[36]</a></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what is the difference between
the two? I confess that I am still in the dark. Indeed it is just that
difference, then, that you cannot impress too much on our minds.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I try to; but alas, it is
harder with some than to make them feel a reverence for childish
impossibilities, only because they are <i>orthodox</i>, and because
orthodoxy is respectable. To understand the idea well, you have to
first study the dual sets of “principles”; the <i>spiritual</i>, or those
which belong to the imperishable Ego; and the <i>material</i>, or those
principles which make up the ever-changing bodies or the series of
personalities of that Ego. Let us fix permanent names to these, and say
that:—</p>
<p class="blockquot3">I. Atma, the “Higher Self,” is neither your
Spirit nor mine, but like sunlight shines on all. It is the universally
diffused “<i>divine principle</i>,” and is inseparable from its one and
absolute <i>Meta</i>-Spirit, as the sunbeam is inseparable from sunlight.</p>
<p class="blockquot3">II. <i>Buddhi</i> (the spiritual soul) is only its
vehicle. Neither each separately, nor the two collectively, are of
any more use to the body of man, then sunlight and its beams are for
a mass of granite buried in the earth, <i>unless the divine Duad is
assimilated by, and reflected in</i>, some <i>consciousness</i>. Neither Atma
nor Buddhi are ever reached by Karma, because the former is the highest
aspect of Karma, <i>its working agent</i> of ITSELF in one aspect, and the
other is unconscious <i>on this plane</i>. This consciousness or mind is,</p>
<p class="blockquot3">III. <i>Manas</i>,<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37_37">[37]</a>
the derivation or product in a reflected form of <i>Ahamkara</i>, “the
conception of I,” or <span class="smcap">Ego-ship</span>. It is,
therefore, when inseparably united to the first two, called the <span class="smcap">Spiritual Ego</span>, and <i>Taijasi</i> (the radiant).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p class="no-indent">This is the real Individuality, or the divine man.
It is this Ego which—having originally incarnated in the <i>senseless</i>
human form animated by, but unconscious (since it had no consciousness)
of, the presence in itself of the dual monad—made of that human-like
form <i>a real man</i>. It is that Ego, that “Causal Body,” which
overshadows every personality Karma forces it to incarnate into; and
this Ego which is held responsible for all the sins committed through,
and in, every new body or personality—the evanescent masks which hide
the true Individual through the long series of rebirths.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is this just? Why should this
<span class="smcap">Ego</span> receive punishment as the result of
deeds which it has forgotten?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It has not forgotten them; it
knows and remembers its misdeeds as well as you remember what you have
done yesterday. Is it because the memory of that bundle of physical
compounds called “body” does not recollect what its predecessor (the
personality <i>that was</i>) did, that you imagine that the real Ego has
forgotten them? As well say it is unjust that the new boots on the feet
of a boy, who is flogged for stealing apples, should be punished for
that which they know nothing of.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But are there no modes of
communication between the Spiritual and human consciousness or
memory?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Of course there are; but they
have never been recognised by your scientific modern psychologists.
To what do you attribute intuition, the “voice of the conscience,”
premonitions, vague undefined reminiscences, etc., etc., if not to such
communications? Would that the majority of educated men, at least, had
the fine spiritual perceptions of Coleridge, who shows how intuitional
he is in some of his comments. Hear what he says with respect to the
probability that “all thoughts are in themselves imperishable.” “If the
intelligent faculty (sudden ‘revivals’ of memory) should be rendered
more comprehensive, it would require only a different and appropriate
organization, the <i>body celestial</i> instead of the <i>body terrestrial</i>,
to bring before every human soul <i>the collective experience of its
whole past existence</i> (<i>existences</i>, rather).” And this <i>body
celestial</i> is our Manasic <span class="smcap">Ego</span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_8_4"></a>ON THE REWARD AND PUNISHMENT OF THE EGO.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have heard you say that the <i>Ego</i>,
whatever the life of the person he incarnated in may have been on
Earth, is never visited with <i>post-mortem</i> punishment.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Never, save in very exceptional
and rare cases of which we will not speak here, as the nature of the
“punishment” in no way approaches any of your theological conceptions
of damnation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if it is punished in this life
for the misdeeds committed in a previous one, then it is this Ego that
ought to be rewarded also, whether here, or when disincarnated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And so it is. If we do not admit of
any punishment outside of this earth, it is because the only state the
Spiritual Self knows of, hereafter, is that of unalloyed bliss.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply this: <i>crimes and sins
committed on a plane of objectivity and in a world of matter, cannot
receive punishment in a world of pure subjectivity</i>. We believe in no
hell or paradise as localities; in no objective hell-fires and worms
that never die, nor in any Jerusalems with streets paved with sapphires
and diamonds. What we believe in is a <i>post-mortem state</i> or mental
condition, such as we are in during a vivid dream. We believe in an
immutable law of absolute Love, Justice, and Mercy. And believing in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
it, we say: “Whatever the sin and dire results of the original Karmic
transgression of the now incarnated Egos<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38_38">[38]</a>
no man (or the outer material and periodical form of the Spiritual
Entity) can be held, with any degree of justice, responsible for the
consequences of his birth. He does not ask to be born, nor can he
choose the parents that will give him life. In every respect he is a
victim to his environment, the child of circumstances over which he
has no control; and if each of his transgressions were impartially
investigated, there would be found nine out of every ten cases when he
was the one sinned against, rather than the sinner. Life is at best a
heartless play, a stormy sea to cross, and a heavy burden often too
difficult to bear. The greatest philosophers have tried in vain to
fathom and find out its <i>raison d’être</i>, and have all failed except
those who had the key to it, namely, the Eastern sages. Life is, as
Shakespeare describes it:—</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">... but a walking shadow—a poor player,</span>
<span class="i0">That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</span>
<span class="i0">And then is heard no more. It is a tale</span>
<span class="i0">Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</span>
<span class="i0">Signifying nothing....”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="no-indent"> Nothing in its separate parts, yet of the
greatest importance in its collectivity or series of lives. At any
rate, almost every individual life is, in its full development, a
sorrow. And are we to believe that poor, helpless men, after being
tossed about like a piece of rotten timber on the angry billows of
life, is, if he proves too weak to resist them, to be punished by a
<i>sempiternity</i> of damnation, or even a temporary punishment? Never!
Whether a great or an average sinner, good or bad, guilty or innocent,
once delivered of the burden of physical life, the tired and worn-out
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<i>Manu</i> (“thinking Ego”) has won the right to a period of absolute rest
and bliss. The same unerringly wise and just rather than merciful
Law, which inflicts upon the incarnated Ego the Karmic punishment
for every sin committed during the preceding life on Earth, provided
for the now disembodied Entity a long lease of mental rest, <i>i.e.</i>,
the entire oblivion of every sad event, aye, to the smallest painful
thought, that took place in its last life as a personality, leaving in
the soul-memory but the reminiscence of that which was bliss, or led
to happiness. Plotinus, who said that our body was the true river of
Lethe, for “souls plunged into it forget all,” meant more than he said.
For, as our terrestrial body is like Lethe, so is our <i>celestial body</i>
in Devachan, and much more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then am I to understand that the
murderer, the transgressor of law divine and human in every shape, is
allowed to go unpunished?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Who ever said that? Our philosophy
has a doctrine of punishment as stern as that of the most rigid
Calvinist, only far more philosophical and consistent with absolute
justice. No deed, not even a sinful thought, will go unpunished; the
latter more severely even than the former, as a thought is far more
potential in creating evil results than even a
deed.<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39_39">[39]</a>
We believe in an unerring law of Retribution, called <span class="smcap">Karma</span>, which asserts itself in a natural
concatenation of causes and their unavoidable results.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And how, or where, does it act?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Every labourer is worthy of his
hire, saith Wisdom in the Gospel; every action, good or bad, is a
prolific parent, saith the Wisdom of the Ages. Put the two together,
and you will find the “why.” After allowing the Soul, escaped from the
pangs of personal life, a sufficient, aye, a hundredfold compensation,
Karma, with its army of Skandhas, waits at the threshold of Devachan,
whence the <i>Ego</i> re-emerges to assume a new incarnation. It is at this
moment that the future destiny of the now-rested Ego trembles in the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
scales of just Retribution, as <i>it</i> now falls once again under the
sway of active Karmic law. It is in this re-birth which is ready for
<i>it</i>, a re-birth selected and prepared by this mysterious, inexorable,
but in the equity and wisdom of its decrees infallible LAW, that the
sins of the previous life of the Ego are punished. Only it is into
no imaginary Hell, with theatrical flames and ridiculous tailed and
horned devils, that the Ego is cast, but verily on to this earth, the
plane and region of his sins, where he will have to atone for every
bad thought and deed. As he has sown, so will he reap. Re-incarnation
will gather around him all those other Egos who have suffered, whether
directly or indirectly, at the hands, or even through the unconscious
instrumentality, of the past <i>personality</i>. They will be thrown by
Nemesis in the way of the <i>new</i> man, concealing the <i>old</i>, the eternal
<span class="smcap">Ego</span>, and ...</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But where is the equity you speak
of, since these <i>new</i> “personalities” are not aware of having sinned or
been sinned against?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Has the coat torn to shreds from
the back of the man who stole it, by another man who was robbed of
it and recognises his property, to be regarded as fairly dealt with?
The new “personality” is no better than a fresh suit of clothes with
its specific characteristics, colour, form and qualities; but the
<i>real</i> man who wears it is the same culprit as of old. It is the
<i>individuality</i> who suffers through his “personality.” And it is
this, and this alone, that can account for the terrible, still only
<i>apparent</i>, injustice in the distribution of lots in life to man. When
your modern philosophers will have succeeded in showing to us a good
reason, why so many apparently innocent and good men are born only
to suffer during a whole lifetime; why so many are born poor unto
starvation in the slums of great cities, abandoned by fate and men;
why, while these are born in the gutter, others open their eyes to
light in palaces; while a noble birth and fortune seem often given to
the worst of men and only rarely to the worthy; while there are beggars
whose <i>inner</i> selves are peers to the highest and noblest of men;
when this, and much more, is satisfactorily explained by either your
philosophers or theologians, then only, but not till then, you will
have the right to reject the theory of re-incarnation. The highest and
grandest of poets have dimly perceived this truth of truths. Shelley
believed in it, Shakespeare must have thought of it when writing on the
worthlessness of Birth. Remember his words:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<h2>IX. <br>ON THE KAMA-LOKA AND DEVACHAN.</h2></div>
<h3>ON THE FATE OF THE LOWER “PRINCIPLES.”</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You spoke of <i>Kama-loka</i>, what is
it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> When the man dies, his lower three
principles leave him for ever; <i>i.e.</i>, body, life, and the vehicle of
the latter, the astral body or the double of the <i>living</i> man. And
then, his four principles—the central or middle principle, the animal
soul or <i>Kama-rupa</i>, with what it has assimilated from the lower Manas,
and the higher triad find themselves in <i>Kama-loka</i>. The latter is an
astral locality, the <i>limbus</i> of scholastic theology, the <i>Hades</i> of
the ancients, and, strictly speaking, a <i>locality</i> only in a relative
sense. It has neither a definite area nor boundary, but exists <i>within</i>
subjective space; <i>i.e.</i>, is beyond our sensuous perceptions. Still it
exists, and it is there that the astral <i>eidolons</i> of all the beings
that have lived, animals included, await their <i>second death</i>. For
the animals it comes with the disintegration and the entire fading out
of their <i>astral</i> particles to the last. For the human <i>eidolon</i> it
begins when the Atma-Buddhi-Manasic triad is said to “separate” itself
from its lower principles, or the reflection of the <i>ex-personality</i>,
by falling into the Devachanic state.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what happens after this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then the <i>Kama-rupic</i> phantom,
remaining bereft of its informing thinking principle, the higher
<i>Manas</i>, and the lower aspect of the latter, the animal intelligence,
no longer receiving light from the higher mind, and no longer having a
physical brain to work through, collapses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> In what way?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Well, it falls into the state
of the frog when certain portions of its brain are taken out by the
vivisector. It can think no more, even on the lowest animal plane.
Henceforth it is no longer even the lower Manas, since this “lower” is
nothing without the “higher.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And is it <i>this</i> nonentity which we
find materializing in Séance rooms with Mediums?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is this nonentity. A true
nonentity, however, only as to reasoning or cogitating powers, still an
<i>Entity</i>, however astral and fluidic, as shown in certain cases when,
having been magnetically and unconsciously drawn toward a medium, it
is revived for a time and lives in him by <i>proxy</i>, so to speak. This
“spook,” or the Kama-rupa, may be compared with the <i>jelly-fish</i>,
which has an ethereal gelatinous appearance so long as it is in its
own element, or water (the <i>medium’s specific AURA</i>), but which, no
sooner is it thrown out of it, than it dissolves in the hand or on the
sand, especially in sunlight. In the medium’s Aura, it lives a kind of
vicarious life and reasons and speaks either through the medium’s brain
or those of other persons present. But this would lead us too far, and
upon other people’s grounds, whereon I have no desire to trespass. Let
us keep to the subject of re-incarnation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What of the latter? How long does
the incarnating <i>Ego</i> remain in the Devachanic state?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This, we are taught, depends
on the degree of spirituality and the merit or demerit of the last
incarnation. The average time is from ten to fifteen centuries, as I
already told you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why could not this Ego manifest
and communicate with mortals as Spiritualists will have it? What is
there to prevent a mother from communicating with the children she left
on earth, a husband with his wife, and so on? It is a most consoling
belief, I must confess; nor do I wonder that those who believe in it
are so averse to give it up.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Nor are they forced to, unless
they happen to prefer truth to fiction, however “consoling.”
Uncongenial our doctrines may be to Spiritualists; yet, nothing of
what we believe in and teach is half as selfish and cruel as what they preach.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I do not understand you. What is selfish?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Their doctrine of the return of
Spirits, the real “personalities” as they say; and I will tell you
why. If <i>Devachan</i>—call it “paradise” if you like, a “place of bliss
and of supreme felicity,” if it is anything—is such a place (or say
<i>state</i>), logic tells us that no sorrow or even a shade of pain can be
experienced therein. “God shall wipe away all the tears from the eyes”
of those in paradise, we read in the book of many promises. And if the
“Spirits of the dead” are enabled to return and see all that is going
on on earth, and especially <i>in their homes</i>, what kind of bliss can be
in store for them?</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_9_2"></a>WHY THEOSOPHISTS DO NOT
BELIEVE IN THE<br> RETURN OF PURE “SPIRITS.”</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean? Why should this
interfere with their bliss?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply this; and here is
an instance. A mother dies, leaving behind her little helpless
children—orphans whom she adores—perhaps a beloved husband also. We
say that her “<i>Spirit</i>” or <i>Ego</i>—that individuality which is now
all impregnated, for the entire Devachanic period, with the noblest
feelings held by its late <i>personality</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, love for her children,
pity for those who suffer, and so on—we say that it is now entirely
separated from the “vale of tears,” that its future bliss consists in
that blessed ignorance of all the woes it left behind. Spiritualists
say, on the contrary, that it is as vividly aware of them, <i>and more
so than before</i>, for “Spirits see more than mortals in the flesh do.”
We say that the bliss of the <i>Devachanee</i> consists in its complete
conviction that it has never left the earth, and that there is no such
thing as death at all; that the <i>post-mortem</i> spiritual <i>consciousness</i>
of the mother will represent to her that she lives surrounded by her
children and all those whom she loved; that no gap, no link, will be
missing to make her disembodied state the most perfect and absolute
happiness. The Spiritualists deny this point blank. According to their
doctrine, unfortunate man is not liberated even by death from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
sorrows of this life. Not a drop from the life-cup of pain and
suffering will miss his lips; and <i>nolens volens</i>, since he sees
everything now, shall he drink it to the bitter dregs. Thus, the loving
wife, who during her lifetime was ready to save her husband sorrow
at the price of her heart’s blood, is now doomed to see, in utter
helplessness, his despair, and to register every hot tear he sheds
for her loss. Worse than that, she may see the tears dry too soon,
and another beloved face shine on him, the father of her children;
find another woman replacing her in his affections; doomed to hear
her orphans giving the holy name of “mother” to one indifferent to
them, and to see those little children neglected, if not ill-treated.
According to this doctrine the “gentle wafting to immortal life”
becomes without any transition the way into a new path of mental
suffering! And yet, the columns of the “Banner of Light,” the veteran
journal of the American Spiritualists, are filled with messages from
the dead, the “dear departed ones,” who all write to say how very
<i>happy</i> they are! Is such a state of knowledge consistent with bliss?
Then “bliss” stands in such a case for the greatest curse, and orthodox
damnation must be a relief in comparison to it!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how does your theory avoid
this? How can you reconcile the theory of Soul’s omniscience with its
blindness to that which is taking place on earth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because such is the law of love
and mercy. During every Devachanic period the Ego, omniscient as it
is <i>per se</i>, clothes itself, so to say, with the <i>reflection</i> of
the “personality” that was. I have just told you that the <i>ideal</i>
efflorescence of all the abstract, therefore undying and eternal
qualities or attributes, such as love and mercy, the love of the good,
the true and the beautiful, that ever spoke in the heart of the living
“personality,” clung after death to the Ego, and therefore followed
it to Devachan. For the time being, then, the Ego becomes the ideal
reflection of the human being it was when last on earth, and <i>that</i> is
not omniscient. Were it that, it would never be in the state we call
Devachan at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are your reasons for it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If you want an answer on the strict
lines of our philosophy, then I will say that it is because everything
is <i>illusion</i> (<i>Maya</i>) outside of eternal truth, which has neither
form, colour, nor limitation. He who has placed himself beyond the
veil of maya—and such are the highest Adepts and Initiates—can have no
Devachan. As to the ordinary mortal, his bliss in it is complete. It is
an <i>absolute</i> oblivion of all that gave it pain or sorrow in the past
incarnation, and even oblivion of the fact that such things as pain
or sorrow exist at all. The <i>Devachanee</i> lives its intermediate cycle
between two incarnations surrounded by everything it had aspired to in
vain, and in the companionship of everyone it loved on earth. It has
reached the fulfilment of all its soul-yearnings. And thus it lives
throughout long centuries an existence of <i>unalloyed</i> happiness, which
is the reward for its sufferings in earth-life. In short, it bathes in
a sea of uninterrupted felicity spanned only by events of still greater
felicity in degree.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this is more than simple
delusion, it is an existence of insane hallucinations!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> From your standpoint it may be, not
so from that of philosophy. Besides which, is not our whole terrestrial
life filled with such delusions? Have you never met men and women
living for years in a fool’s paradise? And because you should happen to
learn that the husband of a wife, whom she adores and believes herself
as beloved by him, is untrue to her, would you go and break her heart
and beautiful dream by rudely awakening her to the reality? I think
not. I say it again, such oblivion and <i>hallucination</i>—if you call it
so—are only a merciful law of nature and strict justice. At any rate,
it is a far more fascinating prospect than the orthodox golden harp
with a pair of wings. The assurance that “the soul that lives ascends
frequently and runs familiarly through the streets of the heavenly
Jerusalem, visiting the patriarchs and prophets, saluting the apostles,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and admiring the army of martyrs” may seem of a more pious character
to some. Nevertheless, it is a hallucination of a far more delusive
character, since mothers love their children with an immortal love, we
all know, while the personages mentioned in the “heavenly Jerusalem”
are still of a rather doubtful nature. But I would, still, rather
accept the “new Jerusalem,” with its streets paved like the show
windows of a jeweller’s shop, than find consolation in the heartless
doctrine of the Spiritualists. The idea alone that the <i>intellectual
conscious souls</i> of one’s father, mother, daughter or brother find
their bliss in a “Summer land”—only a little more natural, but just as
ridiculous as the “New Jerusalem” in its description—would be enough
to make one lose every respect for one’s “departed ones.” To believe
that a pure spirit can feel happy while doomed to witness the sins,
mistakes, treachery, and, above all, the sufferings of those from whom
it is severed by death and whom it loves best, without being able to
help them, would be a maddening thought.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> There is something in your argument.
I confess to having never seen it in this light.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just so, and one must be selfish
to the core and utterly devoid of the sense of retributive justice, to
have ever imagined such a thing. We are with those whom we have lost
in material form, and far, far nearer to them now, than when they were
alive. And it is not only in the fancy of the <i>Devachanee</i>, as some may
imagine, but in reality. For pure divine love is not merely the blossom
of a human heart, but has its roots in eternity. Spiritual holy love
is immortal, and Karma brings sooner or later all those who loved each
other with such a spiritual affection to incarnate once more in the
same family group. Again we say that love beyond the grave, illusion
though you may call it, has a magic and divine potency which reacts
on the living. A mother’s <i>Ego</i> filled with love for the imaginary
children it sees near itself, living a life of happiness, as real to
<i>it</i> as when on earth—that love will always be felt by the children in
flesh. It will manifest in their dreams, and often in various events—in
<i>providential</i> protections and escapes, for love is a strong shield,
and is not limited by space or time. As with this Devachanic “mother,”
so with the rest of human relationships and attachments, save the
purely selfish or material. Analogy will suggest to you the rest.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> In no case, then, do you admit the
possibility of the communication of the living with the <i>disembodied</i>
spirit?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Yes, there is a case, and even two
exceptions to the rule. The first exception is during the few days
that follow immediately the death of a person and before the <i>Ego</i>
passes into the Devachanic state. Whether any living mortal, save a
few exceptional cases—(when the intensity of the desire in the dying
person to return for some purpose forced the higher consciousness <i>to
remain awake</i>, and therefore it was really the <i>individuality</i>, the
“Spirit” that communicated)—has derived much benefit from the return
of the spirit into the <i>objective</i> plane is another question. The
spirit is dazed after death and falls very soon into what we call
“<i>pre-devachanic</i> unconsciousness.” The second exception is found in
the <i>Nirmanakayas</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What about them? And what does the
name mean for you?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is the name given to those
who, though they have won the right to Nirvana and cyclic rest—(<i>not</i>
“Devachan,” as the latter is an illusion of our consciousness, a happy
dream, and as those who are fit for Nirvana must have lost entirely
every desire or possibility of the world’s illusions)—have out of pity
for mankind and those they left on earth renounced the Nirvanic state.
Such an adept, or Saint, or whatever you may call him, believing it
a selfish act to rest in bliss while mankind groans under the burden
of misery produced by ignorance, renounces Nirvana, and determines
to remain invisible <i>in spirit</i> on this earth. They have no material
body, as they have left it behind; but otherwise they remain with all
their principles even <i>in astral life</i> in our sphere. And such can and
do communicate with a few elect ones, only surely not with <i>ordinary</i> mediums.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have put you the question about
<i>Nirmanakayas</i> because I read in some German and other works that it
was the name given to the terrestrial appearances or bodies assumed by
Buddhas in the Northern Buddhistic teachings.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> So they are, only the Orientalists
have confused this terrestrial body by understanding it to be
<i>objective</i> and <i>physical</i> instead of purely astral and subjective.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what good can they do on
earth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not much, as regards individuals,
as they have no right to interfere with Karma, and can only advise
and inspire mortals for the general good. Yet they do more beneficent
actions than you imagine.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> To this Science would never
subscribe, not even modern psychology. For them, no portion of
intelligence can survive the physical brain. What would you answer
them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I would not even go to the trouble
of answering, but would simply say, in the words given to “M.A. Oxon,”
“Intelligence is perpetuated after the body is dead. Though it is not
a question of the brain only.... It is reasonable to propound the
indestructibility of the human spirit from what we know” (<i>Spirit
Identity</i>, p. 69).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But “M.A. Oxon” is a
Spiritualist?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Quite so, and the only <i>true</i>
Spiritualist I know of, though we may still disagree with him on many
a minor question. Apart from this, no Spiritualist comes nearer to the
occult truths than he does. Like any one of us he speaks incessantly
“of the surface dangers that beset the ill-equipped, feather-headed
muddler with the occult, who crosses the threshold without counting the
cost.”<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40_40">[40]</a>
Our only disagreement rests in the question of “Spirit Identity.”
Otherwise, I, for one, coincide almost entirely with him, and accept
the three propositions he embodied in his address of July, 1884. It is
this eminent Spiritualist, rather, who disagrees with us, not we with him.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are these propositions?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span></p>
<p class="blockquot3">“1. That there is a life coincident
with, and independent of the physical life of the body.”</p>
<p class="blockquot3">“2. That, as a necessary corollary, this life
extends beyond the life of the body” (we say it extends throughout
Devachan).</p>
<p class="blockquot3">“3. That there is communication between the
denizens of that state of existence and those of the world in which we
now live.”</p>
<p class="no-indent">All depend, you see, on the minor and secondary aspects of these
fundamental propositions. Everything depends on the views we take of
Spirit and Soul, or <i>Individuality</i> and <i>Personality</i>. Spiritualists
confuse the two “into one”; we separate them, and say that, with the
exceptions above enumerated, no <i>Spirit</i> will revisit the earth, though
the animal Soul may. But let us return once more to our direct subject,
the Skandhas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I begin to understand better now.
It is the Spirit, so to say, of those Skandhas which are the most
ennobling, which, attaching themselves to the incarnating Ego, survive,
and are added to the stock of its angelic experiences. And it is the
attributes connected with the material Skandhas, with selfish and
personal motives, which, disappearing from the field of action between
two incarnations, reappear at the subsequent incarnation as Karmic
results to be atoned for; and therefore the Spirit will not leave
Devachan. Is it so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Very nearly so. If you add to this
that the law of retribution, or Karma, rewarding the highest and most
spiritual in Devachan, never fails to reward them again on earth by
giving them a further development, and furnishing the Ego with a body
fitted for it, then you will be quite correct.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_9_3"></a>A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE SKANDHAS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What becomes of the other, the lower
Skandhas of the personality, after the death of the body? Are they
quite destroyed?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are and yet they are not—a
fresh metaphysical and occult mystery for you. They are destroyed as
the working stock in hand of the personality; they remain as <i>Karmic
effects</i>, as germs, hanging in the atmosphere of the terrestrial
plane, ready to come to life, as so many avenging fiends, to attach
themselves to the new personality of the Ego when it reincarnates.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This really passes my comprehension,
and is very difficult to understand.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not once that you have assimilated
all the details. For then you will see that for logic, consistency,
profound philosophy, divine mercy and equity, this doctrine of
Re-incarnation has not its equal on earth. It is a belief in a
perpetual progress for each incarnating Ego, or divine soul, in an
evolution from the outward into the inward, from the material to the
Spiritual, arriving at the end of each stage at absolute unity with the
divine Principle. From strength to strength, from beauty and perfection
of one plane to the greater beauty and perfection of another, with
accessions of new glory, of fresh knowledge and power in each cycle,
such is the destiny of every Ego, which thus becomes its own Saviour in
each world and incarnation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But Christianity teaches the same.
It also preaches progression.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Yes, only with the addition of
something else. It tells us of the <i>impossibility</i> of attaining
Salvation without the aid of a miraculous Saviour, and therefore dooms
to perdition all those who will not accept the dogma. This is just
the difference between Christian theology and Theosophy. The former
enforces belief in the Descent of the Spiritual Ego into the <i>Lower
Self</i> the latter inculcates the necessity of endeavouring to elevate
oneself to the Christos, or Buddhi state.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> By teaching the annihilation of
consciousness in case of failure, however, don’t you think that
it amounts to the annihilation of <i>Self</i>, in the opinion of the
non-metaphysical?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> From the standpoint of those who
believe in the resurrection of the body <i>literally</i>, and insist that
every bone, every artery and atom of flesh will be raised bodily on
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the Judgment Day—of course it does. If you still insist that it is the
perishable form and finite qualities that make up <i>immortal</i> man, then
we shall hardly understand each other. And if you do not understand
that, by limiting the existence of every Ego to one life on earth, you
make of Deity an ever-drunken Indra of the Puranic dead letter, a cruel
Moloch, a god who makes an inextricable mess on Earth, and yet claims
thanks for it, then the sooner we drop the conversation the better.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But let us return, now that the
subject of the Skandhas is disposed of, to the question of the
consciousness which survives death. This is the point which interests
most people. Do we possess more knowledge in Devachan than we do in
Earth life?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In one sense, we can acquire more
knowledge; that is, we can develop further any faculty which we loved
and strove after during life, provided it is concerned with abstract
and ideal things, such as music, painting, poetry, etc., since Devachan
is merely an idealized and subjective continuation of earth-life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if in Devachan the Spirit is
free from matter, why should it not possess all knowledge?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because, as I told you, the Ego is,
so to say, wedded to the memory of its last incarnation. Thus, if you
think over what I have said, and string all the facts together, you
will realize that the Devachanic state is not one of omniscience, but a
transcendental continuation of the personal life just terminated. It is
the rest of the soul from the toils of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But the scientific materialists
assert that after the death of man nothing remains; that the human body
simply disintegrates into its component elements; and that what we call
soul is merely a temporary self-consciousness produced as a bye-product
of organic action, which will evaporate like steam. Is not theirs a
strange state of mind?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not strange at all, that I see.
If they say that self-consciousness ceases with the body, then in
their case they simply utter an unconscious prophecy, for once they
are firmly convinced of what they assert, no conscious after-life is
possible for them. For there <i>are</i> exceptions to every rule.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_9_4"></a>ON POST-MORTEM AND POST-NATAL
CONSCIOUSNESS.<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41_41">[41]</a></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if human self-consciousness
survives death as a rule, why should there be exceptions?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In the fundamental principles of
the spiritual world no exception is possible. But there are rules for
those who see, and rules for those who prefer to remain blind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Quite so, I understand. This is but
an aberration of the blind man, who denies the existence of the sun
because he does not see it. But after death his spiritual eyes will
certainly compel him to see. Is this what you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> He will not be compelled, nor will
he see anything. Having persistently denied during life the continuance
of existence after death, he will be unable to see it, because his
spiritual capacity having been stunted in life, it cannot develop after
death, and he will remain blind. By insisting that he <i>must</i> see it,
you evidently mean one thing and I another. You speak of the spirit
from the spirit, or the flame from the flame—of Atma, in short—and you
confuse it with the human soul—Manas.... You do not understand me; let
me try to make it clear. The whole gist of your question is to know
whether, in the case of a downright materialist, the complete loss of
self-consciousness and self-perception after death is possible? Isn’t
it so? I answer, It is possible. Because, believing firmly in our
Esoteric Doctrine, which refers to the <i>post-mortem</i> period, or the
interval between two lives or births as merely a transitory state, I
say, whether that interval between two acts of the illusionary drama of
life lasts one year or a million, that <i>post-mortem</i> state may, without
any breach of the fundamental law, prove to be just the same state as
that of a man who is in a dead faint.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But since you have just said that
the fundamental laws of the after death state admit of no exceptions,
how can this be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Nor do I say that it does admit
of an exception. But the spiritual law of continuity applies only
to things which are truly real. To one who has read and understood
Mundakya Upanishad and Vedanta-Sara all this becomes very clear. I will
say more: it is sufficient to understand what we mean by Buddhi and
the duality of Manas to gain a clear perception why the materialist
may fail to have a self-conscious survival after death. Since Manas,
in its lower aspect, is the seat of the terrestrial mind, it can,
therefore, give only that perception of the Universe which is based on
the evidence of that mind; it cannot give spiritual vision. It is said
in the Eastern school, that between Buddhi and Manas (the <i>Ego</i>), or
Iswara and Pragna<a id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42_42">[42]</a>
there is in reality no more difference than <i>between a
forest and its trees, a lake and its waters</i>, as the Mundakya
teaches. One or hundreds of trees dead from loss of vitality, or
uprooted, are yet incapable of preventing the forest from being
still a forest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But, as I understand it, Buddhi
represents in this simile the forest, and
Manas-taijasi<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43_43">[43]</a>
the trees. And if Buddhi is immortal, how can that which is similar to
it, <i>i.e.</i>, Manas-taijasi, entirely lose its consciousness till the day
of its new incarnation? I cannot understand it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You cannot, because you will mix
up an abstract representation of the whole with its casual changes
of form. Remember that if it can be said of Buddhi-Manas that it is
unconditionally immortal, the same cannot be said of the lower Manas,
still less of Taijasi, which is merely an attribute. Neither of these,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
neither Manas nor Taijasi, can exist apart from Buddhi, the divine
soul, because the first (<i>Manas</i>) is, in its lower aspect, a
qualificative attribute of the terrestrial personality, and the second
(<i>Taijasi</i>) is identical with the first, because it is the same Manas
only with the light of Buddhi reflected on it. In its turn, Buddhi
would remain only an impersonal spirit without this element which it
borrows from the human soul, which conditions and makes of it, in this
illusive Universe, <i>as it were something separate</i> from the universal
soul for the whole period of the cycle of incarnation. Say rather that
<i>Buddhi-Manas</i> can neither die nor lose its compound self-consciousness
in Eternity, nor the recollection of its previous incarnations in which
the two—<i>i.e</i>, the spiritual and the human soul—had been closely linked
together. But it is not so in the case of a materialist, whose human
soul not only receives nothing from the divine soul, but even refuses
to recognise its existence. You can hardly apply this axiom to the
attributes and qualifications of the human soul, for it would be like
saying that because your divine soul is immortal, therefore the bloom
on your cheek must also be immortal; whereas this bloom, like Taijasi,
is simply a transitory phenomenon.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do I understand you to say that we
must not mix in our minds the noumenon with the phenomenon, the cause
with its effect?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I do say so, and repeat that,
limited to Manas or the human soul alone, the radiance of Taijasi
itself becomes a mere question of time; because both immortality and
consciousness after death become, for the terrestrial personality
of man, simply conditioned attributes, as they depend entirely on
conditions and beliefs created by the human soul itself during the life
of its body. Karma acts incessantly; we reap <i>in our after-life</i> only
the fruit of that which we have ourselves sown in this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if my Ego can, after the
destruction of my body, become plunged in a state of entire
unconsciousness, then where can be the punishment for the sins of my
past life?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Our philosophy teaches that Karmic punishment
reaches Ego only in its next incarnation. After death it receives only
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the reward for the unmerited sufferings endured during its past
incarnation.<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44_44">[44]</a>
The whole punishment after death, even for the materialist, consists,
therefore, in the absence of any reward, and the utter loss of the
consciousness of one’s bliss and rest. Karma is the child of the
terrestrial Ego, the fruit of the actions of the tree which is the
objective personality visible to all, as much as the fruit of all the
thoughts and even motives of the spiritual “I”; but Karma is also
the tender mother, who heals the wounds inflicted by her during the
preceding life, before she will begin to torture this Ego by inflicting
upon him new ones. If it may be said that there is not a mental or
physical suffering in the life of a mortal which is not the direct
fruit and consequence of some sin in a preceding existence; on the
other hand, since he does not preserve the slightest recollection of it
in his actual life, and feels himself not deserving of such punishment,
and therefore thinks he suffers for no guilt of his own, this alone
is sufficient to entitle the human soul to the fullest consolation,
rest, and bliss in his <i>post-mortem</i> existence. Death comes to our
spiritual selves ever as a deliverer and friend. For the materialist,
who, notwithstanding his materialism, was not a bad man, the interval
between the two lives will be like the unbroken and placid sleep of
a child, either entirely dreamless, or filled with pictures of which
he will have no definite perception; while for the average mortal it
will be a dream as vivid as life, and full of realistic bliss and visions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then the personal man must always go on suffering
<i>blindly</i> the Karmic penalties which the Ego has incurred?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not quite so. At the solemn
moment of death every man, even when death is sudden, sees the whole
of his past life marshalled before him, in its minutest details. For
one short instant the <i>personal</i> becomes one with the <i>individual</i>
and all-knowing <i>Ego</i>. But this instant is enough to show to him the
whole claim of causes which have been at work during his life. He
sees and now understands himself as he is, unadorned by flattery or
self-deception. He reads his life, remaining as a spectator looking
down into the arena he is quitting; he feels and knows the justice of
all the suffering that has overtaken him.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Does this happen to everyone?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Without any exception. Very good
and holy men see, we are taught, not only the life they are leaving,
but even several preceding lives in which were produced the causes that
made them what they were in the life just closing. They recognise the
law of Karma in all its majesty and justice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is there anything corresponding to
this before re-birth?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> There is. As the man at the moment
of death has a retrospective insight into the life he has led, so, at
the moment he is reborn on to earth, the <i>Ego</i>, awaking from the state
of Devachan, has a prospective vision of the life which awaits him, and
realizes all the causes that have led to it. He realizes them and sees
futurity, because it is between Devachan and re-birth that the <i>Ego</i>
regains his full <i>manasic</i> consciousness, and re-becomes for a short
time the god he was, before, in compliance with Karmic law, he first
descended into matter and incarnated in the first man of flesh. The
“golden thread” sees all its “pearls” and misses not one of them.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_9_5"></a>WHAT IS REALLY MEANT BY ANNIHILATION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have heard some Theosophists speak
of a golden thread on which their lives were strung. What do they mean
by this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In the Hindu Sacred books it
is said that that which undergoes periodical incarnation is the
<i>Sutratma</i>, which means literally the “Thread Soul.” It is a synonym of
the reincarnating Ego—Manas conjoined with <i>Buddhi</i>—which absorbs
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the Manasic recollections of all our preceding lives. It is so called,
because, like the pearls on a thread, so is the long series of human
lives strung together on that one thread. In some Upanishad these
recurrent rebirths are likened to the life of a mortal which oscillates
periodically between sleep and waking.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This, I must say, does not seem very
clear, and I will tell you why. For the man who awakes, another day
commences, but that man is the same in soul and body as he was the day
before; whereas at every incarnation a full change takes place not only
of the external envelope, sex, and personality, but even of the mental
and psychic capacities. The simile does not seem to me quite correct.
The man who arises from sleep remembers quite clearly what he has done
yesterday, the day before, and even months and years ago. But none of
us has the slightest recollection of a preceding life or of any fact or
event concerning it.... I may forget in the morning what I have dreamt
during the night, still I know that I have slept and have the certainty
that I lived during sleep; but what recollection can I have of my past
incarnation until the moment of death? How do you reconcile this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Some people do recollect their past
incarnations during life; but these are Buddhas and Initiates. This
is what the Yogis call Samma-Sambuddha, or the knowledge of the whole
series of one’s past incarnations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But we ordinary mortals who have not
reached Samma-Sambuddha, how are we to understand this simile?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> By studying it and trying to
understand more correctly the characteristics and the three kinds of
sleep. Sleep is a general and immutable law for man as for beast, but
there are different kinds of sleep and still more different dreams and visions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this takes us to another
subject. Let us return to the materialist who, while not denying
dreams, which he could hardly do, yet denies immortality in general and
the survival of his own individuality.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And the materialist, without
knowing it, is right. One who has no inner perception of, and faith
in, the immortality of his soul, in that man the soul can never become
Buddhi-taijasi, but will remain simply Manas, and for Manas alone there
is no immortality possible. In order to live in the world to come a
conscious life, one has to believe first of all in that life during the
terrestrial existence. On these two aphorisms of the Secret Science
all the philosophy about the <i>post-mortem</i> consciousness and the
immortality of the soul is built. The Ego receives always according to
its deserts. After the dissolution of the body, there commences for it
a period of full awakened consciousness, or a state of chaotic dreams,
or an utterly dreamless sleep undistinguishable from annihilation, and
these are the three kinds of sleep. If our physiologists find the cause
of dreams and visions in an unconscious preparation for them during the
waking hours, why cannot the same be admitted for the <i>post-mortem</i>
dreams? I repeat it: <i>death is sleep</i>. After death, before the
spiritual eyes of the soul, begins a performance according to a
programme learnt and very often unconsciously composed by ourselves:
the practical carrying out of <i>correct</i> beliefs or of illusions which
have been created by ourselves. The Methodist will be Methodist, the
Mussulman a Mussulman, at least for some time—in a perfect fool’s
paradise of each man’s creation and making. These are the <i>post-mortem</i>
fruits of the tree of life. Naturally, our belief or unbelief in the
fact of conscious immortality is unable to influence the unconditioned
reality of the fact itself, once that it exists; but the belief or
unbelief in that immortality as the property of independent or separate
entities, cannot fail to give colour to that fact in its application to
each of these entities. Now do you begin to understand it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I think I do. The materialist,
disbelieving in everything that cannot be proven to him by his five
senses, or by scientific reasoning, based exclusively on the data
furnished by these senses in spite of their inadequacy, and rejecting
every spiritual manifestation, accepts life as the only conscious
existence. Therefore according to their beliefs so will it be unto
them. They will lose their personal Ego, and will plunge into a
dreamless sleep until a new awakening. Is it so?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Almost so. Remember the practically
universal teaching of the two kinds of conscious existence: the
terrestrial and the spiritual. The latter must be considered real from
the very fact that it is inhabited by the eternal, changeless and
immortal Monad; whereas the incarnating Ego dresses itself up in new
garments entirely different from those of its previous incarnations,
and in which all except its spiritual prototype is doomed to a change
so radical as to leave no trace behind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How so? Can my conscious terrestrial
“I” perish not only for a time, like the consciousness of the
materialist, but so entirely as to leave no trace behind?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> According to the teaching, it must
so perish and in its fullness, all except the principle which, having
united itself with the Monad, has thereby become a purely spiritual
and indestructible essence, one with it in the Eternity. But in the
case of an out-and-out materialist, in whose personal “I” no Buddhi has
ever reflected itself, how can the latter carry away into the Eternity
one particle of that terrestrial personality? Your spiritual “I” is
immortal; but from your present self it can carry away into Eternity
that only which has become worthy of immortality, namely, the aroma
alone of the flower that has been mown by death.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Well, and the flower, the terrestrial “I”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The flower, as all past and future
flowers which have blossomed and will have to blossom on the mother
bough, the <i>Sutratma</i>, all children of one root or Buddhi—will return
to dust. Your present “I,” as you yourself know, is not the body now
sitting before me, nor yet is it what I would call Manas-Sutratma, but
Sutratma-Buddhi.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this does not explain to me, at
all, why you call life after death immortal, infinite and real, and
the terrestrial life a simple phantom or illusion; since even that
<i>post-mortem</i> life has limits, however much wider they may be
than those of terrestrial life.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No doubt. The spiritual Ego of
man moves in eternity like a pendulum between the hours of birth and
death. But if these hours, marking the periods of life terrestrial
and life spiritual, are limited in their duration, and if the very
number of such stages in Eternity between sleep and awakening,
illusion and reality, has its beginning and its end, on the other
hand, the spiritual pilgrim is eternal. Therefore are the hours of his
<i>post-mortem</i> life, when, disembodied, he stands face to face with
truth and not the mirages of his transitory earthly existences, during
the period of that pilgrimage which we call “the cycle of rebirths”—the
only reality in our conception. Such intervals, their limitation
notwithstanding, do not prevent the Ego, while ever perfecting itself,
from following undeviatingly, though gradually and slowly, the path
to its last transformation, when that Ego, having reached its goal,
becomes a divine being. These intervals and stages help towards
this final result instead of hindering it; and without such limited
intervals the divine Ego could never reach its ultimate goal. I have
given you once already a familiar illustration by comparing the <i>Ego</i>,
or the <i>individuality</i>, to an actor, and its numerous and various
incarnations to the parts it plays. Will you call these parts or their
costumes the individuality of the actor himself? Like that actor, the
Ego is forced to play during the cycle of necessity, up to the very
threshold of <i>Paranirvana</i>, many parts such as may be unpleasant to it.
But as the bee collects its honey from every flower, leaving the rest
as food for the earthly worms, so does our spiritual individuality,
whether we call it Sutratma or Ego. Collecting from every terrestrial
personality, into which Karma forces it to incarnate, the nectar alone
of the spiritual qualities and self-consciousness, it unites all these
into one whole and emerges from its chrysalis as the glorified Dhyan
Chohan. So much the worse for those terrestrial personalities from
which it could collect nothing. Such personalities cannot assuredly
outlive consciously their terrestrial existence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Thus, then, it seems that, for the
terrestrial personality, immortality is still conditional. Is, then,
immortality itself <i>not</i> unconditional?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all. But immortality
cannot touch the <i>non-existent</i>: for all that which exists
as <span class="smcap">Sat</span>, or emanates from <span class="smcap">Sat</span>, immortality and Eternity are absolute. Matter
is the opposite pole of spirit, and yet the two are one. The essence of
all this, <i>i.e.</i>, Spirit, Force and Matter, or the three in one, is as
endless as it is beginningless; but the form acquired by this triple
unity during its incarnations, its externality, is certainly only the
illusion of our personal conceptions. Therefore do we call Nirvana and
the Universal life alone a reality, while relegating the terrestrial
life, its terrestrial personality included, and even its Devachanic
existence, to the phantom realm of illusion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why in such a case call sleep
the reality, and waking the illusion?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is simply a comparison made to
facilitate the grasping of the subject, and from the standpoint of
terrestrial conceptions it is a very correct one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And still I cannot understand, if
the life to come is based on justice and the merited retribution for
all our terrestrial suffering, how in the case of materialists, many of
whom are really honest and charitable men, there should remain of their
personality nothing but the refuse of a faded flower.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No one ever said such a thing. No
materialist, however unbelieving, can die for ever in the fulness of
his spiritual individuality. What was said is that consciousness can
disappear either fully or partially in the case of a materialist, so
that no conscious remains of his personality survive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely this is annihilation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly not. One can sleep a dead
sleep and miss several stations during a long railway journey, without
the slightest recollection or consciousness, and awake at another
station and continue the journey past innumerable other halting-places
till the end of the journey or the goal is reached. Three kinds of
sleep were mentioned to you: the dreamless, the chaotic, and the one
which is so real, that to the sleeping man his dreams become full
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
realities. If you believe in the latter why can’t you believe in
the former; according to the after life a man has believed in and
expected, such is the life he will have. He who expected no life to
come will have an absolute blank, amounting to annihilation, in the
interval between the two rebirths. This is just the carrying out of
the programme we spoke of, a programme created by the materialists
themselves. But there are various kinds of materialists, as you say.
A selfish, wicked Egoist, one who never shed a tear for anyone but
himself, thus adding entire indifference to the whole world to his
unbelief, must, at the threshold of death, drop his personality for
ever. This personality having no tendrils of sympathy for the world
around and hence nothing to hook on to Sutratma, it follows that with
the last breath every connection between the two is broken. There being
no Devachan for such a materialist, the Sutratma will reincarnate
almost immediately. But those materialists who erred in nothing but
their disbelief will oversleep but one station. And the time will come
when that ex-materialist will perceive himself in the Eternity and
perhaps repent that he lost even one day, one station, from the life eternal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Still, would it not be more correct
to say that death is birth into a new life, or a return once more into
eternity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You may if you like. Only remember
that births differ, and that there are births of “still-born” beings,
which are <i>failures</i> of nature. Moreover, with your Western fixed
ideas about material life, the words “living” and “being” are quite
inapplicable to the pure subjective state of <i>post-mortem</i> existence.
It is just because, save in a few philosophers who are not read by the
many, and who themselves are too confused to present a distinct picture
of it, it is just because your Western ideas of life and death have
finally become so narrow, that on the one hand they have led to crass
materialism, and on the other, to the still more material conception
of the other life, which the spiritualists have formulated in their
Summer-land. There the souls of men eat, drink, marry, and live in a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
paradise quite as sensual as that of Mohammed, but even less
philosophical. Nor are the average conceptions of the uneducated
Christians any better, being if possible still more material. What
between truncated angels, brass trumpets, golden harps, and material
hell-fires, the Christian heaven seems like a fairy scene at a
Christmas pantomime.</p>
<p class="indent">It is because of these narrow conceptions that you
find such difficulty in understanding. It is just because the life of
the disembodied soul, while possessing all the vividness of reality,
as in certain dreams, is devoid of every grossly objective form of
terrestrial life, that the Eastern philosophers have compared it with
visions during sleep.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_9_6"></a>DEFINITE WORDS FOR DEFINITE THINGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Don’t you think it is because there
are no definite and fixed terms to indicate each “Principle” in man,
that such a confusion of ideas arises in our minds with respect to the
respective functions of these “Principles”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I have thought of it myself. The
whole trouble has arisen from this: we have started our expositions
of, and discussion about, the “Principles” using their Sanskrit names
instead of coining immediately, for the use of Theosophists, their
equivalents in English. We must try and remedy this now.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You will do well, as it may avoid
further confusion; no two theosophical writers, it seems to me, have
hitherto agreed to call the same “Principle” by the same name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The confusion is more apparent than
real, however. I have heard some of our Theosophists express surprise
at, and criticize several essays speaking of these “principles”; but,
when examined, there was no worse mistake in them than that of using
the word “Soul” to cover the three principles without specifying
the distinctions. The first, as positively the clearest of our
Theosophical writers, Mr. A. P. Sinnett, has some comprehensive and
admirably-written passages on the “Higher Self.”<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45_45">[45]</a>
His real idea has also been misconceived by
some, owing to his using the word “Soul” in a general sense. Yet here
are a few passages which will show to you how clear and comprehensive
is all that he writes on the subject:—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">
... “The human soul, once launched on the streams of evolution as a human
individuality,<a id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46_46">[46]</a>
passes through alternate periods of physical and relatively spiritual
existence. It passes from the one plane, or stratum, or condition of
nature to the other under the guidance of its Karmic affinities; living
in incarnations the life which its Karma has pre-ordained; modifying
its progress within the limitations of circumstances, and,—developing
fresh Karma by its use or abuse of opportunities,—it returns to
spiritual existence (Devachan) after each physical life,—through the
intervening region of Kamaloca—for rest and refreshment and for the
gradual absorption into its essence, as so much cosmic progress, of
the life’s experience gained ‘on earth’ or during physical existence.
This view of the matter will, moreover, have suggested many collateral
inferences to anyone thinking over the subject; for instance, that the
transfer of consciousness from the Kamaloca to the Devachanic stage of
this progression would necessarily be gradual<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47_47">[47]</a>;
that in truth, no hard-and-fast line separates the varieties of
spiritual conditions; that even the spiritual and physical planes, as
psychic faculties in living people show, are not so hopelessly walled
off from one another as materialistic theories would suggest; that
all states of nature are all around us simultaneously, and appeal to
different perceptive faculties; and so on.... It is clear that during
physical existence people who possess psychic faculties remain in
connection with the planes of superphysical consciousness; and although
most people may not be endowed with such faculties, we all, as the
phenomena of sleep, even, and especially ... those of somnambulism
or mesmerism, show, are capable of entering into conditions of
consciousness that the five physical senses have nothing to do with.
We—the souls within us—are not as it were altogether adrift in the
ocean of matter. We clearly retain some surviving interest or rights
in the shore from which, for a time, we have floated off. The process
of incarnation, therefore, is not fully described when we speak of
an <i>alternate</i> existence on the physical and spiritual planes, and
thus picture the soul as a complete entity slipping entirely from the
one state of existence to the other. The more correct definitions
of the process would probably represent incarnation as taking place
on this physical plane of nature by reason of an efflux emanating
from the soul. The Spiritual realm would all the while be the proper
habitat of the Soul, which would never entirely quit it; <i>and that
non-materializable portion of the Soul which abides permanently on
the spiritual plane may fitly</i>, perhaps, be spoken of as the <span class="smcap">Higher Self</span>.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">This “Higher Self” is <span class="smcap">Atma</span>, and of course it is “non-materializable,”
as Mr. Sinnett says. Even more, it can never be “objective” under
any circumstances, even to the highest spiritual perception.
For <i>Atman</i> or the “Higher Self” is really Brahma, the <span class="smcap">Absolute</span>, and indistinguishable from it. In hours
of <i>Samadhi</i>, the higher spiritual consciousness of the Initiate is
entirely absorbed in the <span class="smcap">ONE</span> essence,
which is Atman, and therefore, being one with the whole, there can
be nothing objective for it. Now some of our Theosophists have got
into the habit of using the words “Self” and “Ego” as synonymous, of
associating the term “Self” with only man’s higher individual or even
personal “Self” or <i>Ego</i>, whereas this term ought never to be applied
except <i>to the One universal Self</i>. Hence the confusion. Speaking
of Manas, the “causal body,” we may call it—when connecting it with
the Buddhic radiance—the “<span class="smcap">Higher Ego</span>,”
never the “Higher Self.” For even Buddhi, the “Spiritual Soul,” is
not the <span class="smcap">Self</span>, but the vehicle only of
<span class="smcap">Self</span>. All the other “<i>Selves</i>”—such as the
“Individual” self and “personal” self—ought never to be spoken or
written of without their qualifying and characteristic adjectives.</p>
<p class="indent">Thus in this most excellent essay on the “Higher
Self,” this term is applied to the <i>sixth principle</i> or <i>Buddhi</i> (of
course in conjunction with Manas, as without such union there would be
no <i>thinking</i> principle or element in the spiritual soul); and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
has in consequence given rise to just such misunderstandings. The
statement that “a child does not acquire its <i>sixth</i> principle—or
become a morally responsible being capable of generating Karma—until
seven years old,” proves what is meant therein by the <span class="smcap">Higher Self</span>. Therefore, the able author is
quite justified in explaining that after the “Higher Self” has
passed into the human being and saturated the personality—in some
of the finer organizations only—with its consciousness “people with
psychic faculties may indeed perceive this Higher Self through their
finer senses from time to time.” But so are those, who limit the
term “Higher Self” to the Universal Divine Principle, “justified” in
misunderstanding him. For, when we read, without being prepared for
this shifting of metaphysical terms,<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48_48">[48]</a>
that while “fully manifesting on the physical plane ... the Higher Self
still remains a conscious spiritual Ego on the corresponding plane
of Nature”—we are apt to see in the “Higher Self” of this sentence,
“Atma,” and in the spiritual Ego, “Manas,” or rather Buddhi-Manas, and
forthwith to criticise the whole thing as incorrect.</p>
<p class="indent">To avoid henceforth such misrepresentations, I
propose to translate literally from the Occult Eastern terms their
equivalents in English, and offer these for future use.

<h2>X. <br>ON THE NATURE OF OUR THINKING PRINCIPLE.</h2></div>
<h3>THE MYSTERY OF THE EGO.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I perceive in the quotation you
brought forward a little while ago from the <i>Buddhist Catechism</i> a
discrepancy that I would like to hear explained. It is there stated
that the Skandhas—memory included—change with every new incarnation.
And yet, it is asserted that the reflection of the past lives, which,
we are told, are entirely made up of Skandhas, “must survive.” At
the present moment I am not quite clear in my mind as to what it is
precisely that survives, and I would like to have it explained. What
is it? Is it only that “reflection,” or those Skandhas, or always that
same Ego, the Manas?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I have just explained that the
reincarnating Principle, or that which we call the <i>divine</i> man, is
indestructible throughout the life cycle: indestructible as a thinking
<i>Entity</i>, and even as an ethereal form. The “reflection” is only the
spiritualised <i>remembrance</i>, during the Devachanic period, of the
<i>ex-personality</i>, Mr. A. or Mrs. B.—with which the <i>Ego</i> identifies
itself during that period. Since the latter is but the continuation
of the earth-life, so to say, the very acme and pitch, in an unbroken
series, of the few happy moments in that now past existence, the <i>Ego</i>
has to identify itself with the <i>personal</i> consciousness of that life,
if anything shall remain of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This means that the <i>Ego</i>,
notwithstanding its divine nature, passes every such period between
two incarnations in a state of mental obscuration, or temporary insanity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You may regard it as you like.
Believing that, outside the <span class="smcap">One</span> Reality,
nothing is better than a passing illusion—the whole Universe
included—we do not view it as insanity, but as a very natural sequence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
or development of the terrestrial life. What is life? A bundle of
the most varied experiences, of daily changing ideas, emotions, and
opinions. In our youth we are often enthusiastically devoted to an
ideal, to some hero or heroine whom we try to follow and revive; a
few years later, when the freshness of our youthful feelings has
faded out and sobered down, we are the first to laugh at our fancies.
And yet there was a day when we had so thoroughly identified our own
personality with that of the ideal in our mind—especially if it was
that of a living being—that the former was entirely merged and lost in
the latter. Can it be said of a man of fifty that he is the same being
that he was at twenty? The <i>inner</i> man is the same; the outward living
personality is completely transformed and changed. Would you also call
these changes in the human mental states insanity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How would <i>you</i> name them, and
especially how would you explain the permanence of one and the
evanescence of the other?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We have our own doctrine ready,
and to us it offers no difficulty. The clue lies in the double
consciousness of our mind, and also, in the dual nature of the mental
“principle.” There is a spiritual consciousness, the Manasic mind
illumined by the light of Buddhi, that which subjectively perceives
abstractions; and the sentient consciousness (the lower <i>Manasic</i>
light), inseparable from our physical brain and senses. This latter
consciousness is held in subjection by the brain and physical senses,
and, being in its turn equally dependent on them, must of course fade
out and finally die with the disappearance of the brain and physical
senses. It is only the former kind of consciousness, whose root lies
in eternity, which survives and lives for ever, and may, therefore, be
regarded as immortal. Everything else belongs to passing illusions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you really understand by
illusion in this case?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is very well described in the
just-mentioned essay on “The Higher Self.” Says its author:
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“The theory we are considering (the interchange of
ideas between the <i>Higher Ego</i> and the lower self) harmonizes very well
with the treatment of this world in which we live as a phenomenal world
of illusion, the spiritual plans of nature being on the other hand the
noumenal world or plane of reality. That region of nature in which, so
to speak, the permanent soul is rooted is more real than that in which
its transitory blossoms appear for a brief space to wither and fall
to pieces, while the plant recovers energy for sending forth a fresh
flower. Supposing flowers only were perceptible to ordinary senses,
and their roots existed in a state of Nature intangible and invisible
to us, philosophers in such a world who divined that there were such
things as roots in another plane of existence would be apt to say of
the flowers, These are not the real plants; they are of no relative
importance, merely illusive phenomena of the moment.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is what I mean. The world in which blossom
the transitory and evanescent flowers of personal lives is not the
real permanent world; but that one in which we find the root of
consciousness, that root which is beyond illusion and dwells in the eternity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean by the root
dwelling in eternity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I mean by this root the thinking
entity, the Ego which incarnates, whether we regard it as an “Angel,”
“Spirit,” or a Force. Of that which falls under our sensuous
perceptions only what grows directly from, or is attached to this
invisible root above, can partake of its immortal life. Hence every
noble thought, idea and aspiration of the personality it informs,
proceeding from and fed by this root, must become permanent. As to
the physical consciousness, as it is a quality of the sentient but
lower “principle,” (Kama-rupa or animal instinct, illuminated by the
lower <i>manasic</i> reflection), or the human Soul—it must disappear.
That which displays activity, while the body is asleep or paralysed,
is the higher consciousness, our memory registering but feebly and
inaccurately—because automatically—such experiences, and often failing
to be even slightly impressed by them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how is it that <span class="smcap">Manas</span>,
although you call it <i>Nous</i>, a “God,” is so weak during its
incarnations, as to be actually conquered and fettered by its body?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I might retort with the same
question and ask: “How is it that he, whom you regard as ‘the God of
Gods’ and the One living God, <i>is so weak</i> as to allow evil (or the
Devil) to have the best of <i>him</i> as much as of all his creatures,
whether while he remains in Heaven, or during the time he was
incarnated on this earth?” You are sure to reply again: “This is a
Mystery; and we are forbidden to pry into the mysteries of God.”
Not being forbidden to do so by our religious philosophy, I answer
your question that, unless a God descends as an <i>Avatar</i>, no divine
principle can be otherwise than cramped and paralysed by turbulent,
animal matter. Heterogeneity will always have the upper hand over
homogeneity, on this plane of illusions, and the nearer an essence
is to its root-principle, Primordial Homogeneity, the more difficult
it is for the latter to assert itself on earth. Spiritual and divine
powers lie dormant in every human Being; and the wider the sweep of his
spiritual vision the mightier will be the God within him. But as few
men can feel that God, and since, as an average rule, deity is always
bound and limited in our thought by earlier conceptions, those ideas
that are inculcated in us from childhood, therefore, it is so difficult
for you to understand our philosophy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And is it this Ego of ours which is
our God?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all; “<i>A</i> God” is not the
universal deity, but only a spark from the one ocean of Divine Fire.
Our God <i>within</i> us, or “our Father in Secret” is what we call the
“<span class="smcap">Higher Self</span>,” <i>Atma</i>. Our incarnating Ego
was a God in its origin, as were all the primeval emanations of the
One Unknown Principle. But since its “fall into Matter,” having to
incarnate throughout the cycle, in succession, from first to last,
it is no longer a free and happy god, but a poor pilgrim on his way
to regain that which he has lost. I can answer your more fully by
repeating what is said of the <span class="smcap">Inner Man</span> in
<span class="smcap">Isis Unveiled</span> (Vol. II. 593):—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“From the remotest antiquity <i>mankind</i> as a
whole <i>have always been convinced of the existence of a personal
spiritual entity within the personal physical man</i>. This inner
entity was more or less divine, according to its proximity to the
<i>crown</i>. The closer the union the more serene man’s destiny, the less
dangerous the external conditions. This belief is neither bigotry
nor superstition, only an ever-present, instinctive feeling of the
proximity of another spiritual and invisible world, which, though it
be subjective to the senses of the outward man, is perfectly objective
to the inner ego. Furthermore, they believed that <i>there are external
and internal conditions which affect the determination of our will upon
our actions</i>. They rejected fatalism, for fatalism implies a blind
course of some still blinder power. But they believed in <i>destiny</i>
or <i>Karma</i>, which from birth to death every man is weaving thread by
thread around himself, as a spider does his cobweb; and this destiny
is guided by that presence termed by some the guardian angel, or our
more intimate astral inner man, who is but too often the evil genius
of the man of flesh or the <i>personality</i>. Both these lead on <span class="smcap">Man</span>, but one of them must prevail; and from the
very beginning of the invisible affray the stern and implacable <i>law
of compensation and retribution</i> steps in and takes its course,
following faithfully the fluctuations of the conflict. When the last
strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the network of his
own doing, then he finds himself completely under the empire of this
<i>self-made</i> destiny. It then either fixes him like the inert shell
against the immovable rock, or like a feather carries him away in a
whirlwind raised by his own actions.”</p>
<p class="indent">Such is the destiny of the <span class="smcap">Man</span>—the true Ego, not the Automaton, the <i>shell</i>
that goes by that name. It is for him to become the conqueror over matter.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_10_2"></a>THE COMPLEX NATURE OF MANAS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But you wanted to tell me something
of the essential nature of Manas, and of the relation in which the
Skandhas of physical man stand to it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is this nature, mysterious,
Protean, beyond any grasp, and almost shadowy in its correlations with
the other principles, that is most difficult to realise, and still more
so to explain. Manas is a “principle,” and yet it is an “Entity” and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
individuality or Ego. He is a “God,” and yet he is doomed to an endless
cycle of incarnations, for each of which he is made responsible, and
for each of which he has to suffer. All this seems as contradictory as
it is puzzling; nevertheless, there are hundreds of people, even in
Europe, who realise all this perfectly, for they comprehend the Ego not
only in its integrity but in its many aspects. Finally, if I would make
myself comprehensible, I must begin by the beginning and give you the
genealogy of this Ego in a few lines.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Say on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Try to imagine a “Spirit,” a
celestial Being, whether we call it by one name or another, divine in
its essential nature, yet not pure enough to be <i>one with the</i> <span class="smcap">All</span>, and having, in order to achieve this, to
so purify its nature as to finally gain that goal. It can do so only
by passing <i>individually</i> and <i>personally</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, spiritually and
physically, through every experience and feeling that exists in the
manifold or differentiated Universe. It has, therefore, after having
gained such experience in the lower kingdoms, and having ascended
higher and still higher with every rung on the ladder of being, to
pass through every experience on the human planes. In its very essence
it is THOUGHT, and is, therefore, called in its plurality <i>Manasa
putra</i>, “the Sons of the (Universal) mind.” This <i>individualised</i>
“Thought” is what we Theosophists call the <i>real</i> human <span class="smcap">Ego</span>, the thinking Entity imprisoned in a case of
flesh and bones. This is surely a Spiritual Entity, not <i>Matter</i>, and
such Entities are the incarnating <span class="smcap">Egos</span> that
inform the bundle of animal matter called mankind, and whose names are
<i>Manasa</i> or “Minds.” But once imprisoned, or incarnate, their essence
becomes dual: that is to say, the <i>rays</i> of the eternal divine Mind,
considered as individual entities, assume a two-fold attribute which is
(<i>a</i>) their <i>essential</i> inherent characteristic, heaven-aspiring mind
(higher <i>Manas</i>) and (<i>b</i>) the human quality of thinking, or animal
cogitation, rationalised owing to the superiority of the human brain,
the Kama-tending or lower Manas. One gravitates toward Buddhi, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
other, tending downward, to the seat of passions and animal desires.
The latter have no room in Devachan, nor can they associate with the
divine triad which ascends as ONE into mental bliss. Yet it is the Ego,
the Manasic Entity, which is held responsible for all the sins of the
lower attributes, just as a parent is answerable for the transgressions
of his child, so long as the latter remains irresponsible.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is this “child” the
“personality”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is. When, therefore, it
is stated that the “personality” dies with the body it does not
state all. The body, which was only the objective symbol of Mr. A.
or Mrs. B., fades away with all its material Skandhas, which are
the visible expressions thereof. But all that which constituted
during life the <i>spiritual</i> bundle of experiences, the noblest
aspirations, undying affections, and <i>unselfish</i> nature of Mr. A. or
Mrs. B. clings for the time of the Devachanic period to the <span class="smcap">Ego</span>, which is identified with the spiritual
portion of that terrestrial Entity, now passed away out of sight. The
<span class="smcap">Actor</span> is so imbued with the <i>rôle</i> just
played by him that he dreams of it during the whole Devachanic night,
which <i>vision</i> continues till the hour strikes for him to return to the
stage of life to enact another part.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how is it that this doctrine,
which you say is as old as thinking men, has found no room, say, in
Christian theology?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You are mistaken, it has; only
theology has disfigured it out of all recognition, as it has many
other doctrines. Theology calls the <span class="smcap">Ego</span>
the Angel that God gives us at the moment of our birth, <i>to take care
of our Soul</i>. Instead of holding that “Angel” responsible for the
transgressions of the poor helpless “Soul,” it is the latter which,
according to theological logic, is punished for all the sins of both
flesh and mind! It is the Soul, the immaterial <i>breath</i> of God and his
<i>alleged creation</i>, which, by some most amazing intellectual jugglery,
is doomed to burn in a material hell without ever being
consumed,<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49_49">[49]</a>
while the “Angel” escapes scot free after folding his white pinions
and wetting them with a few tears. Aye, these are our “ministering
Spirits,” the “messengers of mercy” who are sent, Bishop Mant tells us—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“.... to fulfil</span>
<span class="i0">Good for Salvation’s heirs, for us they still</span>
<span class="i0">Grieve when we sin, rejoice when we repent;”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="no-indent"> Yet it becomes evident that if all the Bishops
the world over were asked to define once for all what they mean by
<i>Soul</i> and its functions, they would be as unable to do so as to show
us any shadow of logic in the orthodox belief!</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_10_3"></a>THE DOCTRINE IS TAUGHT IN ST. JOHN’S GOSPEL.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> To this the adherents to this
belief might answer, that if even the orthodox dogma does promise the
impenitent sinner and materialist a bad time of it in a rather too
realistic Inferno, it gives them, on the other hand, a chance for
repentance to the last minute. Nor do they teach annihilation, or loss
of personality, which is all the same.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If the Church teaches nothing of
the kind, on the other hand, Jesus does; and that is something to
those, at least, who place Christ higher than Christianity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Does Christ teach anything of the
sort?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> He does; and every well-informed
Occultist and even Kabalist will tell you so. Christ, or the fourth
Gospel at any rate, teaches re-incarnation as also the annihilation
of the personality, if you but forget the dead letter and hold to the
esoteric Spirit. Remember verses 1 and 2 in chapter xv. of St. John.
What does the parable speak about if not of the <i>upper triad</i> in
man? <i>Atma</i> is the Husbandman—the Spiritual Ego or <i>Buddhi</i> (Christos)
the Vine, while the animal and vital Soul, the <i>personality</i>, is the
“branch.” “I am the <i>true</i> vine, and my Father is the Husbandman. Every
branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away.... As the branch
cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine; no more can
ye, except ye abide in me. I am the Vine—ye are the branches. If a man
abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch, and is <i>withered</i> and
cast into the fire and burned.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent">Now we explain it in this way. Disbelieving in the
hell-fires which theology discovers as underlying the threat to the
<i>branches</i>, we say that the “Husbandman” means Atma, the Symbol for the
infinite, impersonal Principle,<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50_50">[50]</a>
while the Vine stands for the Spiritual Soul, <i>Christos</i>, and each
“branch” represents a new incarnation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what proofs have you to support
such an arbitrary interpretation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Universal symbology is a warrant
for its correctness and that it is not arbitrary. Hermas says of “God”
that he “planted the Vineyard,” <i>i.e.</i>, he created mankind. In the
<i>Kabala</i>, it is shown that the Aged of the Aged, or the “Long Face,”
plants a vineyard, the latter typifying mankind; and a vine, meaning
Life. The Spirit of “<i>King</i> Messiah” is, therefore, shown as washing
his garments in <i>the wine</i> from above, from the creation of the
world.<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51_51">[51]</a>
And King <i>Messiah</i> is the <span class="smcap">Ego</span> purified
<i>by washing his garments</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, his personalities in re-birth),
in the <i>wine from</i> above, or <span class="smcap">Buddhi</span>.
Adam, or A-Dam, is “blood.” The Life of the flesh is in the blood
(nephesh—soul), <i>Leviticus</i> xvii. And Adam-Kadmon is the Only-Begotten.
Noah also plants a vineyard—the allegorical hot-bed of future humanity.
As a consequence of the adoption of the same allegory, we find it
reproduced in the Nazarene <i>Codex</i>. Seven vines are procreated—which
seven vines are our Seven Races with their seven Saviours or
<i>Buddhas</i>—which spring from Iukabar Zivo, and Ferho (or Parcha) Raba
waters them.<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52_52">[52]</a>
When the blessed will ascend among the creatures of Light, they shall
see Iavar-Xivo, <i>Lord of</i> <span class="smcap">Life</span>, and the
<span class="smcap">First Vine</span>.<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53_53">[53]</a>
These kabalistic metaphors are thus naturally repeated in the <i>Gospel
according to St. John</i> (xv., 1).
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p class="indent"> Let us not forget that in the human system—even
according to those philosophies which ignore our septenary division—the
<span class="smcap">Ego</span> or <i>thinking man</i> is called the <i>Logos</i>,
or the Son of Soul and Spirit. “Manas is the adopted Son of King ——
and Queen ——” (esoteric equivalents for Atma and Buddhi), says an
occult work. He is the “man-god” of Plato, who crucifies himself in
<i>Space</i> (or the duration of the life cycle) for the redemption of
<span class="smcap">Matter</span>. This he does by incarnating over
and over again, thus leading mankind onward to perfection, and making
thereby room for lower forms to develop into higher. Not for one life
does he cease progressing himself and helping all physical nature to
progress; even the occasional, very rare event of his losing one of his
personalities, in the case of the latter being entirely devoid of even
a spark of spirituality, helps toward his individual progress.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely, if the <i>Ego</i> is held
responsible for the transgressions of its personalities, it has to
answer also for the loss, or rather the complete annihilation, of one
of such.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all, unless it has
done nothing to avert this dire fate. But if, all its efforts
notwithstanding, its voice, <i>that of our conscience</i>, was unable to
penetrate through the wall of matter, then the obtuseness of the
latter proceeding from the imperfect nature of the material is classed
with other failures of nature. The Ego is sufficiently punished by
the loss of Devachan, and especially by having to incarnate almost
immediately.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This doctrine of the possibility of
losing one’s soul—or personality, do you call it?—militates against the
ideal theories of both Christians and Spiritualists, though Swedenborg
adopts it to a certain extent, in what he calls <i>Spiritual death</i>. They
will never accept it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This can in no way alter a fact in
nature, if it be a fact, or prevent such a thing occasionally taking
place. The universe and everything in it, moral, mental, physical,
psychic, or Spiritual, is built on a perfect law of equilibrium and
harmony. As said before (<i>vide Isis Unveiled</i>), the centripetal
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
force could not manifest itself without the centrifugal in the
harmonious revolutions of the spheres, and all forms and their
progress are the products of this dual force in nature. Now the
Spirit (or <i>Buddhi</i>) is the centrifugal and the soul (<i>Manas</i>) the
centripetal spiritual energy; and to produce one result they have
to be in perfect union and harmony. Break or damage the centripetal
motion of the earthly soul tending toward the centre which attracts
it; arrest its progress by clogging it with a heavier weight of matter
than it can bear, or than is fit for the Devachanic state, and the
harmony of the whole will be destroyed. Personal life, or perhaps
rather its ideal reflection, can only be continued if sustained
by the two-fold force, that is by the close union of <i>Buddhi</i> and
<i>Manas</i> in every re-birth or personal life. The least deviation from
harmony damages it; and when it is destroyed beyond redemption the two
forces separate at the moment of death. During a brief interval the
<i>personal</i> form (called indifferently <i>Kama rupa</i> and <i>Mayavi rupa</i>),
the spiritual efflorescence of which, attaching itself to the Ego,
follows it into Devachan and gives to the permanent <i>individuality</i>
its <i>personal</i> colouring (<i>pro tem.</i>, so to speak), is carried
off to remain in <i>Kama-loka</i> and to be gradually annihilated. For
it is after the death of the utterly depraved, the unspiritual and
the wicked beyond redemption, that arrives the critical and supreme
moment. If during life the ultimate and desperate effort of the <span class="smcap">Inner Self</span> (<i>Manas</i>), to unite something of the
personality with itself and the high glimmering ray of the divine
Buddhi is thwarted; if this ray is allowed to be more and more shut out
from the ever-thickening crust of physical brain, the Spiritual <span class="smcap">Ego</span> or Manas, once freed from the body, remains
severed entirely from the ethereal relic of the personality; and the
latter, or <i>Kama rupa</i>, following its earthly attractions, is drawn
into and remains in Hades, which we call the <i>Kama-loka</i>. These are
“the withered branches” mentioned by Jesus as being cut off from the
<i>Vine</i>. Annihilation, however, is never instantaneous, and may require
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
centuries sometimes for its accomplishment. But there the personality
remains along with the <i>remnants</i> of other more fortunate personal
Egos, and becomes with them a <i>shell</i> and an <i>Elementary</i>. As said
in <i>Isis</i>, it is these two classes of “Spirits,” the <i>shells</i> and
the <i>Elementaries</i>, which are the leading “Stars” on the great
spiritual stage of “materialisations.” And you may be sure of it,
it is not they who incarnate; and, therefore, so few of these “dear
departed ones” know anything of re-incarnation, misleading thereby the Spiritualists.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But does not the author of “<i>Isis
Unveiled</i>” stand accused of having preached against re-incarnation?
<span class="smcap">Theo.</span> By those who have misunderstood what
was said, yes. At the time that work was written, re-incarnation was
not believed in by any Spiritualists, either English or American,
and what is said there of <i>re-incarnation</i> was directed against the
French Spiritists, whose theory is as unphilosophical and absurd as
the Eastern teaching is logical and self-evident in its truth. The
Re-incarnationists of the Allan Kardec School believe in an arbitrary
and immediate re-incarnation. With them, the dead father can incarnate
in his own unborn daughter, and so on. They have neither Devachan,
Karma, nor any philosophy that would warrant or prove the necessity of
consecutive rebirths. But how can the author of “Isis” argue against
<i>Karmic</i> re-incarnation, at long intervals varying between 1,000 and
1,500 years, when it is the fundamental belief of both Buddhists and
Hindus?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then you reject the theories of both
the Spiritists and the Spiritualists, in their entirety?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not in their entirety, but only
with regard to their respective fundamental beliefs. Both rely on what
their “Spirits” tell them; and both disagree as much with each other as
we Theosophists disagree with both. Truth is one; and when we hear the
French spooks preaching re-incarnation, and the English spooks denying
and denouncing the doctrine, we say that either the French or the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
English “Spirits” do not know what they are talking about. We
believe with the Spiritualists and the Spiritists in the existence
of “Spirits,” or invisible Beings endowed with more or less
intelligence. But, while in our teachings their kinds and <i>genera</i>
are legion, our opponents admit of no other than human disembodied
“Spirits,” which, to our knowledge, are mostly Kamalokic <span class="smcap">Shells</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You seem very bitter against
Spirits. As you have given me your views and your reasons for
disbelieving in the materialization of, and direct communication
in <i>séances</i>, with the disembodied spirits—or the “spirits of the
dead”—would you mind enlightening me as to one more fact? Why are some
Theosophists never tired of saying how dangerous is intercourse with
spirits, and mediumship? Have they any particular reason for this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We must suppose so. I know I have.
Owing to my familiarity for over half a century with these invisible,
yet but too tangible and undeniable “influences,” from the conscious
Elementals, semi-conscious <i>shells</i>, down to the utterly senseless
and nondescript spooks of all kinds, I claim a certain right to my
views.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you give an instance or
instances to show why these practices should be regarded as dangerous?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This would require more time than I
can give you. Every cause must be judged by the effects it produces. Go
over the history of Spiritualism for the last fifty years, ever since
its reappearance in this century in America—and judge for yourself
whether it has done its votaries more good or harm. Pray understand
me. I do not speak against real Spiritualism, but against the modern
movement which goes under that name, and the so-called philosophy
invented to explain its phenomena.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Don’t you believe in their phenomena
at all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is because I believe in them
with too good reason, and (save some cases of deliberate fraud) know
them to be as true as that you and I live, that all my being revolts
against them. Once more I speak only of physical, not mental or even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
psychic phenomena. Like attracts like. There are several high-minded,
pure, good men and women, known to me personally, who have passed years
of their lives under the direct guidance and even protection of high
“Spirits,” whether disembodied or planetary. But <i>these</i> Intelligences
are not of the type of the John Kings and the Ernests who figure in
<i>séance</i> rooms. These Intelligences guide and control mortals only in
rare and exceptional cases to which they are attracted and magnetically
drawn by the Karmic past of the individual. It is not enough to sit
“for development” in order to attract them. That only opens the door
to a swarm of “spooks,” good, bad and indifferent, to which the medium
becomes a slave for life. It is against such promiscuous mediumship and
intercourse with goblins that I raise my voice, not against spiritual
mysticism. The latter is ennobling and holy; the former is of just
the same nature as the phenomena of two centuries ago, for which so
many witches and wizards have been made to suffer. Read Glanvil and
other authors on the subject of witchcraft, and you will find recorded
there the parallels of most, if not all, of the physical phenomena of
nineteenth century “Spiritualism.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you mean to suggest that it is
all witchcraft and nothing more?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What I mean is that, whether
conscious or unconscious, all this dealing with the dead is
<i>necromancy</i>, and a most dangerous practice. For ages before Moses
such raising of the dead was regarded by all the intelligent nations
as sinful and cruel, inasmuch as it disturbs the rest of the souls and
interferes with their evolutionary development into higher states.
The collective wisdom of all past centuries has ever been loud in
denouncing such practices. Finally, I say, what I have never ceased
repeating orally and in print for fifteen years: While some of the
so-called “spirits” do not know what they are talking about, repeating
merely—like poll-parrots—what they find in the mediums’ and other
people’s brains, others are most dangerous, and can only lead one to
evil. These are two self-evident facts. Go into spiritualistic
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
circles of the Allan Kardec school, and you find “spirits” asserting
re-incarnation and speaking like Roman Catholics born. Turn to the
“dear departed ones” in England and America, and you will hear them
denying re-incarnation through thick and thin, denouncing those who
teach it, and holding to Protestant views. Your best, your most
powerful mediums, have all suffered in health of body and mind. Think
of the sad end of Charles Foster, who died in an asylum, a raving
lunatic; of Slade, an epileptic; of Eglinton—the best medium now in
England—subject to the same. Look back over the life of D. D. Home, a
man whose mind was steeped in gall and bitterness, who never had a good
word to say of anyone whom he suspected of possessing psychic powers,
and who slandered every other medium to the bitter end. This Calvin of
Spiritualism suffered for years from a terrible spinal disease, brought
on by his intercourse with the “spirits,” and died a perfect wreck.
Think again of the sad fate of poor Washington Irving Bishop. I knew
him in New York, when he was fourteen, and he was undeniably a medium.
It is true that the poor man stole a march on his “spirits,” and
baptized them “unconscious muscular action,” to the great <i>gaudium</i> of
all the corporations of highly learned and scientific fools, and to the
replenishment of his own pocket. But <i>de mortuis nil nisi bonum</i>; his
end was a sad one. He had strenuously concealed his epileptic fits—the
first and strongest symptom of genuine mediumship—and who knows whether
he was dead or in a trance when the <i>post-mortem</i> examination was
performed? His relatives insist that he was alive, if we are to believe
Reuter’s telegrams. Finally, behold the veteran mediums, the founders
and prime movers of modern spiritualism—the Fox sisters. After more
than forty years of intercourse with the “Angels,” the latter have
led them to become incurable sots, who are now denouncing, in public
lectures, their own life-long work and philosophy as a fraud. What kind
of spirits must they be who prompted them, I ask you?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is your inference a correct one?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What would you infer if the best
pupils of a particular school of singing broke down from overstrained
sore throats? That the method followed was a bad one. So I think the
inference is equally fair with regard to Spiritualism when we see their
best mediums fall a prey to such a fate. We can only say:—Let those
who are interested in the question judge the tree of Spiritualism by
its fruits, and ponder over the lesson. We Theosophists have always
regarded the Spiritualists as brothers having the same mystic tendency
as ourselves, but they have always regarded us as enemies. We, being in
possession of an older philosophy, have tried to help and warn them;
but they have repaid us by reviling and traducing us and our motives
in every possible way. Nevertheless, the best English Spiritualists
say just as we do, wherever they treat of their belief seriously.
Hear “M.A. Oxon.” confessing this truth: “Spiritualists are too much
inclined to dwell exclusively on the intervention of external spirits
in this world of ours, <i>and to ignore the powers of the incarnate</i>
Spirit.”<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54_54">[54]</a>
Why vilify and abuse us, then, for saying precisely the same?
Henceforward, we will have nothing more to do with Spiritualism.
And now let us return to Re-incarnation.

<div class="chapter"><a id="SECTION_11_1"></a>
<h2>XI. <br>ON THE MYSTERIES OF RE-INCARNATION.</h2></div>
<h3>PERIODICAL REBIRTHS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You mean, then, that we have all
lived on earth before, in many past incarnations, and shall go on so
living?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I do. The life-cycle, or rather
the cycle of conscious life, begins with the separation of the mortal
animal-man into sexes, and will end with the close of the last
generation of men, in the seventh round and seventh race of mankind.
Considering we are only in the fourth round and fifth race, its
duration is more easily imagined than expressed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And we keep on incarnating in new
<i>personalities</i> all the time?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Most assuredly so; because this
life-cycle or period of incarnation may be best compared to human life.
As each such life is composed of days of activity separated by nights
of sleep or of inaction, so, in the incarnation-cycle, an active life
is followed by a Devachanic rest.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And it is this succession of births
that is generally defined as re-incarnation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just so. It is only through these
births that the perpetual progress of the countless millions of Egos
toward final perfection and final rest (as long as was the period of
activity) can be achieved.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what is it that regulates the
duration, or special qualities of these incarnations?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Karma, the universal law of
retributive justice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is it an intelligent law?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> For the Materialist, who calls
the law of periodicity which regulates the marshalling of the several
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
bodies, and all the other laws in nature, blind forces and mechanical
laws, no doubt Karma would be a law of chance and no more. For us, no
adjective or qualification could describe that which is impersonal and
no entity, but a universal operative law. If you question me about
the causative intelligence in it, I must answer you I do not know.
But if you ask me to define its effects and tell you what these are
in our belief, I may say that the experience of thousands of ages has
shown us that they are absolute and unerring <i>equity</i>, <i>wisdom</i>, and
<i>intelligence</i>. For Karma in its effects, is an unfailing redresser of
human injustice, and of all the failures of nature; a stern adjuster
of wrongs; a retributive law which rewards and punishes with equal
impartiality. It is, in the strictest sense, “no respecter of persons,”
though, on the other hand, it can neither be propitiated, nor turned
aside by prayer. This is a belief common to Hindus and Buddhists, who
both believe in Karma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> In this Christian dogmas contradict
both, and I doubt whether any Christian will accept the teaching.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No; and Inman gave the reason for
it many years ago. As he puts it, while “the Christians will accept
any nonsense, if promulgated by the Church as a matter of faith ...
the Buddhists hold that nothing which is contradicted by sound reason
can be a true doctrine of Buddha.” They do not believe in any pardon
for their sins, except after an adequate and just punishment for each
evil deed or thought in a future incarnation, and a proportionate
compensation to the parties injured.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Where is it so stated?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In most of their sacred works.
In the “<i>Wheel of the Law</i>” (p. 57) you may find the following
Theosophical tenet:—“Buddhists believe that every act, word or thought
has its consequence, which will appear sooner or later in the present
or in the future state. Evil acts will produce evil consequences, good
acts will produce good consequences: prosperity in this world, or birth
in heaven (Devachan)... in the future state.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Christians believe the same thing,
don’t they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Oh, no; they believe in the pardon
and the remission of all sins. They are promised that if they only
believe in the blood of Christ (an <i>innocent</i> victim!), in the blood
offered by Him for the expiation of the sins of the whole of mankind,
it will atone for every mortal sin. And we believe neither in vicarious
atonement, nor in the possibility of the remission of the smallest sin
by any god, not even by a “<i>personal</i> Absolute” or “Infinite,” if such
a thing could have any existence. What we believe in, is strict and
impartial justice. Our idea of the unknown Universal Deity, represented
by Karma, is that it is a Power which cannot fail, and can, therefore,
have neither wrath nor mercy, only absolute Equity, which leaves
every cause, great or small, to work out its inevitable effects. The
saying of Jesus: “With what measure you mete it shall be measured to
you again” (Matth. vii., 2), neither by expression nor implication
points to any hope of future mercy or salvation by proxy. This is why,
recognising as we do in our philosophy the justice of this statement,
we cannot recommend too strongly mercy, charity, and forgiveness of
mutual offences. <i>Resist not evil</i>, and <i>render good for evil</i>, are
Buddhist precepts, and were first preached in view of the implacability
of Karmic law. For man to take the law into his own hands is anyhow a
sacrilegious presumption. Human Law may use restrictive not punitive
measures; but a man who, believing in Karma, still revenges himself and
refuses to forgive every injury, thereby rendering good for evil, is
a criminal and only hurts himself. As Karma is sure to punish the man
who wronged him, by seeking to inflict an additional punishment on his
enemy, he, who instead of leaving that punishment to the great Law adds
to it his own mite, only begets thereby a cause for the future reward
of his own enemy and a future punishment for himself. The unfailing
Regulator affects in each incarnation the quality of its successor; and
the sum of the merit or demerit in preceding ones determines it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Are we then to infer a man’s past
from his present?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Only so far as to believe that his
present life is what it justly should be, to atone for the sins of
the past life. Of course—seers and great adepts excepted—we cannot as
average mortals know what those sins were. From our paucity of data,
it is impossible for us even to determine what an old man’s youth must
have been; neither can we, for like reasons, draw final conclusions
merely from what we see in the life of some man, as to what his past
life may have been.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_11_2"></a>WHAT IS KARMA?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what is Karma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As I have said, we consider it as
the <i>Ultimate Law</i> of the Universe, the source, origin and fount of all
other laws which exist throughout Nature. Karma is the unerring law
which adjusts effect to cause, on the physical, mental and spiritual
planes of being. As no cause remains without its due effect from
greatest to least, from a cosmic disturbance down to the movement
of your hand, and as like produces like, <i>Karma</i> is that unseen and
unknown law <i>which adjusts wisely, intelligently and equitably</i> each
effect to its cause, tracing the latter back to its producer. Though
itself <i>unknowable</i>, its action is perceivable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then it is the “Absolute,” the
“Unknowable” again, and is not of much value as an explanation of the
problems of life?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> On the contrary. For, though we
do not know what Karma is <i>per se</i>, and in its essence, we <i>do</i> know
<i>how</i> it works, and we can define and describe its mode of action with
accuracy. We only do <i>not</i> know its ultimate <i>Cause</i>, just as modern
philosophy universally admits that the <i>ultimate</i> Cause of anything is “unknowable.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what has Theosophy to say in
regard to the solution of the more practical needs of humanity? What is
the explanation which it offers in reference to the awful suffering and
dire necessity prevalent among the so-called “lower classes.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To be pointed, according to our
teaching all these great social evils, the distinction of classes
in Society, and of the sexes in the affairs of life, the unequal
distribution of capital and of labour—all are due to what we tersely
but truly denominate <span class="smcap">Karma</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But, surely, all these evils which
seem to fall upon the masses somewhat indiscriminately are not actual
merited and <span class="smcap">INDIVIDUAL</span> Karma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No, they cannot be so strictly
defined in their effects as to show that each individual environment,
and the particular conditions of life in which each person finds
himself, are nothing more than the retributive Karma which the
individual generated in a previous life. We must not lose sight of the
fact that every atom is subject to the general law governing the whole
body to which it belongs, and here we come upon the wider track of
the Karmic law. Do you not perceive that the aggregate of individual
Karma becomes that of the nation to which those individuals belong, and
further, that the sum total of National Karma is that of the World!
The evils that you speak of are not peculiar to the individual or even
to the Nation, they are more or less universal; and it is upon this
broad line of Human interdependence that the law of Karma finds its
legitimate and equable issue.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do I, then, understand that the law
of Karma is not necessarily an individual law?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That is just what I mean. It
is impossible that Karma could readjust the balance of power in
the world’s life and progress, unless it had a broad and general
line of action. It is held as a truth among Theosophists that the
interdependence of Humanity is the cause of what is called Distributive
Karma, and it is this law which affords the solution to the great
question of collective suffering and its relief. It is an occult law,
moreover, that no man can rise superior to his individual failings,
without lifting, be it ever so little, the whole body of which he is an
integral part. In the same way, no one can sin, nor suffer the effects
of sin, alone. In reality, there is no such thing as “Separateness”;
and the nearest approach to that selfish state, which the laws of life
permit, is in the intent or motive.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And are there no means by which the
distributive or national Karma might be concentred or collected, so to
speak, and brought to its natural and legitimate fulfilment without all
this protracted suffering?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As a general rule, and within
certain limits which define the age to which we belong, the law of
Karma cannot be hastened or retarded in its fulfilment. But of this I
am certain, the point of possibility in either of these directions has
never yet been touched. Listen to the following recital of one phase
of national suffering, and then ask yourself whether, admitting the
working power of individual, relative, and distributive Karma, these
evils are not capable of extensive modification and general relief.
What I am about to read to you is from the pen of a National Saviour,
one who, having overcome Self, and being free to choose, has elected to
serve Humanity, in bearing at least as much as a woman’s shoulders can
possibly bear of National Karma. This is what she says:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Yes, Nature always does speak, don’t you think?
only sometimes we make so much noise that we drown her voice. That is
why it is so restful to go out of the town and nestle awhile in the
Mother’s arms. I am thinking of the evening on Hampstead Heath when we
watched the sun go down; but oh! upon what suffering and misery that
sun had set! A lady brought me yesterday a big hamper of wild flowers.
I thought some of my East-end family had a better right to it than
I, and so I took it down to a very poor school in Whitechapel this
morning. You should have seen the pallid little faces brighten! Thence
I went to pay for some dinners at a little cookshop for some children.
It was in a back street, narrow, full of jostling people; stench
indescribable, from fish, meat, and other comestibles, all reeking in
a sun that, in Whitechapel, festers instead of purifying. The cookshop
was the quintessence of all the smells. Indescribable meat-pies at
1d., loathsome lumps of ‘food’ and swarms of flies, a very altar of
Beelzebub! All about, babies on the prowl for scraps, one, with the
face of an angel, gathering up cherrystones as a light and nutritious
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
form of diet. I came westward with every nerve shuddering and jarred,
wondering whether anything can be done with some parts of London save
swallowing them up in an earthquake and starting their inhabitants
afresh, after a plunge into some purifying Lethe, out of which
not a memory might emerge! And then I thought of Hampstead Heath,
and—pondered. If by any sacrifice one could win the power to save these
people, the cost would not be worth counting; but, you see, THEY must
be changed—and how can that be wrought? In the condition they now are,
they would not profit by any environment in which they might be placed;
and yet, in their present surroundings they must continue to putrefy.
It breaks my heart, this endless, hopeless misery, and the brutish
degradation that is at once its outgrowth and its root. It is like the
banyan tree; every branch roots itself and sends out new shoots. What a
difference between these feelings and the peaceful scene at Hampstead!
and yet we, who are the brothers and sisters of these poor creatures,
have only a right to use Hampstead Heaths to gain strength to save
Whitechapels.” (<i>Signed by a name too respected and too well known to
be given to scoffers.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> That is a sad but beautiful letter,
and I think it presents with painful conspicuity the terrible workings
of what you have called “Relative and Distributive Karma.” But alas!
there seems no immediate hope of any relief short of an earthquake, or
some such general ingulfment!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What right have we to think so
while one-half of humanity is in a position to effect an immediate
relief of the privations which are suffered by their fellows? When
every individual has contributed to the general good what he can of
money, of labour, and of ennobling thought, then, and only then, will
the balance of National Karma be struck, and until then we have no
right nor any reasons for saying that there is more life on the earth
than Nature can support. It is reserved for the heroic souls, the
Saviours of our Race and Nation, to find out the cause of this unequal
pressure of retributive Karma, and by a supreme effort to readjust
the balance of power, and save the people from a moral ingulfment a
thousand times more disastrous and more permanently evil than the like
physical catastrophe, in which you seem to see the only possible outlet
for this accumulated misery.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Well, then, tell me generally how
you describe this law of Karma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We describe Karma as that Law
of readjustment which ever tends to restore disturbed equilibrium
in the physical, and broken harmony in the moral world. We say that
Karma does not act in this or that particular way always; but that it
always <i>does</i> act so as to restore Harmony and preserve the balance of
equilibrium, in virtue of which the Universe exists.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Give me an illustration.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Later on I will give you a full
illustration. Think now of a pond. A stone falls into the water and
creates disturbing waves. These waves oscillate backwards and forwards
till at last, owning to the operation of what physicists call the
law of the dissipation of energy, they are brought to rest, and the
water returns to its condition of calm tranquillity. Similarly <i>all</i>
action, on every plane, produces disturbance in the balanced harmony
of the Universe, and the vibrations so produced will continue to roll
backwards and forwards, if its area is limited, till equilibrium is
restored. But since each such disturbance starts from some particular
point, it is clear that equilibrium and harmony can only be restored
by the reconverging <i>to that same point</i> of all the forces which were
set in motion from it. And here you have proof that the consequences of
a man’s deeds, thoughts, etc., must all react upon <i>himself</i> with the
same force with which they were set in motion.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But I see nothing of a moral
character about this law. It looks to me like the simple physical law
that action and reaction are equal and opposite.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I am not surprised to hear you
say that. Europeans have got so much into the ingrained habit of
considering right and wrong, good and evil, as matters of an arbitrary
code of law laid down either by men, or imposed upon them by a Personal
God. We Theosophists, however, say that “Good” and “Harmony,” and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
“Evil” and “Dis-harmony,” are synonymous. Further we maintain that all
pain and suffering are results of want of Harmony, and that the one
terrible and only cause of the disturbance of Harmony is selfishness in
some form or another. Hence Karma gives back to every man the <i>actual
consequences</i> of his own actions, without any regard to their moral
character; but since he receives his due for <i>all</i>, it is obvious that
he will be made to atone for all sufferings which he has caused, just
as he will reap in joy and gladness the fruits of all the happiness and
harmony he had helped to produce. I can do no better than quote for
your benefit certain passages from books and articles written by our
Theosophists—those who have a correct idea of Karma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I wish you would, as your literature
seems to be very sparing on this subject?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because it is <i>the</i> most difficult
of all our tenets. Some short time ago there appeared the following
objection from a Christian pen:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Granting that the teaching in regard to Theosophy
is correct, and that ‘man must be his own saviour, must overcome
self and conquer the evil that is in his dual nature, to obtain the
emancipation of his soul,’ what is man to do after he has been awakened
and converted to a certain extent from evil or wickedness? How is he
to get emancipation, or pardon, or the blotting out of the evil or
wickedness he has already done?”</p>
<p class="no-indent">To this Mr. J. H. Connelly replies very
pertinently that no one can hope to “make the theosophical engine run
on the theological track.” As he has it:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“The possibility of shirking individual
responsibility is not among the concepts of Theosophy. In this faith
there is no such thing as pardoning, or ‘blotting out of evil or
wickedness already done,’ otherwise than by the adequate punishment
therefor of the wrong-doer and the restoration of the harmony in the
universe that had been disturbed by his wrongful act. The evil has been
his own, and while others must suffer its consequences, atonement can
be made by nobody but himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“The condition contemplated ... in which a man
shall have been ‘awakened and converted to a certain extent from evil
or wickedness,’ is that in which a man shall have realized that his
deeds are evil and deserving of punishment. In that realization a sense
of personal responsibility is inevitable, and just in proportion to the
extent of his awakening or ‘converting’ must be the sense of that awful
responsibility. While it is strong upon him is the time when he is
urged to accept the doctrine of vicarious atonement.</p>
<p class="blockquot">“He is told that he must also repent, but nothing
is easier than that. It is an amiable weakness of human nature that we
are quite prone to regret the evil we have done when our attention is
called, and we have either suffered from it ourselves or enjoyed its
fruits. Possibly, close analysis of the feeling would show us that that
which we regret is rather the necessity that seemed to require the evil
as a means of attainment of our selfish ends than the evil itself.</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Attractive as this prospect of casting our burden
of sins ‘at the foot of the cross’ may be to the ordinary mind, it does
not commend itself to the Theosophic student. He does not apprehend
why the sinner by attaining knowledge of his evil can thereby merit
any pardon for or the blotting out of his past wickedness; or why
repentance and future right living entitle him to a suspension in his
favour of the universal law of relation between cause and effect. The
results of his evil deeds continue to exist; the suffering caused to
others by his wickedness is not blotted out. The Theosophical student
takes the result of wickedness upon the innocent into his problem. He
considers not only the guilty person, but his victims.</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Evil is an infraction of the laws of harmony
governing the universe, and the penalty thereof must fall upon the
violator of that law himself. Christ uttered the warning, ‘Sin no
more, lest a worse thing come upon thee,’ and St. Paul said, ‘Work out
your own salvation. Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.’
That, by the way, is a fine metaphoric rendering of the sentence of the
Puranas far antedating him—that ‘every man reaps the consequences of
his own acts.’</p>
<p class="blockquot">“This is the principle of the law of Karma which
is taught by Theosophy. Sinnett, in his ‘Esoteric Buddhism,’ rendered
Karma as ‘the law of ethical causation.’ ‘The law of retribution,’ as
Mdme. Blavatsky translates its meaning, is better. It is the power which</p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just though mysterious, leads us on unerring</span>
<span class="i0">Through ways unmarked from guilt to punishment.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="blockquot">“But it is more. It rewards merit as unerringly
and amply as it punishes demerit. It is the outcome of every act, of
thought, word and deed, and by it men mould themselves, their lives
and happenings. Eastern philosophy rejects the idea of a newly created
soul for every baby born. It believes in a limited number of monads,
evolving and growing more and more perfect through their assimilation
of many successive personalities. Those personalities are the product
of Karma and it is by Karma and re-incarnation that the human monad in
time returns to its source—absolute deity.”</p>
<p class="indent">E. D. Walker, in his “Re-incarnation,” offers the
following explanation:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Briefly, the doctrine of Karma is that we have
made ourselves what we are by former actions, and are building our
future eternity by present actions. There is no destiny but what we
ourselves determine. There is no salvation or condemnation except what
we ourselves bring about.... Because it offers no shelter for culpable
actions and necessitates a sterling manliness, it is less welcome to
weak natures than the easy religious tenets of vicarious atonement,
intercession, forgiveness and death-bed conversions.... In the domain
of eternal justice the offence and the punishment are inseparably
connected as the same event, because there is no real distinction
between the action and its outcome.... It is Karma, or our old acts,
that draws us back into earthly life. The spirit’s abode changes
according to its Karma, and this Karma forbids any long continuance in
one condition, because <i>it</i> is always changing. So long as action is
governed by material and selfish motives, just so long must the effect
of that action be manifested in physical rebirths. Only the perfectly
selfless man can elude the gravitation of material life. Few have
attained this, but it is the goal of mankind.”</p>
<p class="indent">And then the writer quotes from the <i>Secret Doctrine</i>:</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Those who believe in Karma have to believe in
destiny, which, from birth to death, every man is weaving, thread by
thread, around himself, as a spider does his cobweb, and this destiny
is guided either by the heavenly voice of the invisible prototype
outside of us, or by our more intimate astral or inner man, who is but
too often the evil genius of the embodied entity called man. Both these
lead on the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the
very beginning of the invisible affray the stern and implacable law of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
compensation steps in and takes its course, faithfully following the
fluctuations. When the last strand is woven, and man is seemingly
enwrapped in the network of his own doing, then he finds himself
completely under the empire of this self-made destiny.... An Occultist
or a philosopher will not speak of the goodness or cruelty of
Providence; but, identifying it with Karma-Nemesis, he will teach
that, nevertheless, it guards the good and watches over them in this
as in future lives; and that it punishes the evil-doer—aye, even to
his seventh re-birth—so long, in short, as the effect of his having
thrown into perturbation even the smallest atom in the infinite world
of harmony has not been finally readjusted. For the only decree of
Karma—an eternal and immutable decree—is absolute harmony in the world
of matter as it is in the world of spirit. It is not, therefore, Karma
that rewards or punishes, but it is we who reward or punish ourselves
according to whether we work with, through and along with nature,
abiding by the laws on which that harmony depends, or—break them. Nor
would the ways of Karma be inscrutable were men to work in union and
harmony, instead of disunion and strife. For our ignorance of those
ways—which one portion of mankind calls the ways of Providence, dark
and intricate; while another sees in them the action of blind fatalism;
and a third simple chance, with neither gods nor devils to guide
them—would surely disappear if we would but attribute all these to
their correct cause.... We stand bewildered before the mystery of our
own making and the riddles of life that we will not solve, and then
accuse the great Sphinx of devouring us. But verily there is not an
accident of our lives, not a misshapen day, or a misfortune, that could
not be traced back to our own doings in this or in another life.... The
law of Karma is inextricably interwoven with that of re-incarnation....
It is only this doctrine that can explain to us the mysterious problem
of good and evil, and reconcile man to the terrible and apparent
injustice of life. Nothing but such certainty can quiet our revolted
sense of justice. For, when one unacquainted with the noble doctrine
looks around him and observes the inequalities of birth and fortune,
of intellect and capacities; when one sees honour paid to fools and
profligates, on whom fortune has heaped her favours by mere privilege
of birth, and their nearest neighbour, with all his intellect and noble
virtues—far more deserving in every way—perishing for want and for lack
of sympathy—when one sees all this and has to turn away, helpless to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
relieve the undeserved suffering, one’s ears ringing and heart aching
with the cries of pain around him—that blessed knowledge of Karma
alone prevents him from cursing life and men as well as their supposed
Creator.... This law, whether conscious or unconscious, predestines
nothing and no one. It exists from and in eternity truly, for it
is eternity itself; and as such, since no act can be coequal with
eternity, it cannot be said to act, for it is action itself. It is not
the wave which drowns the man, but the personal action of the wretch
who goes deliberately and places himself under the impersonal action
of the laws that govern the ocean’s motion. Karma creates nothing, nor
does it design. It is man who plants and creates causes, and Karmic
law adjusts the effects, which adjustment is not an act but universal
harmony, tending ever to resume its original position, like a bough,
which, bent down too forcibly, rebounds with corresponding vigour.
If it happen to dislocate the arm that tried to bend it out of its
natural position, shall we say it is the bough which broke our arm or
that our own folly has brought us to grief? Karma has never sought to
destroy intellectual and individual liberty, like the god invented by
the Monotheists. It has not involved its decrees in darkness purposely
to perplex man, nor shall it punish him who dares to scrutinize its
mysteries. On the contrary, he who unveils through study and meditation
its intricate paths, and throws light on those dark ways, in the
windings of which so many men perish owing to their ignorance of the
labyrinth of life, is working for the good of his fellow-men. Karma is
an absolute and eternal law in the world of manifestation; and as there
can only be one Absolute, as one Eternal, ever-present Cause, believers
in Karma cannot be regarded as atheists or materialists, still less
as fatalists, for Karma is one with the Unknowable, of which it is an
aspect, in its effects in the phenomenal world.”</p>
<p class="indent">Another able Theosophic writer says (<i>Purpose of
Theosophy</i>, by Mrs. P. Sinnett):—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“Every individual is making Karma either good
or bad in each action and thought of his daily round, and is at the
same time working out in this life the Karma brought about by the acts
and desires of the last. When we see people afflicted by congenital
ailments it may be safely assumed that these ailments are the
inevitable results of causes started by themselves in a previous birth.
It may be argued that, as these afflictions are hereditary, they can
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
have nothing to do with a past incarnation; but it must be remembered
that the Ego, the real man, the individuality, has no spiritual origin
in the parentage by which it is re-embodied, but it is drawn by the
affinities which its previous mode of life attracted round it into the
current that carries it, when the time comes for re-birth, to the home
best fitted for the development of those tendencies.... This doctrine
of Karma, when properly understood, is well calculated to guide and
assist those who realize its truth to a higher and better mode of life,
for it must not be forgotten that not only our actions but our thoughts
also are most assuredly followed by a crowd of circumstances that will
influence for good or for evil our own future, and, what is still more
important, the future of many of our fellow-creatures. If sins of
omission and commission could in any case be only self-regarding, the
effect on the sinner’s Karma would be a matter of minor consequence.
The fact that every thought and act through life carries with it for
good or evil a corresponding influence on other members of the human
family renders a strict sense of justice, morality, and unselfishness
so necessary to future happiness or progress. A crime once committed,
an evil thought sent out from the mind, are past recall—no amount of
repentance can wipe out their results in the future. Repentance, if
sincere, will deter a man from repeating errors; it cannot save him
or others from the effects of those already produced, which will most
unerringly overtake him either in this life or in the next re-birth.”</p>
<p class="indent">Mr. J. H. Connelly proceeds—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“The believers in a religion based upon such
doctrine are willing it should be compared with one in which man’s
destiny for eternity is determined by the accidents of a single, brief
earthly existence, during which he is cheered by the promise that ‘as
the tree falls so shall it lie’; in which his brightest hope, when he
wakes up to a knowledge of his wickedness, is the doctrine of vicarious
atonement, and in which even that is handicapped, according to the
Presbyterian Confession of Faith.</p>
<p class="blockquot">“By the decree of God, for the manifestation of
his glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting life
and others foreordained to everlasting death.</p>
<p class="blockquot">“These angels and men thus predestinated and
foreordained are particularly and unchangeably designed; and their
number is so certain and definite that it cannot be either increased
or diminished. ... As God hath appointed the elect unto glory....
Neither are any other redeemed by Christ effectually called, justified,
adopted, sanctified, and saved, but the elect only.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“The rest of mankind God was pleased, according
to the unsearchable counsel of his own will, whereby he extendeth or
withholdeth mercy as he pleaseth, for the glory of his sovereign power
over his creatures, to pass by and to ordain them to dishonour and
wrath for their sin to the praise of his glorious justice.”</p>
<p class="indent">This is what the able defender says. Nor can we do
any better than wind up the subject as he does, by a quotation from a
magnificent poem. As he says:—</p>
<p class="blockquot">“The exquisite beauty of Edwin Arnold’s exposition
of Karma in ‘The Light of Asia’ tempts to its reproduction here, but it
is too long for quotation in full. Here is a portion of it:—</p>

<p class="no-indent"> And now I advise you to compare our Theosophic
views upon Karma, the law of Retribution, and say whether they are
not both more philosophical and just than this cruel and idiotic
dogma which makes of “God” a senseless fiend; the tenet, namely,
that the “elect only” will be saved, and the rest doomed to eternal
perdition!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yes, I see what you mean generally;
but I wish you could give some concrete example of the action of
Karma?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That I cannot do. We can only feel
sure, as I said before, that our present lives and circumstances are
the direct results of our own deeds and thoughts in lives that are
past. But we, who are not Seers or Initiates, cannot know anything
about the details of the working of the law of Karma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can anyone, even an Adept or Seer,
follow out this Karmic process of readjustment in detail?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly: “Those who <i>know</i>” can
do so by the exercise of powers which are latent even in all men.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_11_3"></a>WHO ARE THOSE WHO KNOW?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Does this hold equally of ourselves
as of others?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Equally. As just said, the same
limited vision exists for all, save those who have reached in the
present incarnation the acme of spiritual vision and clairvoyance. We
can only perceive that, if things with us ought to have been different,
they would have been different; that we are what we have made
ourselves, and have only what we have earned for ourselves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I am afraid such a conception would
only embitter us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I believe it is precisely the
reverse. It is disbelief in the just law of retribution that is more
likely to awaken every combative feeling in man. A child, as much
as a man, resents a punishment, or even a reproof he believes to be
unmerited, far more than he does a severer punishment, if he feels that
it is merited. Belief in Karma is the highest reason for reconcilement
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to one’s lot in this life, and the very strongest incentive towards
effort to better the succeeding re-birth. Both of these, indeed, would
be destroyed if we supposed that our lot was the result of anything but
strict <i>Law</i>, or that destiny was in any other hands than our own.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You have just asserted that this
system of Re-incarnation under Karmic law commended itself to reason,
justice, and the moral sense. But, if so, is it not at some sacrifice
of the gentler qualities of sympathy and pity, and thus a hardening of
the finer instincts of human nature?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Only apparently, not really. No
man can receive more or less than his deserts without a corresponding
injustice or partiality to others; and a law which could be averted
through compassion would bring about more misery than it saved,
more irritation and curses than thanks. Remember also, that we do
not administer the law, if we do create causes for its effects; it
administers itself; and again, that the most copious provision for the
manifestation of <i>just</i> compassion and mercy is shown in the state of Devachan.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You speak of Adepts as being an
exception to the rule of our general ignorance. Do they really know
more than we do of Re-incarnation and after states?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They do, indeed. By the training
of faculties we all possess, but which they alone have developed to
perfection, they have entered in spirit these various planes and states
we have been discussing. For long ages, one generation of Adepts
after another has studied the mysteries of being, of life, death,
and re-birth, and all have taught in their turn some of the facts so learned.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And is the production of Adepts the
aim of Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Theosophy considers humanity as
an emanation from divinity on its return path thereto. At an advanced
point upon the path, Adeptship is reached by those who have devoted
several incarnations to its achievement. For, remember well, no man has
ever reached Adeptship in the Secret Sciences in one life; but many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
incarnations are necessary for it after the formation of a conscious
purpose and the beginning of the needful training. Many may be the men
and women in the very midst of our Society who have begun this uphill
work toward illumination several incarnations ago, and who yet, owing
to the personal illusions of the present life, are either ignorant
of the fact, or on the road to losing every chance in this existence
of progressing any farther. They feel an irresistible attraction
toward occultism and the <i>Higher Life</i>, and yet are too personal and
self-opinionated, too much in love with the deceptive allurements of
mundane life and the world’s ephemeral pleasures, to give them up;
and so lose their chance in their present birth. But, for ordinary
men, for the practical duties of daily life, such a far-off result is
inappropriate as an aim and quite ineffective as a motive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What, then, may be their object or
distinct purpose in joining the Theosophical Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Many are interested in our
doctrines and feel instinctively that they are truer than those of any
dogmatic religion. Others have formed a fixed resolve to attain the
highest ideal of man’s duty.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_11_4"></a>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
FAITH AND KNOWLEDGE; <br>OR,  BLIND AND REASONED FAITH.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> You say that they accept and believe
in the doctrines of Theosophy. But, as they do not belong to those
Adepts you have just mentioned, then they must accept your teachings
on <i>blind faith</i>. In what does this differ from that of conventional
religions?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As it differs on almost all the
other points, so it differs on this one. What you call “faith,” and
that which is <i>blind faith</i>, in reality, and with regard to the dogmas
of the Christian religions, becomes with us “<i>knowledge</i>,” the logical
sequence of things <i>we know</i>, about <i>facts</i> in nature. Your Doctrines
are based upon interpretation, therefore, upon the <i>second-hand</i>
testimony of Seers; ours upon the invariable and unvarying testimony of
Seers. The ordinary Christian theology for instance, holds that man is
a creature of God, of three component parts—body, soul, and spirit—all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
essential to his integrity, and all, either in the gross form
of physical earthly existence or in the etherealized form of
post-resurrection experience, needed to so constitute him for ever,
each man having thus a permanent existence separate from other men,
and from the Divine. Theosophy, on the other hand, holds that man,
being an emanation from the Unknown, yet ever present and infinite
Divine Essence, his body and everything else is impermanent, hence
an illusion; Spirit alone in him being the one enduring substance,
and even that losing its separated individuality at the moment of its
complete reunion with the <i>Universal Spirit</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> If we lose even our individuality,
then it becomes simply annihilation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I say it <i>does not</i>, since I speak
of <i>separate</i>, not of universal individuality. The latter becomes as a
part transformed into the whole; the <i>dewdrop</i> is not evaporated, but
becomes the sea. Is physical man <i>annihilated</i>, when from a fœtus he
becomes an old man? What kind of Satanic pride must be ours if we place
our infinitesimally small consciousness and individuality higher than
the universal and infinite consciousness!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> It follows, then, that there is, <i>de
facto</i>, no man, but all is Spirit?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You are mistaken. It thus follows
that the union of Spirit with matter is but temporary; or, to put it
more clearly, since Spirit and matter are one, being the two opposite
poles of the <i>universal</i> manifested substance—that Spirit loses
its right to the name so long as the smallest particle and atom of
its manifesting substance still clings to any form, the result of
differentiation. To believe otherwise is <i>blind faith</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Thus it is on <i>knowledge</i>, not on
<i>faith</i>, that you assert that the permanent principle, the Spirit,
simply makes a transit through matter?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I would put it otherwise and say—we
assert that the appearance of the permanent and one principle, Spirit,
<i>as matter</i> is transient, and, therefore, no better than an illusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Very well; and this, given out on
knowledge not faith?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just so. But as I see very well
what you are driving at, I may just as well tell you that we hold
<i>faith</i>, such as you advocate, to be a mental disease, and real faith,
<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>pistis</i> of the Greeks, as “<i>belief based on knowledge</i>,”
whether supplied by the evidence of physical or <i>spiritual</i> senses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I mean, if it is the difference
between the two that you want to know, then I can tell you that between
<i>faith on authority</i> and <i>faith on one’s spiritual intuition</i>, there is
a very great difference.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What is it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> One is human credulity and
<i>superstition</i>, the other human belief and <i>intuition</i>. As Professor
Alexander Wilder says in his “Introduction to the <i>Eleusinian
Mysteries</i>,” “It is ignorance which leads to profanation. Men ridicule
what they do not properly understand.... The undercurrent of this world
is set towards one goal; and inside of human credulity ... is a power
almost infinite, a holy faith capable of apprehending the supremest
truths of all existence.” Those who limit that “credulity” to human
authoritative dogmas alone, will never fathom that power nor even
perceive it in their natures. It is stuck fast to the external plane
and is unable to bring forth into play the essence that rules it; for
to do this they have to claim their right of private judgment, and this
they never <i>dare</i> to do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And is it that “intuition” which
forces you to reject God as a personal Father, Ruler and Governor of
the Universe?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Precisely. We believe in an ever
unknowable Principle, because blind aberration alone can make one
maintain that the Universe, thinking man, and all the marvels contained
even in the world of matter, could have grown without some <i>intelligent
powers</i> to bring about the extraordinarily wise arrangement of all its
parts. Nature may err, and often does, in its details and the external
manifestations of its materials, never in its inner causes and results.
Ancient pagans held on this question far more philosophical views than
modern philosophers, whether Agnostics, Materialists or Christians; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
no pagan writer has ever yet advanced the proposition that cruelty
and mercy are not finite feelings, and can therefore be made the
attributes of an <i>infinite</i> god. Their gods, therefore, were all
finite. The Siamese author of the <i>Wheel of the Law</i>, expresses
the same idea about your personal god as we do; he says (p. 25):</p>
<p class="blockquot">“A Buddhist might believe in the existence of a
god; sublime above all human qualities and attributes—a perfect god,
above love, and hatred, and jealousy, calmly resting in a quietude
that nothing could disturb, and of such a god he would speak no
disparagement, not from a desire to please him or fear to offend him,
but from natural veneration; but he cannot understand a god with the
attributes and qualities of men, a god who loves and hates, and shows
anger; a Deity who, whether described as by Christian Missionaries or
by Mahometans or Brahmins,<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55_55">[55]</a>
or Jews, falls below his standard of even an ordinary good man.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Faith for faith, is not the faith
of the Christian who believes, in his human helplessness and humility,
that there is a merciful Father in Heaven who will protect him from
temptation, help him in life, and forgive him his transgressions,
better than the cold and proud, almost fatalistic faith of the
Buddhists, Vedantins, and Theosophists?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Persist in calling our belief
“faith” if you will. But once we are again on this ever-recurring
question, I ask in my turn: faith for faith, is not the one based on
strict logic and reason better than the one which is based simply on
human authority or—hero-worship? <i>Our</i> “faith” has all the logical
force of the arithmetical truism that 2 and 2 will produce 4. Your
faith is like the logic of some emotional woman, of whom Tourgenyeff
said that for them 2 and 2 were generally 5, and a tallow candle into
the bargain. Yours is a faith, moreover, which clashes not only with
every conceivable view of justice and logic, but which, if analysed,
leads man to his moral perdition, checks the progress of mankind, and
positively making of might, right—transforms every second man into a
Cain to his brother Abel.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you allude to?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_11_5"></a>HAS GOD THE RIGHT TO FORGIVE?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To the Doctrine of Atonement; I
allude to that dangerous dogma in which you believe, and which teaches
us that no matter how enormous our crimes against the laws of God and
of man, we have but to believe in the self-sacrifice of Jesus for
the salvation of mankind, and his blood will wash out every stain.
It is twenty years that I preach against it, and I may now draw your
attention to a paragraph from <i>Isis Unveiled</i>, written in 1875. This is
what Christianity teaches, and what we combat:—</p>
<p>“God’s mercy is boundless and unfathomable. It is impossible to
conceive of a human sin so damnable that the price paid in advance for
the redemption of the sinner would not wipe it out if a thousandfold
worse. And furthermore, it is never too late to repent. Though the
offender wait until the last minute of the last hour of the last day
of his mortal life, before his blanched lips utter the confession of
faith, he may go to Paradise; the dying thief did it, and so may all
others as vile. These are the assumptions of the Church, and of the
Clergy; assumptions banged at the heads of your countrymen by England’s
favourite preachers, right in the ‘light of the XIXth century,’” this
most paradoxical age of all. Now to what does it lead?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Does it not make the Christian
happier than the Buddhist or Brahmin?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No; not the educated man, at any
rate, since the majority of these have long since virtually lost all
belief in this cruel dogma. But it leads those who still believe in it
more <i>easily to the threshold of every conceivable crime</i>, than any
other I know of. Let me quote to you from <i>Isis</i> once more (<i>vide</i> Vol.
II., pp. 542 and 543)—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">“If we step outside the little circle of creed and
consider the universe as a whole balanced by the exquisite adjustment
of parts, how all sound logic, how the faintest glimmering sense of
Justice, revolts against this Vicarious Atonement! If the criminal
sinned only against himself, and wronged no one but himself; if by
sincere repentance he could cause the obliteration of past events,
not only from the memory of man, but also from that imperishable
record, which no deity—not even the Supremes, of the Supreme—can
cause to disappear, then this dogma might not be incomprehensible.
But to maintain that one may wrong his fellow-man, kill, disturb
the equilibrium of society and the natural order of things, and
then—through cowardice, hope, or compulsion, it matters not—be forgiven
by believing that the spilling of one blood washes out the other blood
spilt—this is preposterous! Can the <i>results</i> of a crime be obliterated
even though the crime itself should be pardoned? The effects of a cause
are never limited to the boundaries of the cause, nor can the results
of crime be confined to the offender and his victim. Every good as well
as evil action has its effects, as palpably as the stone flung into
calm water. The simile is trite, but it is the best ever conceived,
so let us use it. The eddying circles are greater and swifter as the
disturbing object is greater or smaller, but the smallest pebble, nay,
the tiniest speck, makes its ripples. And this disturbance is not alone
visible and on the surface. Below, unseen, in every direction—outward
and downward—drop pushes drop until the sides and bottom are touched
by the force. More, the air above the water is agitated, and this
disturbance passes, as the physicists tell us, from stratum to stratum
out into space forever and ever; an impulse has been given to matter,
and that is never lost, can never be recalled!...</p>
<p class="blockquot">“So with crime, and so with its opposite. The
action may be instantaneous, the effects are eternal. When, after
the stone is once flung into the pond, we can recall it to the hand,
roll back the ripples, obliterate the force expended, restore the
etheric waves to their previous state of non-being, and wipe out every
trace of the act of throwing the missile, so that Time’s record shall
not show that it ever happened, then, <i>then</i> we may patiently hear
Christians argue for the efficacy of this Atonement,”</p>
<p class="no-indent">and—cease to believe in Karmic Law. As it now stands,
we call upon the whole world to decide, which of our two doctrines is
the most appreciative of deific justice, and which is more reasonable,
even on simple human evidence and logic.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet millions believe in the
Christian dogma and are happy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Pure sentimentalism overpowering
their thinking faculties, which no true philanthropist or Altruist will
ever accept. It is not even a dream of selfishness, but a nightmare
of the human intellect. Look where it leads to, and tell me the name
of that pagan country where crimes are more easily committed or
more numerous than in Christian lands. Look at the long and ghastly
annual records of crimes committed in European countries; and behold
Protestant and Biblical America. There, <i>conversions</i> effected in
prisons are more numerous than those made by public <i>revivals</i> and
preaching. See how the ledger-balance of Christian justice (!) stands;
Red-handed murderers, urged on by the demons of lust, revenge,
cupidity, fanaticism, or mere brutal thirst for blood, who kill their
victims, in most cases, without giving them time to repent or call on
Jesus. These, perhaps, died sinful, and, of course—consistently with
theological logic—met the reward of their greater or lesser offences.
But the murderer, overtaken by human justice, is imprisoned, wept over
by sentimentalists, prayed with and at, pronounces the charmed words of
conversion, and goes to the scaffold a redeemed child of Jesus! Except
for the murder, he would not have been prayed with, redeemed, pardoned.
Clearly this man did well to murder, for thus he gained eternal
happiness! And how about the victim and his, or her family, relatives,
dependents, social relations; has justice no recompense for them? Must
they suffer in this world and the next, while he who wronged them sits
beside the “holy thief” of Calvary, and is for ever blessed? On this
question the clergy keep a prudent silence. (<i>Isis Unveiled.</i>) And now
you know why Theosophists—whose fundamental belief and hope is justice
for all, in Heaven as on earth, and in Karma—reject this dogma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> The ultimate destiny of man, then,
is not a Heaven presided over by God, but the gradual transformation of
matter into its primordial element, Spirit?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is to that final goal to which
all tends in nature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do not some of you regard this association
or “fall of spirit into matter” as evil, and re-birth as a sorrow?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Some do, and therefore strive
to shorten their period of probation on earth. It is not an unmixed
evil, however, since it ensures the experience upon which we mount to
knowledge and wisdom. I mean that experience which <i>teaches</i> that the
needs of our spiritual nature can never be met by other than spiritual
happiness. As long as we are in the body, we are subjected to pain,
suffering and all the disappointing incidents occurring during life.
Therefore, and to palliate this, we finally acquire knowledge which
alone can afford us relief and hope of a better future.

<div class="chapter"><a id="SECTION_12_1"></a>
<h2>XII. <br>WHAT IS PRACTICAL THEOSOPHY?</h2></div>
<h3>DUTY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Why, then, the need for rebirths,
since all alike fail to secure a permanent peace?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because the final goal cannot be
reached in any way but through life experiences and because the bulk of
these consist in pain and suffering. It is only through the latter that
we can learn. Joys and pleasures teach us nothing; they are evanescent,
and can only bring in the long run satiety. Moreover, our constant
failure to find any permanent satisfaction in life which would meet the
wants of our higher nature, shows us plainly that those wants can be
met only on their own plane, to-wit—the spiritual.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is the natural result of this a
desire to quit life by one means or another?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If you mean by such desire
“suicide,” then I say, most decidedly not. Such a result can never be
a “natural” one, but is ever due to a morbid brain disease, or to most
decided and strong materialistic views. It is the worst of crimes and
dire in its results. But if by desire, you mean simply aspiration to
reach spiritual existence, not a wish to quit the earth, then I would
call it a very natural desire indeed. Otherwise voluntary death would
be an abandonment of our present post and of the duties incumbent on
us, as well as an attempt to shirk Karmic responsibilities, and thus
involve the creation of new Karma.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if actions on the material plane
are unsatisfying, why should duties, which are such actions, be imperative?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> First of all, because our
philosophy teaches us that the object of doing our duties to all men
and to ourselves the last, is not the attainment of personal happiness,
but of the happiness of others; the fulfilment of right for the sake of
right, not for what it may bring us. Happiness, or rather contentment,
may indeed follow the performance of duty, but is not and must not be
the motive for it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you understand precisely
by “duty” in Theosophy? It cannot be the Christian duties preached by
Jesus and his Apostles, since you recognize neither?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You are once more mistaken. What
you call “Christian duties” were inculcated by every great moral and
religious Reformer ages before the Christian era. All that was great,
generous, heroic, was, in days of old, not only talked about and
preached from pulpits as in our own time, but <i>acted upon</i> sometimes
by whole nations. The history of the Buddhist reform is full of the
most noble and most heroically unselfish acts. “Be ye all of one mind,
having compassion one of another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be
courteous; not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but
contrariwise, blessing” was practically carried out by the followers
of Buddha, several centuries before Peter. The Ethics of Christianity
are grand, no doubt; but as undeniably they are not new, and have
originated as “Pagan” duties.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And how would you define these
duties, or “duty,” in general, as you understand the term?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Duty is that which is <i>due</i> to
Humanity, to our fellow-men, neighbours, family, and especially that
which we owe to all those who are poorer and more helpless than we are
ourselves. This is a debt which, if left unpaid during life, leaves
us spiritually insolvent and moral bankrupts in our next incarnation.
Theosophy is the quintessence of <i>duty</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> So is Christianity when rightly
understood and carried out.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No doubt it is; but then, were it
not a <i>lip-religion</i> in practice, Theosophy would have little to do
amidst Christians. Unfortunately it is but such lip-ethics. Those who
practise their duty towards all, and for duty’s own sake, are few; and
fewer still are those who perform that duty, remaining content with the
satisfaction of their own secret consciousness. It is—
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“ ... the public voice</span>
<span class="i0">Of praise that honours virtue and rewards it,”</span>
</div></div></div>
<p class="no-indent">which is ever uppermost in the minds of the
“world renowned” philanthropists. Modern ethics are beautiful to read
about and hear discussed; but what are words unless converted into
actions? Finally: if you ask me how we understand Theosophical duty
practically and in view of Karma, I may answer you that our duty is to
drink without a murmur to the last drop, whatever contents the cup of
life may have in store for us, to pluck the roses of life only for the
fragrance they may shed on <i>others</i>, and to be ourselves content but
with the thorns, if that fragrance cannot be enjoyed without depriving
some one else of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> All this is very vague. What do you
do more than Christians do?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is not what we members of the
Theosophical Society do—though some of us try our best—but how much
farther Theosophy leads to good than modern Christianity does. I
say—<i>action</i>, enforced action, instead of mere intention and talk. A
man may be what he likes, the most worldly, selfish and hard-hearted
of men, even a deep-dyed rascal, and it will not prevent him from
calling himself a Christian, or others from so regarding him. But
no Theosophist has the right to this name, unless he is thoroughly
imbued with the correctness of Carlyle’s truism: “The end of man is an
<i>action</i> and not a <i>thought</i>, though it were the noblest”—and unless
he sets and models his daily life upon this truth. The profession of a
truth is not yet the enactment of it; and the more beautiful and grand
it sounds, the more loudly virtue or duty is talked about instead of
being acted upon, the more forcibly it will always remind one of the
Dead Sea fruit. <i>Cant</i> is the most loathsome of all vices; and <i>cant</i>
is the most prominent feature of the greatest Protestant country of
this century—England.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you consider as due to humanity at large?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Full recognition of equal rights
and privileges for all, and without distinction of race, colour, social
position, or birth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> When would you consider such due not
given?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> When there is the slightest
invasion of another’s right—be that other a man or a nation; when there
is any failure to show him the same justice, kindness, consideration
or mercy which we desire for ourselves. The whole present system of
politics is built on the oblivion of such rights, and the most fierce
assertion of national selfishness. The French say: “Like master, like
man”; they ought to add, “Like national policy, like citizen.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you take any part in politics?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As a Society, we carefully avoid
them, for the reasons given below. To seek to achieve political reforms
before we have affected a reform in <i>human nature, is like putting new
wine into old bottles</i>. Make men feel and recognise in their innermost
hearts what is their real, true duty to all men, and every old abuse
of power, every iniquitous law in the national policy, based on human,
social or political selfishness, will disappear of itself. Foolish is
the gardener who seeks to weed his flower-bed of poisonous plants by
cutting them off from the surface of the soil, instead of tearing them
out by the roots. No lasting political reform can be ever achieved with
the same selfish men at the head of affairs as of old.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_12_2"></a>THE RELATIONS OF THE T.S. TO POLITICAL REFORMS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> The Theosophical Society is not,
then, a political organization?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly not. It is international
in the highest sense in that its members comprise men and women of all
races, creeds, and forms of thought, who work together for one object,
the improvement of humanity; but as a society it takes absolutely no
part in any national or party politics.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Why is this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just for the reasons I have
mentioned. Moreover, political action must necessarily vary with the
circumstances of the time and with the idiosyncracies of individuals.
While from the very nature of their position as Theosophists the
members of the T.S. are agreed on the principles of Theosophy, or they
would not belong to the society at all, it does not thereby follow
that they agree on every other subject. As a society they can only
act together in matters which are common to all—that is, in Theosophy
itself; as individuals, each is left perfectly free to follow out
his or her particular line of political thought and action, so long
as this does not conflict with Theosophical principles, or hurt the
Theosophical Society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely the T.S. does not stand
altogether aloof from the social questions which are now so fast coming
to the front?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The very principles of the T.S.
are a proof that it does not—or, rather, that most of its members do
not—so stand aloof. If humanity can only be developed mentally and
spiritually by the enforcement, first of all, of the soundest and most
scientific physiological laws, it is the bounden duty of all who strive
for this development to do their utmost to see that those laws shall
be generally carried out. All Theosophists are only too sadly aware
that, in Occidental countries especially, the social condition of large
masses of the people renders it impossible for either their bodies or
their spirits to be properly trained, so that the development of both
is thereby arrested. As this training and development is one of the
express objects of Theosophy, the T.S. is in thorough sympathy and
harmony with all true efforts in this direction.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what do you mean by “true
efforts”? Each social reformer has his own panacea, and each believes
his to be the one and only thing which can improve and save humanity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Perfectly true, and this is the
real reason why so little satisfactory social work is accomplished. In
most of these panaceas there is no really guiding principle, and there
is certainly no one principle which connects them all. Valuable time
and energy are thus wasted; for men, instead of co-operating, strive
one against the other, often, it is to be feared, for the sake of fame
and reward rather than for the great cause which they profess to have
at heart, and which should be supreme in their lives.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How, then, should Theosophical
principles be applied so that social co-operation may be promoted and
true efforts for social amelioration be carried on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Let me briefly remind you what
these principles are—universal Unity and Causation; Human Solidarity;
the Law of Karma; Re-incarnation. These are the four links of the
golden chain which should bind humanity into one family, one universal
Brotherhood.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In the present state of society,
especially in so-called civilized countries, we are continually brought
face to face with the fact that large numbers of people are suffering
from misery, poverty and disease. Their physical condition is wretched,
and their mental and spiritual faculties are often almost dormant.
On the other hand, many persons at the opposite end of the social
scale are leading lives of careless indifference, material luxury,
and selfish indulgence. Neither of these forms of existence is mere
chance. Both are the effects of the conditions which surround those who
are subject to them, and the neglect of social duty on the one side
is most closely connected with the stunted and arrested development
on the other. In sociology, as in all branches of true science, the
law of universal causation holds good. But this causation necessarily
implies, as its logical outcome, that human solidarity on which
Theosophy so strongly insists. If the action of one reacts on the lives
of all, and this is the true scientific idea, then it is only by all
men becoming brothers and all women sisters, and by all practising in
their daily lives true brotherhood and true sisterhood, that the real
human solidarity, which lies at the root of the elevation of the race,
can ever be attained. It is this action and interaction, this true
brotherhood and sisterhood, in which each shall live for all and all
for each, which is one of the fundamental Theosophical principles that
every Theosophist should be bound, not only to teach, but to carry out
in his or her individual life.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> All this is very well as a general
principle, but how would you apply it in a concrete way?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Look for a moment at what you
would call the concrete facts of human society. Contrast the lives
not only of the masses of the people, but of many of those who are
called the middle and upper classes, with what they might be under
healthier and nobler conditions, where justice, kindness, and love were
paramount, instead of the selfishness, indifference, and brutality
which now too often seem to reign supreme. All good and evil things in
humanity have their roots in human character, and this character is,
and has been, conditioned by the endless chain of cause and effect.
But this conditioning applies to the future as well as to the present
and the past. Selfishness, indifference, and brutality can never be
the normal state of the race—to believe so would be to despair of
humanity—and that no Theosophist can do. Progress can be attained, and
only attained, by the development of the nobler qualities. Now, true
evolution teaches us that by altering the surroundings of the organism
we can alter and improve the organism; and in the strictest sense this
is true with regard to man. Every Theosophist, therefore, is bound to
do his utmost to help on, by all the means in his power, every wise and
well-considered social effort which has for its object the amelioration
of the condition of the poor. Such efforts should be made with a view
to their ultimate social emancipation, or the development of the sense of duty
in those who now so often neglect it in nearly every relation of life.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Agreed. But who is to decide whether
social efforts are wise or unwise?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No one person and no society can
lay down a hard-and-fast rule in this respect. Much must necessarily
be left to the individual judgment. One general test may, however, be
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
given. Will the proposed action tend to promote that true brotherhood
which it is the aim of Theosophy to bring about? No real Theosophist
will have much difficulty in applying such a test; once he is satisfied
of this, his duty will lie in the direction of forming public opinion.
And this can be attained only by inculcating those higher and nobler
conceptions of public and private duties which lie at the root of
all spiritual and material improvement. In every conceivable case he
himself must be a center of spiritual action, and from him and his own
daily individual life must radiate those higher spiritual forces which
alone can regenerate his fellow-men.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why should he do this? Are not
he and all, as you teach, conditioned by their Karma, and must not
Karma necessarily work itself out on certain lines?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is this very law of Karma which
gives strength to all that I have said. The individual cannot separate
himself from the race, nor the race from the individual. The law of
Karma applies equally to all, although all are not equally developed.
In helping on the development of others, the Theosophist believes that
he is not only helping them to fulfil their Karma, but that he is also,
in the strictest sense, fulfilling his own. It is the development of
humanity, of which both he and they are integral parts, that he has
always in view, and he knows that any failure on his part to respond
to the highest within him retards not only himself but all, in their
progressive march. By his actions, he can make it either more difficult
or more easy for humanity to attain the next higher plane of being.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How does this bear on the fourth of
the principles you mentioned, viz., Re-incarnation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The connection is most intimate.
If our present lives depend upon the development of certain principles
which are a growth from the germs left by a previous existence, the law
holds good as regards the future. Once grasp the idea that universal
causation is not merely present, but past, present and future, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
every action on our present plane falls naturally and easily into
its true place, and is seen in its true relation to ourselves and
to others. Every mean and selfish action sends us backward and not
forward, while every noble thought and every unselfish deed are
stepping-stones to the higher and more glorious planes of being. If
this life were all, then in many respects it would indeed be poor and
mean; but regarded as a preparation for the next sphere of existence,
it may be used as the golden gate through which we may pass, not
selfishly and alone, but in company with our fellows, to the palaces
which lie beyond.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_12_3"></a>ON SELF-SACRIFICE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is equal justice to all and love to
every creature the highest standard of Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No; there is an even far higher
one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What can it be?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The giving to others <i>more</i> than to
oneself—<i>self-sacrifice</i>. Such was the standard and abounding measure
which marked so pre-eminently the greatest Teachers and Masters of
Humanity—<i>e.g.</i>, Gautama Buddha in History, and Jesus of Nazareth as
in the Gospels. This trait alone was enough to secure to them the
perpetual reverence and gratitude of the generations of men that come
after them. We say, however, that self-sacrifice has to be performed
with discrimination; and such a self-abandonment, if made without
justice, or blindly, regardless of subsequent results, may often prove
not only made in vain, but harmful. One of the fundamental rules
of Theosophy is, justice to oneself—viewed as a unit of collective
humanity, not as a personal self-justice, not more but not less than
to others; unless, indeed, by the sacrifice of the <i>one</i> self we can
benefit the many.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Could you make your idea clearer by
giving an instance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> There are many instances to
illustrate it in history. Self-sacrifice for practical good to
save many, or several people, Theosophy holds as far higher than
self-abnegation for a sectarian idea, such as that of “saving the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
heathen from <i>damnation</i>,” for instance. In our opinion, Father Damien, the
young man of thirty who offered his whole life in sacrifice
for the benefit and alleviation of the sufferings of the
lepers at Molokai, and who went to live for eighteen years
alone with them, to finally catch the loathsome disease and
die, <i>has not died in vain</i>. He has given relief and relative
happiness to thousands of miserable wretches. He has brought
to them consolation, mental and physical. He threw a streak
of light into the black and dreary night of an existence, the
hopelessness of which is unparalleled in the records of human
suffering. He was a <i>true Theosophist</i>, and his memory will live
for ever in our annals. In our sight this poor Belgian priest
stands immeasurably higher than—for instance—all those sincere
but vain-glorious fools, the Missionaries who have sacrificed
their lives in the South Sea Islands or China. What good have
they done? They went in one case to those who are not yet ripe
for any truth; and in the other to a nation whose systems of
religious philosophy are as grand as any, if only the men who
have them would live up to the standard of Confucius and their
other sages. And they died victims of irresponsible cannibals
and savages, and of popular fanaticism and hatred. Whereas, by
going to the slums of Whitechapel or some other such locality
of those that stagnate right under the blazing sun of our
civilization, full of Christian savages and mental leprosy,
they might have done real good, and preserved their lives for a
better and worthier cause.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But the Christians do not think so?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Of course not, because they act
on an erroneous belief. They think that by baptising the body of an
irresponsible savage they save his soul from damnation. One church
forgets her martyrs, the other beatifies and raises statues to such
men as Labro, who sacrificed his body for forty years only to benefit
the vermin which it bred. Had we the means to do so, we would raise a
statue to Father Damien, the true, practical saint, and perpetuate his
memory for ever as a living exemplar of Theosophical heroism and of
Buddha- and Christ-like mercy and self-sacrifice.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then you regard self-sacrifice as a duty?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We do; and explain it by showing
that altruism is an integral part of self-development. But we have to
discriminate. A man has no right to starve himself <i>to death</i> that
another man may have food, unless the life of that man is obviously
more useful to the many than is his own life. But it is his duty to
sacrifice his own comfort, and to work for others if they are unable to
work for themselves. It is his duty to give all that which is wholly
his own and can benefit no one but himself if he selfishly keeps it
from others. Theosophy teaches self-abnegation, but does not teach rash
and useless self-sacrifice, nor does it justify fanaticism.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how are we to reach such an
elevated status?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> By the enlightened application of
our precepts to practice. By the use of our higher reason, spiritual
intuition and moral sense, and by following the dictates of what we
call “the still small voice” of our conscience, which is that of our
<span class="smcap">Ego</span>, and which speaks louder in us than the
earthquakes and the thunders of Jehovah, wherein “the Lord is not.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> If such are our duties to humanity
at large, what do you understand by our duties to our immediate
surroundings?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just the same, plus those that
arise from special obligations with regard to family ties.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then it is not true, as it is said,
that no sooner does a man enter into the Theosophical Society than he
begins to be gradually severed from his wife, children, and family duties?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is a groundless calumny, like
so many others. The first of the Theosophical duties is to do one’s
duty by <i>all</i> men, and especially by those to whom one’s <i>specific</i>
responsibilities are due, because one has either voluntarily undertaken
them, such as marriage ties, or because one’s destiny has allied one to
them; I mean those we owe to parents or next of kin.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what may be the duty of a
Theosophist to himself?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To control and conquer, <i>through
the Higher, the lower self</i>. To purify himself inwardly and morally;
to fear no one, and nought, save the tribunal of his own conscience.
Never to do a thing by halves; <i>i.e.</i>, if he thinks it the right thing
to do, let him do it openly and boldly, and if wrong, never touch it at
all. It is the duty of a Theosophist to lighten his burden by thinking
of the wise aphorism of Epictetus, who says: “Be not diverted from your
duty <i>by any idle reflection the silly world may make upon you</i>, for
their censures are not in your power, and consequently should not be
any part of your concern.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But suppose a member of your Society
should plead inability to practice altruism by other people, on the
ground that “charity begins at home”; urging that he is too busy, or
too poor, to benefit mankind or even any of its units—what are your
rules in such a case?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No man has a right to say that
he can do nothing for others, on any pretext whatever. “By doing the
proper duty in the proper place, a man may make the world his debtor,”
says an English writer. A cup of cold water given in time to a thirsty
wayfarer is a nobler duty and more worth, than a dozen of dinners given
away, out of season, to men who can afford to pay for them. No man who
has not got it in him will ever become a <i>Theosophist</i>; but he may
remain a member of our Society all the same. We have no rules by which
we could force any man to become a practical Theosophist, if he does
not desire to be one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then why does he enter the Society
at all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That is best known to him who does
so. For, here again, we have no right to pre-judge a person, not even
if the voice of a whole community should be against him, and I may
tell you why. In our day, <i>vox populi</i> (so far as regards the voice of
the educated, at any rate) is no longer <i>vox dei</i>, but ever that of
prejudice, of selfish motives, and often simply that of unpopularity.
Our duty is to sow seeds broadcast for the future, and see they are
good; not to stop to enquire <i>why</i> we should do so, and how and
wherefore we are obliged to lose our time, since those who will reap
the harvest in days to come will never be ourselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_12_4"></a>ON CHARITY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How do you Theosophists regard the
Christian duty of charity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What charity do you mean? Charity
of mind, or practical charity in the physical plane?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I mean practical charity, as your
idea of Universal brotherhood would include, of course, charity of
mind.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then you have in your mind the
practical carrying out of the commandments given by Jesus in the Sermon
on the Mount?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Precisely so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then why call them “Christian”?
Because, although your Saviour preached and practised them, the last
thing the Christians of to-day think of is to carry them out in their
lives.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And yet many are those who pass
their lives in dispensing charity?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Yes, out of the surplus of their
great fortunes. But point out to me that Christian, among the most
philanthropic, who would give to the shivering and starving thief, who
would steal his coat, his cloak also; or offer his right cheek to him
who smote him on the left, and never think of resenting it!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Ah, but you must remember that these
precepts have not to be taken literally. Times and circumstances have
changed since Christ’s day. Moreover, He spoke in Parables.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then why don’t your Churches teach
that the doctrine of damnation and hell-fire is to be understood as
a <i>parable</i> too? Why do some of your most popular preachers, while
virtually allowing these “parables” to be understood as you take them,
insist on the literal meaning of the fires of Hell and the <i>physical</i>
tortures of an “Asbestos-like” soul? If one is a “parable,” then the
other is. If Hell-fire is a literal truth, then Christ’s commandments
in the Sermon on the Mount have to be obeyed to the very letter. And I
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
tell you that many who do not
believe in the Divinity of Christ—like Count Leo Tolstoi and
more than one Theosophist—do carry out these noble, because
universal, precepts literally; and many more good men and women
would do so, were they not more than certain that such a walk
in life would very probably land them in a lunatic asylum—so
<i>Christian are your laws</i>!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely every one knows that
millions and millions are spent annually on private and public
charities?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Oh, yes; half of which sticks to
the hands it passes through before getting to the needy; while a good
portion or remainder gets into the hands of professional beggars, those
who are too lazy to work, thus doing no good whatever to those who are
really in misery and suffering. Haven’t you heard that the first result
of the great outflow of charity towards the East-end of London was to
raise the rents in <i>Whitechapel</i> by some 20 per cent.?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What would you do, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Act individually and not
collectively; follow the Northern Buddhist precepts: “Never put food
into the mouth of the hungry by the hand of another”; “Never let the
shadow of thy neighbour (<i>a third person</i>) come between thyself and the
object of thy bounty”; “Never give to the Sun time to dry a tear before
thou hast wiped it.” Again “Never give money to the needy, or food to
the priest, who begs at thy door, <i>through thy servants</i>, lest thy
money should diminish gratitude, and thy food turn to gall.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how can this be applied practically?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The Theosophical ideas of charity
mean <i>personal</i> exertion for others; <i>personal</i> mercy and kindness;
<i>personal</i> interest in the welfare of those who suffer; <i>personal</i>
sympathy, forethought and assistance in their troubles or needs. We
Theosophists do not believe in giving money (N.B., if we had it)
through other people’s hands or organizations. We believe in giving
to the money a thousandfold greater power and effectiveness by our
personal contact and sympathy with those who need it. We believe in
relieving the starvation of the soul, as much if not more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
emptiness of the stomach; for gratitude does more good to the man
who feels it, than to him for whom it is felt. Where’s the gratitude
which your “millions of pounds” should have called forth, or the
good feelings provoked by them? Is it shown in the hatred of the
East-End poor for the rich? in the growth of the party of anarchy and
disorder? or by those thousands of unfortunate working girls, victims
to the “sweating” system, driven daily to eke out a living by going
on the streets? Do your helpless old men and women thank you for the
workhouses; or your poor for the poisonously unhealthy dwellings
in which they are allowed to breed new generations of diseased,
scrofulous and rickety children, only to put money into the pockets
of the insatiable Shylocks who own houses? Therefore it is that every
sovereign of all those “millions,” contributed by good and would-be
charitable people, falls like a burning curse instead of a blessing
on the poor whom it should relieve. We call this <i>generating national
Karma</i>, and terrible will be its results on the day of reckoning.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_12_5"></a>THEOSOPHY FOR THE MASSES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And you think that Theosophy would,
by stepping in, help to remove these evils, under the practical and
adverse conditions of our modern life?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Had we more money, and had not most
of the Theosophists to work for their daily bread, I firmly believe we
could.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How? Do you expect that your
doctrines could ever take hold of the uneducated masses, when they
are so abstruse and difficult that well-educated people can hardly
understand them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You forget one thing, which is
that your much-boasted modern education is precisely that which makes
it difficult for you to understand Theosophy. Your mind is so full of
intellectual subtleties and preconceptions that your natural intuition
and perception of the truth cannot act. It does not require metaphysics
or education to make a man understand the broad truths of Karma and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Re-incarnation. Look at the millions of poor and uneducated Buddhists
and Hindoos, to whom Karma and re-incarnation are solid realities,
simply because their minds have never been cramped and distorted by
being forced into an unnatural groove. They have never had the innate
human sense of justice perverted in them by being told to believe
that their sins would be forgiven because another man had been put to
death for their sakes. And the Buddhists, note well, live up to their
beliefs without a murmur against Karma, or what they regard as a just
punishment, whereas, the Christian populace neither lives up it to
its moral ideal, nor accepts its lot contentedly. Hence murmuring and
dissatisfaction, and the intensity of the struggle for existence in
Western lands.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this contentedness, which you
praise so much, would do away with all motive for exertion and bring
progress to a stand-still.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And we, Theosophists, say that
your vaunted progress and civilization are no better than a host of
will-o’-the-wisps, flickering over a marsh which exhales a poisonous
and deadly miasma. This, because we see selfishness, crime, immorality,
and all the evils imaginable, pouncing upon unfortunate mankind from
this Pandora’s box which you call an age of progress, and increasing
<i>pari passu</i> with the growth of your material civilization. At such a
price, better the inertia and inactivity of Buddhist countries, which
have arisen only as a consequence of ages of political slavery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then is all this metaphysics and
mysticism with which you occupy yourself so much, of no importance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To the masses, who need only
practical guidance and support, they are not of much consequence;
but for the educated, the natural leaders of the masses, those whose
modes of thought and action will sooner or later be adopted by those
masses, they are of the greatest importance. It is only by means of
the philosophy that an intelligent and educated man can avoid the
intellectual suicide of believing on blind faith; and it is only
by assimilating the strict continuity and logical coherence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Eastern, if not esoteric, doctrines, that he can realize their truth.
Conviction breeds enthusiasm, and “Enthusiasm,” says Bulwer Lytton, “is
the genius of sincerity, and truth accomplishes no victories without
it”; while Emerson most truly remarks that “every great and commanding
movement in the annals of the world is the triumph of enthusiasm.” And
what is more calculated to produce such a feeling than a philosophy so
grand, so consistent, so logical, and so all-embracing as our Eastern Doctrines?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And yet its enemies are very
numerous, and every day Theosophy acquires new opponents.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And this is precisely that which
proves its intrinsic excellence and value. People hate only the things
they fear, and no one goes out of his way to overthrow that which
neither threatens nor rises beyond mediocrity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you hope to impart this
enthusiasm, one day, to the masses?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Why not? since history tells us
that the masses adopted Buddhism with enthusiasm, while, as said
before, the practical effect upon them of this philosophy of ethics
is still shown by the smallness of the percentage of crime amongst
Buddhist populations as compared with every other religion. The
chief point is, to uproot that most fertile source of all crime and
immorality—the belief that it is possible for them to escape the
consequences of their own actions. Once teach them that greatest of all
laws, <i>Karma</i> and <i>Re-incarnation</i>, and besides feeling in themselves
the true dignity of human nature, they will turn from evil and eschew
it as they would a physical danger.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_12_6"></a>HOW MEMBERS CAN HELP THE SOCIETY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How do you expect the Fellows of
your Society to help in the work?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> First by studying and comprehending
the theosophical doctrines, so that they may teach others, especially
the young people. Secondly, by taking every opportunity of talking to
others and explaining to them what Theosophy is, and what it is not; by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
removing misconceptions and spreading an interest in the subject.
Thirdly, by assisting in circulating our literature, by buying books
when they have the means, by lending and giving them and by inducing
their friends to do so. Fourthly, by defending the Society from the
unjust aspersions cast upon it, by every legitimate device in their
power. Fifth, and most important of all, by the example of their own
lives.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But all this literature, to the
spread of which you attach so much importance, does not seem to me
of much practical use in helping mankind. This is not practical
charity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We think otherwise. We hold that a
good book which gives people food for thought, which strengthens and
clears their minds, and enables them to grasp truths which they have
dimly felt but could not formulate—we hold that such a book does a
real, substantial good. As to what you call practical deeds of charity,
to benefit the bodies of our fellow-men, we do what little we can; but,
as I have already told you, most of us are poor, whilst the Society
itself has not even the money to pay a staff of workers. All of us who
toil for it, give our labour gratis, and in most cases money as well.
The few who have the means of doing what are usually called charitable
actions, follow the Buddhist precepts and do their work themselves,
not by proxy or by subscribing publicly to charitable funds. What the
Theosophist has to do above all is to forget his personality.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_12_7"></a>WHAT A THEOSOPHIST OUGHT NOT TO DO.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Have you any prohibitory laws or
clauses for Theosophists in your Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Many, but, alas! none of them are
enforced. They express the ideal of our organization,—but the practical
application of such things we are compelled to leave to the discretion
of the Fellows themselves. Unfortunately, the state of men’s minds
in the present century is such that, unless we allow these clauses
to remain, so to speak, obsolete, no man or woman would dare to risk
joining the Theosophical Society. This is precisely why I feel forced
to lay such a stress on the difference between true Theosophy and its
hard-struggling and well-intentioned, but still unworthy vehicle, the
Theosophical Society.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> May I be told what are these
perilous reefs in the open sea of Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Well may you call them reefs,
as more than one otherwise sincere and well-meaning F.T.S. has had
his Theosophical canoe shattered into splinters on them! And yet to
avoid certain things seems the easiest thing in the world to do. For
instance, here is a series of such negatives, screening positive
Theosophical duties:—</p>
<p class="indent">No Theosophist should be silent when he hears evil
reports or slanders spread about the Society, or innocent persons,
whether they be his colleagues or outsiders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But suppose what one hears is the
truth, or may be true without one knowing it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then you must demand good proofs of
the assertion, and hear both sides impartially before you permit the
accusation to go uncontradicted. You have no right to believe in evil,
until you get undeniable proof of the correctness of the statement.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what should you do then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Pity and forbearance, charity and
long-suffering, ought to be always there to prompt us to excuse our
sinning brethren, and to pass the gentlest sentence possible upon
those who err. A Theosophist ought never to forget what is due to the
shortcomings and infirmities of human nature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Ought he to forgive entirely in such
cases?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In every case, especially he who is
sinned against.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if by so doing, he risks to
injure, or allow others to be injured? What ought he to do then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> His duty; that which his conscience
and higher nature suggests to him; but only after mature deliberation.
Justice consists in doing no injury to any living being; but justice
commands us also never to allow injury to be done to the many, or even
to one innocent person, by allowing the guilty one to go unchecked.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are the other negative clauses?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No Theosophist ought to be
contented with an idle or frivolous life, doing no real good to himself
and still less to others. He should work for the benefit of the few who
need his help if he is unable to toil for Humanity, and thus work for
the advancement of the Theosophical cause.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This demands an exceptional nature,
and would come rather hard upon some persons.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then they had better remain outside
the T. S. instead of sailing under false colours. No one is asked
to give more than he can afford, whether in devotion, time, work or
money.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What comes next?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No working member should set too
great value on his personal progress or proficiency in Theosophic
studies; but must be prepared rather to do as much altruistic work as
lies in his power. He should not leave the whole of the heavy burden
and responsibility of the Theosophical movement on the shoulders of
the few devoted workers. Each member ought to feel it his duty to take
what share he can in the common work, and help it by every means in his
power.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This is but just. What comes next?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No Theosophist should place his
personal vanity, or feelings, above those of his Society as a body.
He who sacrifices the latter, or other people’s reputations on the
altar of his personal vanity, worldly benefit, or pride, ought not to
be allowed to remain a member. One cancerous limb diseases the whole
body.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is it the duty of every member to
teach others and preach Theosophy?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is indeed. No fellow has a right
to remain idle, on the excuse that he knows too little to teach. For he
may always be sure that he will find others who know still less than
himself. And also it is not until a man begins to try to teach others, that he
discovers his own ignorance and tries to remove it. But this is a minor clause.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What do you consider, then, to be
the chief of these negative Theosophical duties?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> To be ever prepared to recognize
and confess one’s faults. To rather sin through exaggerated praise than
through too little appreciation of one’s neighbour’s efforts. Never to
back-bite or slander another person. Always to say openly and direct to
his face anything you have against him. Never to make yourself the echo
of anything you may hear against another, nor harbour revenge against
those who happen to injure you.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But it is often dangerous to tell
people the truth to their faces. Don’t you think so? I know of one of
your members who was bitterly offended, left the Society, and became
its greatest enemy, only because he was told some unpleasant truths to
his face, and was blamed for them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Of such we have had many. No
member, whether prominent or insignificant, has ever left us without
becoming our bitter enemy.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> How do you account for it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is simply this. Having been,
in most cases, intensely devoted to the Society at first, and having
lavished upon it the most exaggerated praises, the only possible excuse
such a backslider can make for his subsequent behaviour and past
short-sightedness, is <i>to pose as an innocent and deceived victim</i>,
thus casting the blame from his own shoulders on to those of the
Society in general, and its leaders especially. Such persons remind
one of the old fable about the man with a distorted face, who broke
his looking-glass on the ground that it reflected his countenance crookedly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what makes these people turn
against the Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Wounded vanity in some form or
other, almost in every case. Generally, because their dicta and advice
are not taken as final and authoritative; or else, because they are of
those who would rather reign in Hell than serve in Heaven. Because, in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
short, they cannot bear to stand second to anybody in anything. So, for
instance, one member—a true “Sir Oracle”—criticized, and almost defamed
every member in the T.S. to outsiders as much as to Theosophists, under
the pretext that they were <i>all untheosophical</i>, blaming them precisely
for what he was himself doing all the time. Finally, he left the
Society, giving as his reason a profound conviction that we were all
(the Founders especially)—<span class="smcap">Frauds!</span> Another
one, after intriguing in every possible way to be placed at the head
of a large Section of the Society, finding that the members would not
have him, turned against the Founders of the T. S., and became their
bitterest enemy, denouncing one of them whenever he could, simply
because the latter could not, and would not, <i>force him</i> upon the
Members. This was simply a case of an outrageous wounded vanity. Still
another wanted to, and virtually did, practise <i>black-magic</i>—<i>i.e.</i>,
undue personal psychological influence on certain Fellows, while
pretending devotion and every Theosophical virtue. When this was put
a stop to, the Member broke with Theosophy, and now slanders and
lies against the same hapless leaders in the most virulent manner,
endeavouring to break up the society by blackening the reputation of
those whom that worthy “Fellow” was unable to deceive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What would you do with such
characters?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Leave them to their Karma. Because
one person does evil that is no reason for others to do so.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But, to return to slander, where is
the line of demarcation between backbiting and just criticism to be
drawn? Is it not one’s duty to warn one’s friends and neighbors against
those whom one knows to be dangerous associates?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If by allowing them to go on
unchecked other persons may be thereby injured, it is certainly our
duty to obviate the danger by warning them privately. But true or
false, no accusation against another person should ever be spread
abroad. If true, and the fault hurts no one but the sinner, then leave
him to his Karma. If false, then you will have avoided adding to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the injustice of the world. Therefore, keep silent about such things
with every one not directly concerned. But if your discretion and
silence are likely to hurt or endanger others, then I add: <i>Speak the
truth at all costs</i>, and say, with Annesly, “Consult duty, not events.”
There are cases when one is forced to exclaim, “Perish discretion,
rather than allow it to interfere with duty.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Methinks, if you carry out these
maxims, you are likely to reap a nice crop of troubles!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And so we do. We have to admit that
we are now open to the same taunt as the early Christians were. “See,
how these Theosophists love one another!” may now be said of us without
a shadow of injustice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Admitting yourself that there is at
least as much, if not more, backbiting, slandering, and quarrelling
in the T.S. as in the Christian Churches, let alone Scientific
Societies—What kind of Brotherhood is this? I may ask.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> A very poor specimen, indeed, as
at present, and, until carefully sifted and reorganized, <i>no</i> better
than all others. Remember, however, that human nature is the same <i>in</i>
the Theosophical Society as <i>out</i> of it. Its members are no saints:
they are at best sinners trying to do better, and liable to fall back
owing to personal weakness. Add to this that our “Brotherhood” is no
“recognised” or established body, and stands, so to speak, outside of
the pale of jurisdiction. Besides which, it is in a chaotic condition,
and as unjustly <i>unpopular as is no other body</i>. What wonder, then,
that those members who fail to carry out its ideal should turn, after
leaving the Society, for sympathetic protection to our enemies, and
pour all their gall and bitterness into their too willing ears! Knowing
that they will find support, sympathy, and ready credence for every
accusation, however absurd, that it may please them to launch against
the Theosophical Society, they hasten to do so, and vent their wrath
on the innocent looking-glass, which reflected too faithfully their
faces. <i>People never forgive those whom they have wronged.</i> The sense
of kindness received, and repaid by them with ingratitude, drives them
into a madness of self-justification before the world and their own
consciences. The former is but too ready to believe in anything said
against a society it hates. The latter—but I will say no more, fearing
I have already said too much.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Your position does not seem to me a
very enviable one.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is not. But don’t you think that
there must be something very noble, very exalted, very true, behind the
Society and its philosophy, when the leaders and the founders of the
movement still continue to work for it with all their strength? They
sacrifice to it all comfort, all worldly prosperity, and success, even
to their good name and reputation—aye, even to their honour—to receive
in return incessant and ceaseless obloquy, relentless persecution,
untiring slander, constant ingratitude, and misunderstanding of their
best efforts, blows, and buffets from all sides—when by simply dropping
their work they would find themselves immediately released from every
responsibility, shielded from every further attack.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I confess, such a perseverance seems
to me very astounding, and I wondered why you did all this.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Believe me for no
self-gratification; only in the hope of training a few individuals
to carry on our work for humanity by its original programme when the
Founders are dead and gone. They have already found a few such noble
and devoted souls to replace them. The coming generations, thanks to
these few, will find the path to peace a little less thorny, and the
way a little widened, and thus all this suffering will have produced
good results, and their self-sacrifice will not have been in vain. At
present, the main, fundamental object of the Society is to sow germs in
the hearts of men, which may in time sprout, and under more propitious
circumstances lead to a healthy reform, conducive of more happiness <i>to
the masses</i> than they have hitherto enjoyed.

<h2>XIII. <br>ON THE MISCONCEPTIONS
ABOUT<br> THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.</h2></div>
<h3>THEOSOPHY AND ASCETICISM.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have heard people say that your
rules require all members to be vegetarians, celibates, and rigid
ascetics; but you have not told me anything of the sort yet. Can you
tell the truth once for all about this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The truth is that our rules require
nothing of the kind. The Theosophical Society does not even expect, far
less require of <i>any</i> of its members that they should be ascetics in
any way, except—if you call <i>that</i> asceticism—that they should try and
benefit other people and be unselfish in their own lives.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But still many of your members
are strict vegetarians, and openly avow their intention of remaining
unmarried. This, too, is most often the case with those who take a
prominent part in connection with the work of your Society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> That is only natural, because most
of our really earnest workers are members of the Inner Section of the
Society, which I told you about before.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Oh! then you do require ascetic
practices in that Inner Section?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No; we do not <i>require</i> or <i>enjoin</i>
them even there; but I see that I had better give you an explanation of
our views on the subject of asceticism in general, and then you will
understand about vegetarianism and so on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Please proceed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As I have already told you, most
people who become really earnest students of Theosophy, and active
workers in our Society, wish to do more than study theoretically the
truths we teach. They wish to <i>know</i> the truth by their own direct
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
personal experience, and to study Occultism with the object of
acquiring the wisdom and power, which they feel that they need in order
to help others, effectually and judiciously, instead of blindly and at
haphazard. Therefore, sooner or later, they join the Inner Section.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But you said that “ascetic
practices” are not obligatory even in that Inner Section?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No more they are; but the first
thing which the members learn there is a true conception of the
relation of the body, or physical sheath, to the inner, the true man.
The relation and mutual interaction between these two aspects of human
nature are explained and demonstrated to them, so that they soon become
imbued with the supreme importance of the inner man over the outer case
or body. They are taught that blind unintelligent asceticism is mere
folly; that such conduct as that of St. Labro which I spoke of before,
or that of the Indian Fakirs and jungle ascetics, who cut, burn and
macerate their bodies in the most cruel and horrible manner, is simply
self-torture for selfish ends, <i>i.e.</i>, to develop will-power, but is
perfectly useless for the purpose of assisting true spiritual, or
Theosophic, development.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I see, you regard only <i>moral</i>
asceticism as necessary. It is as a means to an end, that end being the
perfect equilibrium of the <i>inner</i> nature of man, and the attainment of
complete mastery over the body with all its passions and desires?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just so. But these means must be
used intelligently and wisely, not blindly and foolishly; like an
athlete who is training and preparing for a great contest, not like the
miser who starves himself into illness that he may gratify his passion
for gold.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I understand now your general idea;
but let us see how you apply it in practice. How about vegetarianism,
for instance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> One of the great German scientists
has shown that every kind of animal tissue, however you may cook it,
still retains certain marked characteristics of the animal which it
belonged to, which characteristics can be recognised. And apart
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
from that, every one knows by the taste what meat he is eating. We go a
step farther, and prove that when the flesh of animals is assimilated
by man as food, it imparts to him, physiologically, some of the
characteristics of the animal it came from. Moreover, occult science
teaches and proves this to its students by ocular demonstration,
showing also that this “coarsening” or “animalizing” effect on man is
greatest from the flesh of the larger animals, less for birds, still
less for fish and other cold-blooded animals, and least of all when he
eats only vegetables.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then he had better not eat at all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If he could live without eating, of
course it would. But as the matter stands, he must eat to live, and so
we advise really earnest students to eat such food as will least clog
and weight their brains and bodies, and will have the smallest effect
in hampering and retarding the development of their intuition, their
inner faculties and powers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then you do not adopt all the
arguments which vegetarians in general are in the habit of using?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly not. Some of their
arguments are very weak, and often based on assumptions which are quite
false. But, on the other hand, many of the things they say are quite
true. For instance, we believe that much disease, and especially the
great predisposition to disease which is becoming so marked a feature
in our time, is very largely due to the eating of meat, and especially
of tinned meats. But it would take too long to go thoroughly into this
question of vegetarianism on its merits; so please pass on to something
else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> One question more. What are your members
of the Inner Section to do with regard to their food when they are ill?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Follow the best practical advice
they can get, of course. Don’t you grasp yet that we never impose any
hard-and-fast obligations in this respect? Remember once for all that
in all such questions we take a rational, and never a fanatical, view
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
of things. If from illness or long habit a man cannot go without meat,
why, by all means let him eat it. It is no crime; it will only retard
his progress a little; for after all is said and done, the purely
bodily actions and functions are of far less importance than what a
man <i>thinks</i> and <i>feels</i>, what desires he encourages in his mind, and
allows to take root and grow there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then with regard to the use of wine
and spirits, I suppose you do not advise people to drink them?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are worse for his moral and
spiritual growth than meat, for alcohol in all its forms has a direct,
marked, and very deleterious influence on man’s psychic condition. Wine
and spirit drinking is only less destructive to the development of the
inner powers, than the habitual use of hashish, opium, and similar drugs.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_13_2"></a>THEOSOPHY AND MARRIAGE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Now to another question; must a man
marry or remain a celibate?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It depends on the kind of man you
mean. If you refer to one who intends to live <i>in</i> the world, one who,
even though a good, earnest Theosophist, and an ardent worker for our
cause, still has ties and wishes which bind him to the world, who, in
short, does not feel that he has done for ever with what men call life,
and that he desires one thing and one thing only—to know the truth,
and to be able to help others—then for such a one I say there is no
reason why he should not marry, if he likes to take the risks of that
lottery where there are so many more blanks than prizes. Surely you
cannot believe us so absurd and fanatical as to preach against marriage
altogether? On the contrary, save in a few exceptional cases of
practical Occultism, marriage is the only remedy against immorality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why cannot one acquire this
knowledge and power when living a married life?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> My dear sir, I cannot go into
physiological questions with you; but I can give you an obvious and, I
think, a sufficient answer, which will explain to you the moral
reasons we give for it. Can a man serve two masters? No! Then it is
equally impossible for him to divide his attention between the pursuit
of Occultism and a wife. If he tries to, he will assuredly fail in
doing either properly; and, let me remind you, practical Occultism is
far too serious and dangerous a study for a man to take up, unless he
is in the most deadly earnest, and ready to sacrifice <i>all, himself
first of all</i>, to gain his end. But this does not apply to the members
of our Inner Section. I am only referring to those who are determined
to tread that path of discipleship which leads to the highest goal.
Most, if not all of those who join our Inner Section, are only
beginners, preparing themselves in this life to enter in reality upon
that path in lives to come.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_13_3"></a>THEOSOPHY AND EDUCATION.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> One of your strongest arguments for
the inadequacy of the existing forms of religion in the West, as also
to some extent the materialistic philosophy which is now so popular,
but which you seem to consider as an abomination of desolation, is
the large amount of misery and wretchedness which undeniably exists,
especially in our great cities. But surely you must recognize how much
has been, and is being done to remedy this state of things by the
spread of education and the diffusion of intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The future generations will hardly
thank you for such a “diffusion of intelligence,” nor will your present
education do much good to the poor starving masses.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Ah! but you must give us time. It is
only a few years since we began to educate the people.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And what, pray, has your
Christian religion been doing ever since the fifteenth century,
once you acknowledge that the education of the masses has not been
attempted till now—the very work, if ever there could be one, which a
<i>Christian</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, a Christ-following church and people,
ought to perform?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Well, you may be right; but now—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Just let us consider this question
of education from a broad standpoint, and I will prove to you that you
are doing harm not good, with many of your boasted improvements. The
schools for the poorer children, though far less useful than they ought
to be, are good in contrast with the vile surroundings to which they
are doomed by your modern Society. The <i>infusion</i> of a little practical
Theosophy would help a hundred times more in life the poor suffering
masses than all this infusion of (useless) intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But, really——</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Let me finish, please. You have
opened a subject on which we Theosophists feel deeply, and I must
have my say. I quite agree that there is a great advantage to a small
child bred in the slums, having the gutter for playground, and living
amid continued coarseness of gesture and word, in being placed daily
in a bright, clean school-room hung with pictures, and often gay with
flowers. There it is taught to be clean, gentle, orderly; there it
learns to sing and to play; has toys that awaken its intelligence;
learns to use its fingers deftly; is spoken to with a smile instead
of a frown; is gently rebuked or coaxed instead of cursed. All this
humanises the children, arouses their brains, and renders them
susceptible to intellectual and moral influences. The schools are not
all they might be and ought to be; but, compared with the homes, they
are paradises; and they slowly are reacting on the homes. But while
this is true of many of the Board schools, your system deserves the
worst one can say of it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> So be it; go on.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What is the <i>real</i> object of
modern education? Is it to cultivate and develop the mind in the right
direction; to teach the disinherited and hapless people to carry with
fortitude the burden of life (allotted them by Karma); to strengthen
their will; to inculcate in them the love of one’s neighbour and the
feeling of mutual interdependence and brotherhood; and thus to train
and form the character for practical life? Not a bit of it. And yet,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
these are undeniably the objects of all true education. No one denies
it; all your educationalists admit it, and talk very big indeed on the
subject. But what is the practical result of their action? Every young
man and boy, nay, every one of the younger generation of schoolmasters
will answer: “The object of modern education is to pass examinations,”
a system not to develop right emulation, but to generate and breed
jealousy, envy, hatred almost, in young people for one another, and
thus train them for a life of ferocious selfishness and struggle for
honours and emoluments instead of kindly feeling.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I must admit you are right there.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> And what are these examinations—the
terror of modern boyhood and youth? They are simply a method of
classification by which the results of your school teaching are
tabulated. In other words, they form the practical application of
the modern science methods to the <i>genus homo, qua</i> intellection.
Now “science” teaches that intellect is a result of the mechanical
interaction of the brain-stuff; therefore it is only logical that
modern education should be almost entirely mechanical—a sort of
automatic machine for the fabrication of intellect by the ton. Very
little experience of examinations is enough to show that the education
they produce is simply a training of the physical memory, and, sooner
or later, all your schools will sink to this level. As to any real,
sound cultivation of the thinking and reasoning power, it is simply
impossible while everything has to be judged by the results as tested
by competitive examinations. Again, school training is of the very
greatest importance in forming character, especially in its moral
bearing. Now, from first to last, your modern system is based on the
so-called scientific revelations: “The struggle for existence” and the
“survival of the fittest.” All through his early life, every man has
these driven into him by practical example and experience, as well
as by direct teaching, till it is impossible to eradicate from his
mind the idea that “self,” the lower, personal, animal self, is the
end-all, and be-all, of life. Here you get the great source of all the
after-misery, crime, and heartless selfishness, which you admit as much
as I do. Selfishness, as said over and over again, is the curse of
humanity, and the prolific parent of all the evils and crimes in this
life; and it is your schools which are the hotbeds of such selfishness.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> That is all very fine as
generalities, but I should like a few facts, and to learn also how this
can be remedied.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Very well, I will try and satisfy
you. There are three great divisions of scholastic establishments,
board, middle-class and public schools, running up the scale from
the most grossly commercial to the idealistic classical, with many
permutations and combinations. The practical commercial begets the
modern side, and the ancient and orthodox classical reflects its
heavy respectability even as far as the School Board pupil teacher’s
establishments. Here we plainly see the scientific and material
commercial supplanting the effete orthodox and classical. Neither is
the reason very far to seek. The objects of this branch of education
are, then, pounds, shillings, and pence, the <i>summum bonum</i> of the
XIXth century. Thus, the energies generated by the brain molecules of
its adherents are all concentrated on one point, and are, therefore, to
some extent, an organized army of <i>educated</i> and speculative intellects
of the minority of men, trained against the hosts of the ignorant,
simple-minded masses doomed to be vampirised, lived and sat upon by
their intellectually stronger brethren. Such training is not only
<i>untheosophical</i>, it is simply UNCHRISTIAN. Result: The direct outcome
of this branch of education is an overflooding of the market with
money-making machines, with heartless selfish men—animals—who have been
most carefully trained to prey on their fellows and take advantage of
the ignorance of their weaker brethren!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Well, but you cannot assert that of
our great public schools, at any rate?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not exactly, it is true. But
though the <i>form</i> is different, the animating spirit is the same:
<i>untheosophical</i> and <i>unchristian</i>, whether Eton and Harrow turn out
scientists or divines and theologians.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Surely you don’t mean to call Eton
and Harrow “commercial”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No. Of course the Classical system
is above all things <i>respectable</i>, and in the present day is productive
of some good. It does still remain the favourite at our great public
schools, where not only an intellectual, but also a social education
is obtainable. It is, therefore, of prime importance that the dull
boys of aristocratic and wealthy parents should go to such schools
to meet the rest of the young life of the “blood” and money classes.
But unfortunately there is a huge competition even for entrance; for
the moneyed classes are increasing, and poor but clever boys seek to
enter the public schools by the rich scholarships, both at the schools
themselves and from them to the Universities.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> According to this view, the
wealthier “dullards” have to work even harder than their poorer
fellows?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is so. But, strange to say,
the faithful of the cult of the “Survival of the fittest” do not
practice their creed; for their whole exertion is to make the naturally
unfit supplant the fit. Thus, by bribes of large sums of money, they
allure the best teachers from their natural pupils to mechanicalise
their naturally unfit progeny into professions which they uselessly
overcrowd.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And you attribute all this to
what?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> All this is owing to the
perniciousness of a system which turns out goods to order, irrespective
of the natural proclivities and talents of the youth. The poor little
candidate for this progressive paradise of learning, comes almost
straight from the nursery to the treadmill of a preparatory school for
sons of gentlemen. Here he is immediately seized upon by the workmen
of the materio-intellectual factory, and crammed with Latin, French
and Greek Accidence, Dates and Tables, so that if he have any natural
genius it is rapidly squeezed out of him by the rollers of what Carlyle
has so well-called “dead vocables.”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely he is taught something
besides “dead vocables,” and much of that which may lead him direct to
<i>Theosophy</i>, if not entirely into the Theosophical Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not much. For of history, he will
attain only sufficient knowledge of his own particular nation to fit
him with a steel armour of prejudice against all other peoples, and
be steeped in the foul cess-pools of chronicled national hate and
blood-thirstiness; and surely, you would not call that—<i>Theosophy</i>?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What are your further objections?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Added to this is a smattering
of selected, so-called, Biblical facts, from the study of which all
intellect is eliminated. It is simply a memory lesson, the “Why” of the
teacher being a “Why” of circumstances and not of reason.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yes; but I have heard you
congratulate yourself at the ever-increasing number of the Agnostics
and Atheists in our day, so that it appears that even people trained
in the system you abuse so heartily <i>do</i> learn to think and reason for
themselves.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Yes; but it is rather owing
to a healthy reaction from that system than due to it. We prefer
immeasurably more in our Society Agnostics, and even rank Atheists, to
bigots of whatever religion. An Agnostic’s mind is ever opened to the
truth; whereas the latter blinds the bigot like the sun does an owl.
The best—<i>i.e.</i>, the most truth-loving, philanthropic, and honest—of
our Fellows were, and are, Agnostics and Atheists (disbelievers in a
<i>personal</i> God). But there are no <i>free</i>-thinking boys and girls, and
generally early training will leave its mark behind in the shape of
a cramped and distorted mind. A proper and sane system of education
should produce the most vigorous and liberal mind, strictly trained
in logical and accurate thought, and not in blind faith. How can you
ever expect good results, while you pervert the reasoning faculty of
your children by bidding them believe in the miracles of the Bible on
Sunday, while for the six other days of the week you teach them that
such things are scientifically impossible?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> What would you have, then?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If we had money, we would found
schools which would turn out something else than reading and writing
candidates for starvation. Children should above all be taught
self-reliance, love for all men, altruism, mutual charity, and more
than anything else, to think and reason for themselves. We would reduce
the purely mechanical work of the memory to an absolute minimum, and
devote the time to the development and training of the inner senses,
faculties and latent capacities. We would endeavour to deal with each
child as a unit, and to educate it so as to produce the most harmonious
and equal unfoldment of its powers, in order that its special aptitudes
should find their full natural development. We should aim at creating
<i>free</i> men and women, free intellectually, free morally, unprejudiced
in all respects, and above all things, <i>unselfish</i>. And we believe
that much if not all of this could be obtained by <i>proper and truly
theosophical</i> education.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_13_4"></a>WHY, THEN, IS THERE SO MUCH PREJUDICE AGAINST THE T.S.?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> If Theosophy is even half of what
you say, why should there exist such a terrible ill-feeling against it?
This is even more of a problem than anything else.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is; but you must bear in mind
how many powerful adversaries we have aroused ever since the formation
of our Society. As I just said, if the Theosophical movement were one
of those numerous modern crazes, as harmless at the end as they are
evanescent, it would be simply laughed at—as it is now by those who
still do not understand its real purport—and left severely alone. But
it is nothing of the kind. Intrinsically, Theosophy is the most serious
movement of this age; and one, moreover, which threatens the very life
of most of the time-honoured humbugs, prejudices, and social evils of
the day—those evils which fatten and make happy the upper ten and their
imitators and sycophants, the wealthy dozens of the middle classes,
while they positively crush and starve out of existence the millions of
the poor. Think of this, and you will easily understand the reason of
such a relentless persecution by those others who, more observant and
perspicacious, do see the true nature of Theosophy, and therefore dread it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you mean to tell me that it is
because a few have understood what Theosophy leads to, that they try
to crush the movement? But if Theosophy leads only to good, surely you
cannot be prepared to utter such a terrible accusation of perfidious
heartlessness and treachery even against those few?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I am so prepared, on the contrary.
I do not call the enemies we have had to battle with during the first
nine or ten years of the Society’s existence either powerful or
“dangerous”; but only those who have arisen against us in the last
three or four years. And these neither speak, write nor preach against
Theosophy, but work in silence and behind the backs of the foolish
puppets who act as their visible <i>marionnettes</i>. Yet if <i>invisible</i> to
most of the members of our Society, they are well known to the true
“Founders” and the protectors of our Society. But they must remain for
certain reasons unnamed at present.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And are they known to many of you,
or to yourself alone?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I never said <i>I</i> knew them. I may
or may not know them—but I know <i>of them</i>, and this is sufficient; and
<i>I defy them to do their worst</i>. They may achieve great mischief and
throw confusion into our ranks, especially among the faint-hearted,
and those who can judge only by appearances. <i>They will not crush
the Society</i>, do what they may. Apart from these truly dangerous
enemies—“dangerous,” however, only to those Theosophists who are
unworthy of the name, and whose place is rather <i>outside</i> than <i>within</i>
the T.S.—the number of our opponents is more than considerable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Can you name these, at least, if you
will not speak of the others?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Of course I can. We have to contend
against (1) the hatred of the Spiritualists, American, English, and
French; (2) the constant opposition of the clergy of all denominations;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
(3) especially the relentless hatred and persecution of the
missionaries in India; (4) this led to the famous and infamous attack
on our Theosophical Society by the Society for Psychical Research, an
attack which was stirred up by a regular conspiracy organized by the
missionaries in India. Lastly, we must count the defection of various
prominent (?) members, for reasons I have already explained, all of
whom have contributed their utmost to increase the prejudice against us.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Cannot you give me more details
about these, so that I may know what to answer when asked—a brief
history of the Society, in short; and why the world believes all
this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The reason is simple. Most
outsiders knew absolutely nothing of the Society itself, its motives,
objects or beliefs. From its very beginning the world has seen in
Theosophy nothing but certain marvellous phenomena, in which two-thirds
of the non-spiritualists do not believe. Very soon the Society came
to be regarded as a body pretending to the possession of “miraculous”
powers. The world never realised that the Society taught absolute
disbelief in <i>miracle</i> or even the possibility of such; that in the
Society there were only a few people who possessed such psychic
powers and but few who cared for them. Nor did it understand that the
phenomena were never produced publicly, but only privately for friends,
and merely given as an accessory, to prove by direct demonstration that
such things could be produced without dark rooms, spirits, mediums,
or any of the usual paraphernalia. Unfortunately, this misconception
was greatly strengthened and exaggerated by the first book on the
subject which excited much attention in Europe—Mr. Sinnett’s “<i>Occult
World</i>.” If this work did much to bring the Society into prominence,
it attracted still more obloquy, derision and misrepresentation upon
the hapless heroes and heroine thereof. Of this the author was more
than warned in the <i>Occult World</i>, but did not pay attention to the
<i>prophecy</i>—for such it was, though half-veiled.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> For what, and since when, do the
Spiritualists hate you?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> From the first day of the
Society’s existence. No sooner the fact became known that, as a body,
the T.S. did not believe in communications with the spirits of the
dead, but regarded the so-called “spirits” as, for the most part,
astral reflections of disembodied personalities, shells, etc., than
the Spiritualists conceived a violent hatred to us and especially to
the Founders. This hatred found expression in every kind of slander,
uncharitable personal remarks, and absurd misrepresentations of the
Theosophical teachings in all the American Spiritualistic organs. For
years we were persecuted, denounced and abused. This began in 1875 and
continues to the present day. In 1879, the headquarters of the T.S.
were transferred from New York to Bombay, India, and then permanently
to Madras. When the first branch of our Society, the British T.S., was
founded in London, the English Spiritualists came out in arms against
us, as the Americans had done; and the French Spiritists followed
suit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why should the clergy be
hostile to you, when, after all, the main tendency of the Theosophical
doctrines is opposed to Materialism, the great enemy of all forms of
religion in our day? <span class="smcap"> Theo.</span> The Clergy
opposed us on the general principle that “He who is not with me is
against me.” Since Theosophy does not agree with any one Sect or Creed,
it is considered the enemy of all alike, because it teaches that they
are all, more or less, mistaken. The missionaries in India hated and
tried to crush us because they saw the flower of the educated Indian
youth and the Brahmins, who are almost inaccessible to them, joining
the Society in large numbers. And yet, apart from this general class
hatred, the T.S. counts in its ranks many clergymen, and even one or
two bishops.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And what led the S.P.R. to take the
field against you? You were both pursuing the same line of study, in
some respects, and several of the Psychic Researchers belonged to your society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> First of all we were very good
friends with the leaders of the S.P.R.; but when the attack on the
phenomena appeared in the <i>Christian College Magazine</i>, supported by
the pretended revelations of a menial, the S.P.R. found that they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
had compromised themselves by publishing in their “Proceedings” too
many of the phenomena which had occurred in connection with the
T.S. Their ambition is to pose as an <i>authoritative</i> and <i>strictly
scientific</i> body; so that they had to choose between retaining that
position by throwing overboard the T.S. and even trying to destroy it,
and seeing themselves merged, in the opinion of the Sadducees of the
<i>grand monde</i>, with the “credulous” Theosophists and Spiritualists.
There was no way for them out of it, no two choices, and they chose to
throw us overboard. It was a matter of dire necessity for them. But so
hard pressed were they to find any apparently reasonable motive for
the life of devotion and ceaseless labour led by the two Founders, and
for the complete absence of any pecuniary profit or other advantage to
them, that our enemies were obliged to resort to the thrice-absurd,
eminently ridiculous, and now famous “Russian spy theory,” to explain
this devotion. But the old saying, “The blood of the martyr is the
seed of the Church,” proved once more correct. After the first shock
of this attack, the T.S. doubled and tripled its numbers, but the bad
impression produced still remains. A French author was right in saying,
“<i>Calomniez, calomniez toujours et encore, il en restera toujours
quelque chose.</i>” Therefore it is, that unjust prejudices are current,
and that everything connected with the T.S., and especially with its
Founders, is so falsely distorted, because based on malicious hearsay alone.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet in the 14 years during which the
Society has existed, you must have had ample time and opportunity to
show yourselves and your work in their true light?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> How, or when, have we been given
such an opportunity? Our most prominent members had an aversion to
anything that looked like publicly justifying themselves. Their policy
has ever been: “We must live it down”; and “What does it matter what
the newspapers say, or people think?” The Society was too poor to send
out public lecturers, and therefore the expositions of our views and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
doctrines were confined to a few Theosophical works that met with
success, but which people often misunderstood, or only knew of through
hearsay. Our journals were, and still are, boycotted; our literary
works ignored; and to this day no one seems even to feel quite certain
whether the Theosophists are a kind of Serpent-and-Devil worshippers,
or simply “Esoteric Buddhists”—whatever that may mean. It was useless
for us to go on denying, day after day and year after year, every kind
of inconceivable cock-and-bull stories about us; for, no sooner was
one disposed of, than another, a still more absurd and malicious one,
was born out of the ashes of the first. Unfortunately, human nature is
so constituted that any good said of a person is immediately forgotten
and never repeated. But one has only to utter a calumny, or to start a
story—no matter how absurd, false or incredible it may be, if only it
is connected with some unpopular character—for it to be successful and
forthwith accepted as a historical fact. Like <i>Don Basilio’s</i>
“<span class="smcap">Calumnia</span>,” the rumour springs up, at first,
as a soft gentle breeze hardly stirring the grass under your feet, and
arising no one knows whence; then, in the shortest space of time, it is
transformed into a strong wind, begins to blow a gale, and forthwith
becomes a roaring storm! A calumny among news, is what an octopus is
among fishes; it sucks into one’s mind, fastens upon our memory, which
feeds upon it, leaving indelible marks even after the calumny has been
bodily destroyed. A calumnious lie is the only master-key that will
open any and every brain. It is sure to receive welcome and hospitality
in every human mind, the highest as the lowest, if only a little prejudiced,
and no matter from however base a quarter and motive it has started.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Don’t you think your assertion
altogether too sweeping? The Englishman has never been over-ready to
believe in anything said, and our nation is proverbially known for its
love of fair play. A lie has no legs to stand upon for long, and—</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The Englishman is as ready to
believe evil as a man of any other nation; for it is human nature, and
not a national feature. As to lies, if they have no legs to stand upon,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
according to the proverb, they have exceedingly rapid wings; and
they can and do fly farther and wider than any other kind of news,
in England as elsewhere. Remember lies and calumny are the only
kind of literature we can always get gratis, and without paying any
subscription. We can make the experiment if you like. Will you, who are
so interested in Theosophical matters, and have heard so much about us,
will you put me questions on as many of these rumours and “hearsays”
as you can think of? I will answer you the truth, and nothing but the
truth, subject to the strictest verification.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Before we change the subject, let us
have the whole truth on this one. Now, some writers have called your
teachings “immoral and pernicious”; others, on the ground that many
so-called “authorities” and Orientalists find in the Indian religions
nothing but sex-worship in its many forms, accuse you of teaching
nothing better than Phallic worship. They say that since modern
Theosophy is so closely allied with Eastern, and particularly Indian,
thought, it cannot be free from this taint. Occasionally, even, they
go so far as to accuse European Theosophists of reviving the practices
connected with this cult. How about this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I have heard and read about this
before, and I answer that no more utterly baseless and lying calumny
has ever been invented and circulated. “Silly people can see but silly
dreams,” says a Russian proverb. It makes one’s blood boil to hear such
vile accusations made without the slightest foundation, and on the
strength of mere inferences. Ask the hundreds of honourable English men
and women who have been members of the Theosophical Society for years
whether an <i>immoral</i> precept or a <i>pernicious</i> doctrine was ever taught
to them. Open the <i>Secret Doctrine</i>, and you will find page after page
denouncing the Jews and other nations precisely on account of this
devotion to Phallic rites, due to the dead letter interpretation of
nature symbolism, and the grossly materialistic conceptions of her
dualism in all the <i>exoteric</i> creeds. Such ceaseless and malicious
misrepresentation of our teachings and beliefs is really disgraceful.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But you cannot deny that the Phallic
element <i>does</i> exist in the religions of the East?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Nor do I deny it; only I maintain
that this proves no more than does its presence in Christianity, the
religion of the West. Read Hargrave Jenning’s <i>Rosicrucians</i>, if you
would assure yourself of it. In the East, the Phallic symbolism is,
perhaps, more crude, because more true to nature, or I would rather
say, more <i>naïve</i> and sincere than in the West. But it is not more
licentious, nor does it suggest to the Oriental mind the same gross and
coarse ideas as to the Western, with, perhaps, one or two exceptions,
such as the shameful sect known as the “Maharajah,” or <i>Vallabhachârya</i>
sect.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> A writer in the <i>Agnostic</i>
journal—one of your accusers—has just hinted that the followers of
this disgraceful sect are Theosophists, and “claim true Theosophic
insight.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> He wrote a falsehood, and
that’s all. There never was, nor is there at present, one single
Vallabhachârya in our Society. As to their having, or claiming
Theosophic insight, that is another fib, based on crass ignorance about
the Indian Sects. Their “Maharajah” only claims a right to the money,
wives and daughters of his foolish followers and no more. This sect is
despised by all the other Hindus.</p>
<p class="indent">But you will find the whole subject dealt with at
length in the <i>Secret Doctrine</i>, to which I must again refer you for
detailed explanations. To conclude, the very soul of Theosophy is
dead against Phallic worship; and its occult or esoteric section more
so even than the exoteric teachings. There never was a more lying
statement made than the above. And now ask me some other questions.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_13_5"></a>IS THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY A<br> MONEY-MAKING CONCERN?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Agreed. Well, have either of the
Founders, Colonel H. S. Olcott or H. P. Blavatsky, ever made any money,
profit, or derived any worldly benefit from the T.S., as some papers
say?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not one penny. The papers lie. On
the contrary, they have both given all they had, and literally beggared
themselves. As for “worldly benefits,” think of the calumnies and
vilification they have been subjected to, and then ask the question!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet I have read in a good many
missionary organs that the entrance fees and subscriptions much more
than covered all expenses; and one said that the Founders were making
twenty thousand pounds a year!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> This is a fib, like many others.
In the published accounts of January, 1889, you will find an exact
statement of <i>all</i> the money ever received from any source since
1879. The total received from all sources (entrance fees, donations,
etc., etc.) during these ten years is under six thousand pounds, and
of this a large part was contributed by the Founders themselves from
the proceeds of their private resources and their literary work. All
this has been openly and officially admitted, even by our enemies, the
Psychic Research Society. And now both the Founders are penniless; one,
too old and ill to work as she did before, unable to spare time for
outside literary work to help the Society in money, can only write for
the Theosophical cause; the other keeps labouring for it as before, and
receives as little thanks for it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely they need money to
live?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not at all. So long as they have
food and lodging, even though they owe it to the devotion of a few
friends, they need little more.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But could not Madame Blavatsky,
especially, make more than enough to live upon by her writings?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> When in India she received on the
average some thousand rupees a year for articles contributed to Russian
and other papers, but gave it all away to the Society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Political articles?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Never. Everything she has written
throughout the seven years of her stay in India is all there in print.
It deals only with the religions, ethnology, and customs of India,
and with Theosophy—never with politics, of which she knows nothing
and cares less. Again, two years ago she refused several contracts
amounting together to about 1,200 roubles in gold per month; for she
could not accept them without abandoning her work for the Society,
which needed all her time and strength. She has documents to prove it.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But why could not both she and
Colonel Olcott do as others—notably many Theosophists—do; follow out
their respective professions and devote the surplus of their time to
the work of the Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because by serving two masters,
either the professional or the philanthropic work would have had to
suffer. Every true Theosophist is morally bound to sacrifice the
personal to the impersonal, his own <i>present</i> good to the <i>future</i>
benefit of other people. If the Founders do not set the example, who
will?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And are there many who follow it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I am bound to answer you the truth.
In Europe about half-a-dozen in all, out of more than that number of
Branches.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then it is not true that the
Theosophical Society has a large capital or endowment of its own?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is false, for it has none at
all. Now that the entrance fee of £1 and the small annual due have been
abolished, it is even a doubtful question whether the staff at the
headquarters in India will not soon be starved to death.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then why not raise subscriptions?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We are not the Salvation Army; we
<i>cannot</i> and <i>have never</i> begged; nor have we ever followed the example
of the Churches and sects and “taken up collections.” That which is
occasionally sent for the support of the Society, the small sums
contributed by some devoted Fellows, are all voluntary donations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But I have heard of large sums of
money given to Mdme. Blavatsky. It was said four years ago that she
got £5,000 from one rich, young “Fellow,” who went out to join them
in India and £10,000 from another wealthy and well-known American
gentleman, one of your members who died in Europe four years ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Say to those who told you this,
that they either themselves utter, or repeat, a gross falsehood.
<i>Never has</i> “Madame Blavatsky” <i>asked or received</i> ONE PENNY from the
two above-named gentlemen, nor anything like that from anyone else,
since the Theosophical Society was founded. Let any man living try to
substantiate this calumny, and it will be easier for him to prove that
the Bank of England is a bankrupt than that the said “Founder” has ever
made any money out of Theosophy. These two calumnies have been started
by two high-born ladies, belonging to the London aristocracy, and have
been immediately traced and disproved. They are the dead bodies, the
carcases of two inventions, which, after having been buried in the sea
of oblivion, are once more raised on the surface of the stagnant waters
of slander.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then I have been told of several
large <i>legacies</i> left to the T.S. One—some £8,000—was left to it by
some eccentric Englishman, who did not even belong to the Society. The
other—£3,000 or £4,000—were testated by an Australian F.T.S. Is this
true?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I heard of the first; and I also
know that, whether legally left or not, the T.S. has never profited by
it, nor have the Founders ever been officially notified of it. For,
as our Society was not then a chartered body, and thus had no legal
existence, the Judge at the Court of Probate, as we were told, paid
no attention to such legacy and turned over the sum to the heirs. So
much for the first. As for the second, it is quite true. The testator
was one of our devoted Fellows, and willed all he had to the T.S. But
when the President, Colonel Olcott, came to look into the matter, he
found that the testator had children whom he had disinherited for some
family reasons. Therefore, he called a council, and it was decided
that the legacy should be refused, and the moneys passed to the legal
heirs. The Theosophical Society would be untrue to its name were it to
profit by money to which others are entitled virtually, at any rate on
Theosophical principles, if not legally.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Again, and I say this on the
authority of your own Journal, the <i>Theosophist</i>, there’s a Rajah of
India who donated to the Society 25,000 rupees. Have you not thanked
him for his great bounty in the January <i>Theosophist</i> for 1888?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We have, in these words, “That the
thanks of the Convention be conveyed to H. H. the Maharajah ... for his
<i>promised munificent gift</i> of Rupees 25,000 to the Society’s Fund.” The
thanks were duly conveyed, but the money is still a “promise,” and has
never reached the Headquarters.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But surely, if the Maharajah
promised and received thanks for his gift publicly and in print, he
will be as good as his promise?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> He may, though the promise is 18
months old. I speak of the present and not of the future.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then how do you propose to go on?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> So long as the T.S. has a few
devoted members willing to work for it without reward and thanks, so
long as a few good Theosophists support it with occasional donations,
so long will it exist, and nothing can crush it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I have heard many Theosophists speak
of a “power behind the Society” and of certain “Mahatmas,” mentioned
also in Mr. Sinnett’s works, that are said to have founded the Society,
to watch over and protect it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> You may laugh, but it is so.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_13_6"></a>THE WORKING STAFF OF THE T.S.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> These men, I have heard, are great
Adepts, Alchemists, and what not. If, then, they can change lead into
gold and make as much money as they like, besides doing all kinds of
miracles at will, as related in Mr. Sinnett’s “Occult World,” why do
not they find you money, and support the Founders and the Society in
comfort?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because they did not found a
“miracle club.” Because the Society is intended to help men to develop
the powers latent in them through their own exertions and merit.
Because whatever they may or may not produce in the way of phenomena,
they are not <i>false coiners</i>; nor would they throw an additional
and very strong temptation on the path of members and candidates:
<i>Theosophy is not to be bought</i>. Hitherto, for the past 14 years, not a
single working member has ever received pay or salary from either the
Masters or the Society.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then are none of your workers paid
at all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Till now, not one. But as every
one has to eat, drink, and clothe himself, all those who are without
any means of their own, and devote their whole time to the work of the
society, are provided with the necessaries of life at the Headquarters
at Madras, India, though these “necessaries” are humble enough, in
truth! (See Rules at the end.) But now that the Society’s work has
increased so greatly and still goes on in increasing (N.B., <i>owing to
slanders</i>) in Europe, we need more working hands. We hope to have a
few members who will henceforth be remunerated—if the word <i>can</i> be
used in the cases in question. For every one of these Fellows, who are
preparing to give <i>all</i> their time to the Society, are quitting good
official situations with excellent prospects, to work for us at <i>less
than half their former salary</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And who will provide the funds for
this?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Some of our Fellows who are just a
little richer than the rest. The man who would speculate or make money
on Theosophy would be unworthy to remain in our ranks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But you must surely make money by
your books, magazines, and other publications?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The <i>Theosophist</i> of Madras, alone
among the magazines, pays a profit, and this has regularly been turned
over to the Society, year by year, as the published accounts show.
<i>Lucifer</i> is slowly but steadily ingulfing money, never yet having paid
expenses—thanks to its being boycotted by the pious booksellers and
railway stalls. The <i>Lotus</i>, in France—started on the private and not
very large means of a Theosophist, who has devoted to it his whole time
and labour—has ceased to exist, owing to the same causes, alas! Nor
does the New York <i>Path</i> pay its way, while the <i>Revue Théosophique</i>
of Paris has only just been started, also from the private means of
a lady-member. Moreover, whenever any of the works issued by the
Theosophical Publishing Company in London do pay, the proceeds will
be devoted to the service of the Society.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And now please tell me all you can
about the Mahatmas. So many absurd and contradictory things are said
about them, that one does not know what to believe, and all sorts of
ridiculous stories become current.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Well may you call them “ridiculous!”

<h2>XIV. <br>THE “THEOSOPHICAL MAHATMAS.”</h2></div>
<h3>ARE THEY “SPIRITS OF LIGHT” OR “GOBLINS DAMN’D”?</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Who are they, finally, those whom
you call your “Masters”? Some say they are “Spirits,” or some other
kind of supernatural beings, while others call them “myths.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They are neither. I once heard
one outsider say to another that they were a sort of <i>male mermaids</i>,
whatever such a creature may be. But if you listen to what people say,
you will never have a true conception of them. In the first place they
are <i>living men</i>, born as we are born, and doomed to die like every
other mortal.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yes, but it is rumoured that some of
them are a thousand years old. Is this true?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> As true as the miraculous growth of
hair on the head of Meredith’s Shagpat. Truly, like the “Identical,”
no Theosophical shaving has hitherto been able to crop it. The more we
deny them, the more we try to set people right, the more absurd do the
inventions become. I have heard of Methuselah being 969 years old; but,
not being forced to believe in it, have laughed at the statement, for
which I was forthwith regarded by many as a blasphemous heretic.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Seriously, though, do they outlive
the ordinary age of men?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What do you call the ordinary age?
I remember reading in the <i>Lancet</i> of a Mexican who was almost 190
years old; but I have never heard of mortal man, layman, or Adept, who
could live even half the years allotted to Methuselah. Some Adepts do
exceed, by a good deal, what you would call the ordinary age; yet there
is nothing miraculous in it, and very few of them care to live very long.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what does the word “Mahatma”
really mean?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply a “great soul,” great
through moral elevation and intellectual attainment. If the title of
great is given to a drunken soldier like Alexander, why should we not
call those “Great” who have achieved far greater conquests in Nature’s
secrets, than Alexander ever did on the field of battle? Besides, the
term is an Indian and a very old word.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And why do you call them
“Masters”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We call them “Masters” because
they are our teachers; and because from them we have derived all
the Theosophical truths, however inadequately some of us may have
expressed, and others understood, them. They are men of great learning,
whom we term Initiates, and still greater holiness of life. They are
not ascetics in the ordinary sense, though they certainly remain apart
from the turmoil and strife of your western world.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But is it not selfish thus to
isolate themselves?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Where is the selfishness? Does not
the fate of the Theosophical Society sufficiently prove that the world
is neither ready to recognise them nor to profit by their teaching? Of
what use would Professor Clerk Maxwell have been to instruct a class
of little boys in their multiplication-table? Besides, they isolate
themselves only from the West. In their own country they go about as
publicly as other people do.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Don’t you ascribe to them
supernatural powers?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We believe in nothing supernatural,
as I have told you already. Had Edison lived and invented his
phonograph two hundred years ago, he would most probably have been
burnt along with it, and the whole attributed to the devil. The powers
which they exercise are simply the development of potencies lying
latent in every man and woman, and the existence of which even official
science begins to recognise.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Is it true that these men <i>inspire</i>
some of your writers, and that many, if not all, of your Theosophical
works were written under their dictation?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Some have. There are passages
entirely dictated by them and <i>verbatim</i>, but in most cases they only
inspire the ideas and leave the literary form to the writers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this in itself is miraculous;
is, in fact, a <i>miracle</i>. How can they do it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> My dear Sir, you are labouring
under a great mistake, and it is science itself that will refute
your arguments at no distant day. Why should it be a “miracle,” as
you call it? A miracle is supposed to mean some operation which
is supernatural, whereas there is really nothing above or beyond
<span class="smcap">Nature</span> and Nature’s laws. Among the many
forms of the “miracle” which have come under modern scientific
recognition, there is Hypnotism, and one phase of its power is known
as “Suggestion,” a form of thought transference, which has been
successfully used in combating particular physical diseases, etc. The
time is not far distant when the World of Science will be forced to
acknowledge that there exists as much interaction between one mind and
another, no matter at what distance, as between one body and another
in closest contact. When two minds are sympathetically related, and
the instruments through which they function are tuned to respond
magnetically and electrically to one another, there is nothing which
will prevent the transmission of thoughts from one to the other, at
will; for since the mind is not of a tangible nature, that distance
can divide it from the subject of its contemplation, it follows that
the only difference that can exist between two minds is a difference
of <span class="smcap">STATE</span>. So if this latter hindrance is
overcome, where is the “miracle” of <i>thought transference</i>, at whatever
distance?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But you will admit that Hypnotism
does nothing so miraculous or wonderful as that?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> On the contrary, it is a
well-established fact that a Hypnotist can affect the brain of his
subject so far as to produce an expression of his own thoughts, and
even his words, through the organism of his subject; and although the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
phenomena attaching to this method of actual thought transference are
as yet few in number, no one, I presume, will undertake to say how
far their action may extend in the future, when the laws that govern
their production are more scientifically established. And so, if such
results can be produced by the knowledge of the mere rudiments of
Hypnotism, what can prevent the Adept in Psychic and Spiritual powers
from producing results which, with your present limited knowledge of
their laws, you are inclined to call “miraculous”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then why do not our physicians
experiment and try if they could not do as much?<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56_56">[56]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Because, first of all, they are
not Adepts with a thorough understanding of the secrets and laws of
psychic and spiritual realms, but materialists, afraid to step outside
the narrow groove of matter; and, secondly, because they <i>must fail</i>
at present, and indeed until they are brought to acknowledge that such
powers are attainable.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> And could they be taught?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Not unless they were first of all
prepared, by having the materialistic dross they have accumulated in
their brains swept away to the very last atom.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This is very interesting. Tell
me, have the Adepts thus inspired or dictated to many of your Theosophists?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> No, on the contrary, to very few.
Such operations require special conditions. An unscrupulous but skilled
Adept of the Black Brotherhood (“Brothers of the Shadow,” and Dugpas,
we call them) has far less difficulties to labour under. For, having
no laws of the Spiritual kind to trammel his actions, such a Dugpa
“sorcerer” will most unceremoniously obtain control over any mind, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
subject it entirely to his evil powers. But our Masters will never
do that. They have no right, except by falling into Black Magic, to
obtain full mastery over anyone’s immortal Ego, and can therefore
act only on the physical and psychic nature of the subject, leaving
thereby the free will of the latter wholly undisturbed. Hence, unless
a person has been brought into psychic relationship with the Masters,
and is assisted by virtue of his full faith in, and devotion to, his
Teachers, the latter, whenever transmitting their thoughts to one with
whom these conditions are not fulfilled, experience great difficulties
in penetrating into the cloudy chaos of that person’s sphere. But this
is no place to treat of a subject of this nature. Suffice it to say,
that if the power exists, then there are Intelligences (embodied or
disembodied) which guide this power, and living conscious instruments
through whom it is transmitted and by whom it is received. We have only
to beware of <i>black</i> magic.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But what do you really mean by
“black magic”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Simply <i>abuse of psychic powers</i>,
or of any <i>secret of nature</i>; the fact of applying to selfish and
sinful ends the powers of Occultism. A hypnotiser, who, taking
advantage of his powers of “suggestion,” forces a subject to steal
or murder, would be called a <i>black magician</i> by us. The famous
“rejuvenating system” of Dr. Brown-Sequard, of Paris, through a
loathsome <i>animal injection</i> into human blood—a discovery all the
medical papers of Europe are now discussing—if true, is <i>unconscious
black magic</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But this is mediæval belief in witchcraft
and sorcery! Even Law itself has ceased to believe in such things?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> So much the worse for law, as it
has been led, through such a lack of discrimination, into committing
more than one judiciary mistake and crime. It is the term alone that
frightens you with its “superstitious” ring in it. Would not law
punish an abuse of hypnotic powers, as I just mentioned? Nay, it has
so punished it already in France and Germany; yet it would indignantly
deny that it applied punishment to a crime of evident <i>sorcery</i>.
You cannot believe in the efficacy and reality of the <i>powers of suggestion</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
by physicians and mesmerisers (or hypnotisers), and then refuse to
believe in the same powers when used for evil motives. And if you
do, then you believe in <i>Sorcery</i>. Yon cannot believe in good and
disbelieve in evil, accept genuine money and refuse to credit such a
thing as false coin. Nothing can exist without its contrast, and no
day, no light, no good could have any representation as such in your
consciousness, were there no night, darkness nor evil to offset and
contrast them.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Indeed, I have known men, who, while
thoroughly believing in that which you call great psychic, or magic
powers, laughed at the very mention of Witchcraft and Sorcery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What does it prove? Simply that
they are illogical. So much the worse for them, again. And we,
knowing as we do of the existence of good and holy Adepts, believe as
thoroughly in the existence of bad and unholy Adepts, or—Dugpas.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if the Masters exist, why don’t
they come out before all men and refute once for all the many charges
which are made against Mdme. Blavatsky and the Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> What charges?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> That <i>they</i> do not exist, and that
she has invented them. That they are men of straw, “Mahatmas of muslin
and bladders.” Does not all this injure her reputation?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> In what way can such an accusation
injure her in reality? Did she ever make money on their presumed
existence, or derive benefit, or fame, therefrom? I answer that she has
gained only insults, abuse, and calumnies, which would have been very
painful had she not learned long ago to remain perfectly indifferent
to such false charges. For what does it amount to, after all? Why,
to an <i>implied compliment</i>, which, if the fools, her accusers, were
not carried away by their blind hatred, they would have thought twice
before uttering. To say that she has invented the Masters comes to
this: She must have invented every bit of philosophy that has ever been
given out in Theosophical literature. She must be the author of the
letters from which “Esoteric Buddhism” was written; the sole inventor
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
of every tenet found in the “Secret Doctrine,” which, if the world were
just, would be recognised as supplying many of the missing links of
science, as will be discovered a hundred years hence. By saying what
they do, they are also giving her the credit of being far cleverer than
the hundreds of men, (many <i>very</i> clever and not a few scientific men,)
who believe in what she says—inasmuch as she must have fooled them all!
If they speak the truth, then she must be several Mahatmas rolled into
one like a nest of Chinese boxes; since among the so-called “Mahatma
letters” are many in totally different and distinct styles, all of
which her accusers declare that she has written.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> It is just what they say. But is
it not very painful to her to be publicly denounced as “the most
accomplished impostor of the age, whose name deserves to pass to
posterity,” as is done in the Report of the “Society for Psychical Research”?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It might be painful if it were
true, or came from people less rabidly materialistic and prejudiced. As
it is, personally she treats the whole matter with contempt, while the
Mahatmas simply laugh at it. In truth, it is the greatest compliment
that could be paid to her. I say so, again.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But her enemies claim to have proved
their case.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Aye, it is easy enough to make such
a claim when you have constituted yourself judge, jury, and prosecuting
counsel at once, as they did. But who, except their direct followers
and our enemies, believe in it?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But they sent a representative to
India to investigate the matter, didn’t they?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> They did, and their final
conclusion rests entirely on the unchecked statements and unverified
assertions of this young gentleman. A lawyer who read through his
report told a friend of mine that in all his experience he had never
seen “such a <i>ridiculous</i> and self-condemnatory document.” It was found
to be full of suppositions and “<i>working</i> hypotheses” which mutually
destroy each other. Is this a serious charge?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Yet it has done the Society great
harm. Why, then, did she not vindicate her own character, at least,
before a Court of Law?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Firstly, because as a Theosophist,
it is her duty to leave unheeded all personal insults. Secondly,
because neither the Society nor Mdme. Blavatsky had any money to waste
over such a law-suit. And lastly, because it would have been ridiculous
for both to be untrue to their principles, because of an attack made on
them by a flock of stupid old British wethers, who had been led to butt
at them by an over frolicksome lambkin from Australia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> This is complimentary. But do you
not think that it would have done real good to the cause of Theosophy,
if she had authoritatively disproved the whole thing once for all?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Perhaps. But do you believe that
any English jury or judge would have ever admitted the reality of
psychic phenomena, even if entirely unprejudiced beforehand? And when
you remember that they would have been set against us already by the
“Russian Spy” scare, the charge of <i>Atheism and infidelity</i>, and all
the other calumnies that have been circulated against us, you cannot
fail to see that such an attempt to obtain justice in a Court of Law
would have been worse than fruitless! All this the Psychic Researchers
knew well, and they took a base and mean advantage of their position to
raise themselves above our heads and save themselves at our expense.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> The S.P.R. now denies completely the
existence of the Mahatmas. They say that from beginning to end they
were a romance which Madame Blavatsky has woven from her own brain?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Well, she might have done many
things less clever than this. At any rate, we have not the slightest
objection to this theory. As she always says now, she almost prefers
that people should not believe in the Masters. She declares openly
that she would rather people should seriously think that the only
Mahatmaland is the grey matter of her brain, and that, in short, she
has evolved them out of the depths of her own inner consciousness, than
that their names and grand ideal should be so infamously desecrated as
they are at present. At first she used to protest indignantly against
any doubts as to their existence. Now she never goes out of her way to
prove or disprove it. Let people think what they like.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But, of course, these Masters <i>do</i>
exist?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We affirm <i>they do</i>. Nevertheless,
this does not help much. Many people, even some Theosophists
and ex-Theosophists, say that they have never had any proof of
their existence. Very well; then Mme. Blavatsky replies with this
alternative:—If she has invented them, then she has also invented their
philosophy and the practical knowledge which some few have acquired;
and if so, what does it matter whether they do exist or not, since
she herself is here, and <i>her own existence</i>, at any rate, can hardly
be denied? If the knowledge supposed to have been imparted by them is
good intrinsically, and it is accepted as such by many persons of more
than average intelligence, why should there be such a <i>hullabaloo</i> made
over that question? The fact of her being an impostor <i>has never been
proved</i>, and will always remain <i>sub judice</i>; whereas it is a certain
and undeniable fact that, by whomsoever invented, the philosophy
preached by the “Masters” is one of the grandest and most beneficent
philosophies once it is properly understood. Thus the slanderers, while
moved by the lowest and meanest feelings—those of hatred, revenge,
malice, wounded vanity, or disappointed ambition,—seem quite unaware
that they are paying the greatest tribute to her intellectual powers.
So be it, if the poor fools will have it so. Really, Mme. Blavatsky has
not the slightest objection to being represented by her enemies as a
<i>triple</i> Adept, and a “Mahatma” to boot. It is only her unwillingness
to pose in her own sight as a crow parading in peacock’s feathers that
compels her to this day to insist upon the truth.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if you have such wise and good
men to guide the Society, how is it that so many mistakes have been
made?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> The Masters do <i>not</i> guide the
Society, not even the Founders; and no one has ever asserted that they
did: they only watch over and protect it. This is amply proved by the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
fact that no mistakes have been able to cripple it, and no scandals
from within, nor the most damaging attacks from without, have been able
to overthrow it. The Masters look at the future, not at the present,
and every mistake is so much more accumulated wisdom for days to come.
That other “Master” who sent the man with the five talents did not
tell him how to double them, nor did he prevent the foolish servant
from burying his one talent in the earth. Each must acquire wisdom by
his own experience and merits. The Christian Churches, who claim a far
higher “Master,” the very Holy Ghost itself, have ever been and are
still guilty not only of “mistakes,” but of a series of bloody crimes
throughout the ages. Yet, no Christian would deny, for all that, his
belief in <i>that</i> “Master,” I suppose? although his existence is far
more <i>hypothetical</i> than that of the Mahatmas; as no one has ever seen
the Holy Ghost, and <i>his</i> guidance of the Church, moreover, their own
ecclesiastical history distinctly contradicts. <i>Errare humanum est.</i>
Let us return to our subject.</p>
<h3><a id="SECTION_14_2"></a>THE ABUSE OF SACRED NAMES AND TERMS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Then, what I have heard, namely,
that many of your Theosophical writers claim to have been inspired by
these Masters, or to have seen and conversed with them, is not true?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It may or it may not be true.
How can I tell? The burden of proof rests with them. Some of them, a
few—very few, indeed—have distinctly either <i>lied</i> or were hallucinated
when boasting of such inspiration; others were truly inspired by great
Adepts. The tree is known by its fruits; and as all Theosophists have
to be judged by their deeds and not by what they write or say, so <i>all</i>
Theosophical books must be accepted on their merits, and not according
to any claim to authority which they may put forward.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But would Mdme. Blavatsky apply this
to her own works—the <i>Secret Doctrine</i>, for instance?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Certainly; she says expressly in
the PREFACE that she gives out the doctrines that she has learnt from
the Masters, but claims no inspiration whatever for what she has
lately written. As for our best Theosophists, they would also in this
case far rather that the names of the Masters had never been mixed up
with our books in any way. With few exceptions, most of such works are
not only imperfect, but positively erroneous and misleading. Great
are the desecrations to which the names of two of the Masters have
been subjected. There is hardly a medium who has not claimed to have
seen them. Every bogus swindling Society, for commercial purposes,
now claims to be guided and directed by “Masters,” often supposed to
be far higher than ours! Many and heavy are the sins of those who
advanced these claims, prompted either by desire for lucre, vanity, or
irresponsible mediumship. Many persons have been plundered of their
money by such societies, which offer to sell the secrets of power,
knowledge, and spiritual truth for worthless gold. Worst of all, the
sacred names of Occultism and the holy keepers thereof have been
dragged in this filthy mire, polluted by being associated with sordid
motives and immoral practices, while thousands of men have been held
back from the path of truth and light through the discredit and evil
report which such shams, swindles, and frauds have brought upon the
whole subject. I say again, every earnest Theosophist regrets to-day,
from the bottom of his heart, that these sacred names and things have
ever been mentioned before the public, and fervently wishes that they
had been kept secret within a small circle of trusted and devoted friends.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> The names certainly do occur very
frequently now-a-days, and I never remember hearing of such persons as
“Masters” till quite recently.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> It is so; and had we acted on
the wise principle of silence, instead of rushing into notoriety and
publishing all we knew and heard, such desecration would never have
occurred. Behold, only fourteen years ago, before the Theosophical
Society was founded, all the talk was of “Spirits.” They were
everywhere, in everyone’s mouth; and no one by any chance even
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
dreamt of talking about living “Adepts,” “Mahatmas,” or “Masters.” One
hardly heard even the name of the Rosicrucians, while the existence
of such a thing as “Occultism” was suspected even but by very few.
Now all that is changed. We Theosophists were, unfortunately, the
first to talk of these things, to make the fact of the existence in
the East of “Adepts” and “Masters” and Occult knowledge known; and
now the name has become common property. It is on us, now, that the
Karma, the consequences of the resulting desecration of holy names and
things, has fallen. All that you now find about such matters in current
literature—and there is not a little of it—all is to be traced back to
the impulse given in this direction by the Theosophical Society and
its Founders. Our enemies profit to this day by our mistake. The most
recent book directed against our teachings is alleged to have been
written <i>by an Adept of twenty years’ standing</i>. Now, it is a <i>palpable
lie</i>. We know the amanuensis and his <i>inspirers</i> (as he is himself too
ignorant to have written anything of the sort). These “inspirers” are
living persons, revengeful and unscrupulous in proportion to their
intellectual powers; and these <i>bogus</i> Adepts are not one, but several.
The cycle of “Adepts,” used as sledge-hammers to break the theosophical
heads with, began twelve years ago, with Mrs. Emma Hardinge Britten’s
“Louis” of <i>Art Magic</i> and <i>Ghost-Land</i>, and now ends with the “Adept”
and “Author” of <i>The Light of Egypt</i>, a work written by Spiritualists
against Theosophy and its teachings. But it is useless to grieve over
what is done, and we can only suffer in the hope that our indiscretions
may have made it a little easier for others to find the way to these
Masters, whose names are now everywhere taken in vain, and under cover
of which so many iniquities have already been perpetrated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Do you reject “Louis” as an Adept?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> We denounce no one, leaving this
noble task to our enemies. The spiritualistic author of <i>Art Magic</i>,
etc., may or may not have been acquainted with such an Adept—and
saying this, I say far less than what that lady has said and written
about us and Theosophy for the last several years—that is her own
business. Only when, in a solemn scene of mystic vision, an alleged
“Adept” sees “spirits” presumably at Greenwich, England, through
Lord Rosse’s telescope, which was built in, and never moved from,
Parsonstown, Ireland,<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57_57">[57]</a>
I may well be permitted to wonder at the ignorance of that “Adept” in
matters of science. This beats all the mistakes and blunders committed
at times by the <i>chelas</i> of our Teachers! And it is this “Adept” that
is used now to break the teachings of our Masters!</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I quite understand your feeling in
this matter, and think it only natural. And now, in view of all that
you have said and explained to me, there is one subject on which I
should like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If I can answer them I will. What is that?
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>
<hr class="chap">
<div class="chapter"><a id="SECTION_15_1"></a>
<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2></div>
<h3>THE FUTURE OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Tell me, what do you expect for
Theosophy in the future?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If you speak of <span class="smcap">Theosophy</span>, I answer that, as it has existed
eternally throughout the endless cycles upon cycles of the Past, so
it will ever exist throughout the infinitudes of the Future, because
Theosophy is synonymous with EVERLASTING TRUTH.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> Pardon me; I meant to ask you rather
about the prospects of the Theosophical Society.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Its future will depend almost
entirely upon the degree of selflessness, earnestness, devotion, and
last, but not least, on the amount of knowledge and wisdom possessed by
those members on whom it will fall to carry on the work, and to direct
the Society after the death of the Founders.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> I quite see the importance of
their being selfless and devoted, but I do not quite grasp how their
<i>knowledge</i> can be as vital a factor in the question as these other
qualities. Surely the literature which already exists, and to which
constant additions are still being made, ought to be sufficient?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> I do not refer to technical
knowledge of the esoteric doctrine, though that is most important; I
spoke rather of the great need which our successors in the guidance
of the Society will have of unbiased and clear judgment. Every such
attempt as the Theosophical Society has hitherto ended in failure,
because, sooner or later, it has degenerated into a sect, set up
hard-and-fast dogmas of its own, and so lost by imperceptible degrees
that vitality which living truth alone can impart. You must remember
that all our members have been bred and born in some creed or religion,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
that all are more or less of their generation both physically and
mentally, and consequently that their judgment is but too likely to be
warped and unconsciously biased by some or all of these influences. If,
then, they cannot be freed from such inherent bias, or at least taught
to recognise it instantly and so avoid being led away by it, the result
can only be that the Society will drift off on to some sandbank of
thought or another, and there remain a stranded carcass to moulder and die.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But if this danger be averted?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Then the Society will live on
into and through the twentieth century. It will gradually leaven and
permeate the great mass of thinking and intelligent people with its
large-minded and noble ideas of Religion, Duty, and Philanthropy.
Slowly but surely it will burst asunder the iron fetters of creeds
and dogmas, of social and caste prejudices; it will break down racial
and national antipathies and barriers, and will open the way to the
practical realisation of the Brotherhood of all men. Through its
teaching, through the philosophy which it has rendered accessible and
intelligible to the modern mind, the West will learn to understand and
appreciate the East at its true value. Further, the development of
the psychic powers and faculties, the premonitory symptoms of which
are already visible in America, will proceed healthily and normally.
Mankind will be saved from the terrible dangers, both mental and
bodily, which are inevitable when that unfolding takes place, as it
threatens to do, in a hot-bed of selfishness and all evil passions.
Man’s mental and psychic growth will proceed in harmony with his moral
improvement, while his material surroundings will reflect the peace and
fraternal goodwill which will reign in his mind, instead of the discord
and strife which is everywhere apparent around us to-day.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> A truly delightful picture! But
tell me, do you really expect all this to be accomplished in one short
century?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> Scarcely. But I must tell you that
during the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by
those “Masters,” of whom I have spoken, to help on the spiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
progress of Humanity in a marked and definite way. Towards the close of
each century you will invariably find that an outpouring or upheaval of
spirituality—or call it mysticism if you prefer—has taken place. Some
one or more persons have appeared in the world as their agents, and a
greater or less amount of occult knowledge and teaching has been given
out. If you care to do so, you can trace these movements back, century
by century, as far as our detailed historical records extend.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Enq.</span> But how does this bear on the future
of the Theosophical Society?</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Theo.</span> If the present attempt, in the
form of our Society, succeeds better than its predecessors have done,
then it will be in existence as an organized, living and healthy body
when the time comes for the effort of the XXth century. The general
condition of men’s minds and hearts will have been improved and
purified by the spread of its teachings, and, as I have said, their
prejudices and dogmatic illusions will have been, to some extent
at least, removed. Not only so, but besides a large and accessible
literature ready to men’s hands, the next impulse will find a numerous
and <i>united</i> body of people ready to welcome the new torch-bearer
of Truth. He will find the minds of men prepared for his message, a
language ready for him in which to clothe the new truths he brings,
an organization awaiting his arrival, which will remove the merely
mechanical, material obstacles and difficulties from his path. Think
how much one, to whom such an opportunity is given, could accomplish.
Measure it by comparison with what the Theosophical Society actually
<i>has</i> achieved in the last fourteen years, without <i>any</i> of these
advantages and surrounded by hosts of hindrances which would not hamper
the new leader. Consider all this, and then tell me whether I am too
sanguine when I say that if the Theosophical Society survives and lives
true to its mission, to its original impulses through the next hundred
years—tell me, I say, if I go too far in asserting that earth will be
a heaven in the twenty-first century in comparison with what it is now!</p>

<p class="f120"><b>DECLARATION</b></p>
<p class="indent">The policy of this Lodge is independent devotion
to the cause of Theosophy, without professing attachment to any
Theosophical organization. It is loyal to the great Founders of the
Theosophical Movement, but does not concern itself with dissensions or
differences of individual opinion.</p>
<p class="indent">The work it has on hand and the end it keeps in view
are too absorbing and too lofty to leave it the time or inclination to
take part in side issues. That work and that end is the dissemination
of the Fundamental Principles of the philosophy of Theosophy, and
the exemplification in practice of those principles, through a truer
realization of the <span class="smcap">Self</span>; a profounder
conviction of Universal Brotherhood.</p>
<p class="indent">It holds that the unassailable <i>Basis for Union</i>
among Theosophists, wherever and however situated, is “<i>similarity of
aim, purpose and teaching</i>,” and therefore has neither Constitution,
By-laws nor Officers, the sole bond between its Associates being that
<i>basis</i>. And it aims to disseminate this idea among Theosophists in the
furtherance of Unity.</p>
<p class="indent">It regards as Theosophists all who are engaged in
the true service of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex,
condition or organization, and</p>
<p class="indent">It welcomes to its association all those who are in
accord with its declared purposes and who desire to fit themselves, by

<p class="drop-cap no-indent">THEOSOPHY is a Monthly Magazine
devoted to the promulgation of Theosophy as it was given by those who
brought it. Established in 1912 by the United Lodge of Theosophists,
the magazine is now in the front rank of Theosophical publications
and its circulation extends to every civilized country. The first
eight volumes of the magazine contain reprints of the numerous
original articles written by H. P. Blavatsky and William Q. Judge in
explanation, exemplification and application of the philosophy recorded
in their published books. These precious articles, replete with Occult
instruction, were first published in <i>The Theosophist</i>, <i>Lucifer</i>, and
<i>The Path</i>, now for many years out of print, so that their surpassing
value was lost and inaccessible to Students of the present generation.
<span class="smcap">Theosophy</span> has made them once more
available. In addition to these reprints the magazine contains many
original articles written by Robert Crosbie and other devoted Pupils
and Students of the Messengers of the Theosophical Movement of the
nineteenth century. Not the least of the contents of the magazine are
the Studies of the Teachings, the historical articles relating to the
Theosophical Movement, the Parent Theosophical Society, and the many
allied and related organizations and societies of the present day. The
entire contents of the magazine are universal in scope and application,
unbiased in treatment, and free from sectarian or partisan influence.
In order to preserve at all times the impersonality of its tone, and
that readers may form their judgment from the inherent value perceived
in the articles and not from the names signed to them, the Editors and
Contributors remain anonymous, no living person’s name being mentioned
in connection with the authorship of any article published.</p>

<p class="drop-cap no-indent">PARENTS and others interested in the
Spiritual and Moral welfare of Children and averse to the sectarian
dogmas and false ideas prevalent under the name of religious teachings,
have long felt the necessity for literature which should impart true
fundamental conceptions of Nature, of Life and of Duty to the growing
generation. As a portion of its Fraternal activities the United
Lodge of Theosophists has long maintained a <i>Children’s School of
Theosophy</i>. To this School come children of all ages, Theosophists and
Non-Theosophists as to Parentage. They are taught the primary truths
common to all religions and philosophies, dealing with Birth, Life,
Death, Law, Action, and Duty. The Eternal Verities thus inculcated
make for clean, sturdy, wholesome physical, mental, as well as moral
and spiritual happiness and well-being. The experience thus gained in
actual practice has been embodied in two books, wherein the lessons
and instructions found helpful and formative to the highest character
are plainly and clearly outlined, with all necessary suggestions and
directions to enable Parents, Teachers and others to fit themselves to
be the better able to help and guide the plastic minds of the Children
to true perceptions of Life and Action.</p>

 Also called Analogeticists. As explained by Prof. Alex.
Wilder, F.T.S., in his “Eclectic Philosophy,” they were called so
because of their practice of interpreting all sacred legends and
narratives, myths and mysteries, by a rule or principle of analogy
and correspondence: so that events which were related as having
occurred in the external world were regarded as expressing operations
and experiences of the human soul. They were also denominated
Neo-Platonists. Though Theosophy, or the Eclectic Theosophical system,
is generally attributed to the third century, yet, if Diogenes Laertius
is to be credited, its origin is much earlier, as he attributed the
system to an Egyptian priest, Pot-Amun, who lived in the early days
of the Ptolemaic dynasty. The same author tells us that the name is
Coptic, and signifies one consecrated to Amun, the God of Wisdom.
Theosophy is the equivalent of Brahma-Vidya, divine knowledge.</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
Eclectic Theosophy was divided under three heads: (1)
Belief in one absolute, incomprehensible and supreme Deity, or infinite
essence, which is the root of all nature, and of all that is, visible
and invisible. (2) Belief in man’s eternal immortal nature, because,
being a radiation of the Universal Soul, it is of an identical essence
with it. (3) <i>Theurgy</i>, or “divine work,” or <i>producing a work of
gods</i>; from <i>theoi</i>, “gods,” and <i>ergein</i>, “to work.” The term
is very old, but, as it belongs to the vocabulary of the MYSTERIES,
was not in popular use. It was a mystic belief—practically proven
by initiated adepts and priests—that, by making oneself as pure
as the incorporeal beings—<i>i.e.</i>, by returning to one’s pristine
purity of nature—man could move the gods to impart to him Divine
mysteries, and even cause them to become occasionally visible, either
subjectively or objectively. It was the transcendental aspect of what
is now called Spiritualism; but having been abused and misconceived
by the populace, it had come to be regarded by some as necromancy,
and was generally forbidden. A travestied practice of the theurgy
of Iamblichus lingers still in the ceremonial magic of some modern
Kabalists. Modern Theosophy avoids and rejects both these kinds of
magic and “necromancy” as being very dangerous. Real <i>divine</i> theurgy
requires an almost superhuman purity and holiness of life; otherwise
it degenerates into mediumship or black magic. The immediate disciples
of Ammonius Saccas, who was called <i>Theodidaktos</i>, “god-taught”—such
as Plotinus and his follower Porphyry—rejected theurgy at first, but
were finally reconciled to it through Iamblichus, who wrote a work
to that effect entitled “De Mysteriis,” under the name of his own
master, a famous Egyptian priest called Abammon. Ammonius Saccas was
the son of Christian parents, and, having been repelled by dogmatic
spiritualistic Christianity from his childhood, became a Neo-Platonist,
and like J. Boehme and other great seers and mystics, is said to
have had divine wisdom revealed to him in dreams and visions. Hence
his name of <i>Theodidaktos</i>. He resolved to reconcile every system of
religion, and by demonstrating their identical origin to establish
one universal creed based on ethics. His life was so blameless
and pure, his learning so profound and vast, that several Church
Fathers were his secret disciples. Clemens Alexandrinus speaks very
highly of him. Plotinus, the “St. John” of Ammonius, was also a man
universally respected and esteemed, and of the most profound learning
and integrity. When thirty-nine years of age he accompanied the Roman
Emperor Gordian and his army to the East, to be instructed by the
sages of Bactria and India. He had a School of Philosophy in Rome.
Porphyry, his disciple, whose real name was Malek (a Hellenized Jew),
collected all the writings of his master. Porphyry was himself a great
author, and gave an allegorical interpretation to some parts of Homer’s
writings. The system of meditation the Philaletheians resorted to was
ecstacy, a system akin to Indian Yoga practice. What is known of the
Eclectic School is due to Origen, Longinus, and Plotinus, the immediate
disciples of Ammonius.—(<i>Vide Eclectic Philos.</i>, by A. Wilder).</p></div>

It was under Philadelphus that Judaism established itself in
Alexandria, and forthwith the Hellenic teachers became the dangerous
rivals of the College of Rabbis of Babylon. As the author of “Eclectic
Philosophy” very pertinently remarks: “The Buddhistic, Vedantic, and
Magian systems were expounded along with the philosophies of Greece at
that period. It was not wonderful that thoughtful men supposed that
the strife of words ought to cease, and considered it possible to
extract one harmonious system from these various teachings.... Panænus,
Athenagoras, and Clement were thoroughly instructed in Platonic
philosophy, and comprehended its essential unity with the Oriental
systems.”</p></div>
<div class="footnote"><p class="no-indent">
<a id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4" class="pginternal"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
Says Mosheim of Ammonius: “Conceiving that not only the philosophers
of Greece, but also all those of the different barbarian nations, were
perfectly in unison with each other with regard to every essential
point, he made it his business so to expound the thousand tenets of
all these various sects as to show they had all originated from one
and the same source, and tended all to one and the same end.” If the
writer on Ammonius in the <i>Edinburgh Encyclopædia</i> knows what he
is talking about, then he describes the modern Theosophists, their
beliefs, and their work, for he says, speaking of the <i>Theodidaktos</i>:
“He adopted the doctrines which were received in Egypt (the esoteric
were those of India) concerning the Universe and the Deity, considered
as constituting one great whole; concerning the eternity of the world
... and established a system of moral discipline which allowed the
people in general to live according to the laws of their country and
the dictates of nature, but required the wise to exalt their mind by
contemplation.”</p></div>

This is what the scholarly author of “The Eclectic Philosophy,” Prof.
A. Wilder, F.T.S., describes as “<i>spiritual photography</i>”: “The soul
is the camera in which facts and events, future, past, and present,
are alike fixed; and the mind becomes conscious of them. Beyond our
every-day world of limits all is one day or state—the past and future
comprised in the present.” ... “Death is the last <i>ecstasis</i> on earth.
Then the soul is freed from the constraint of the body, and its nobler
part is united to higher nature and becomes partaker in the wisdom
and foreknowledge of the higher beings.” Real Theosophy is, for the
mystics, that state which Apollonius of Tyana was made to describe
thus: “I can see the present and the future as in a clear mirror. The
sage need not wait for the vapours of the earth and the corruption of
the air to foresee events.... The <i>theoi</i>, or gods, see the future;
common men the present; sages that which is about to take place.”
“The Theosophy of the Sages” he speaks of is well expressed in the
assertion, “The Kingdom of God is within us.”</p></div>

An “attached member” means one who has joined some
particular branch of the T.S. An “unattached,” one who belongs to
the Society at large, has his diploma, from the Headquarters (Adyar,
Madras), but is connected with no branch or lodge.</p></div>

We say that in such cases it is not the <i>spirits</i> of the dead who
<i>descend</i> on earth, but the spirits of the living that <i>ascend</i> to
the pure Spiritual Souls. In truth there is neither <i>ascending</i> nor
<i>descending</i>, but a change of <i>state</i> or <i>condition</i> for the medium.
The body of the latter becoming paralyzed, or “entranced,” the
spiritual Ego is free from its trammels, and finds itself on the same
plane of consciousness with the disembodied spirits. Hence, if there
is any spiritual attraction between the two <i>they can communicate</i>,
as often occurs in dreams. The difference between a mediumistic and
a non-sensitive nature is this: the liberated spirit of a medium has
the opportunity and facility of influencing the passive organs of its
entranced physical body, to make them act, speak, and write at its
will. The Ego can make it repeat, echo-like, and in the human language,
the thoughts and ideas of the disembodied entity, as well as its own.
But the <i>non-receptive</i> or non-sensitive organism of one who is very
positive cannot be so influenced. Hence, although there is hardly a
human being whose Ego does not hold free intercourse, during the sleep
of his body, with those whom it loved and lost, yet, on account of the
positiveness and non-receptivity of its physical envelope and brain,
no recollection, or a very dim, dream-like remembrance, lingers in the
memory of the person once awake.</p></div>

It has become “fashionable,” especially of late, to deride the notion
that there ever was, in the <i>mysteries</i> of great and civilized peoples,
such as the Egyptians, Greeks, or Romans, anything but priestly
imposture. Even the Rosicrucians were no better than half lunatics,
half knaves. Numerous books have been written on them; and tyros, who
had hardly heard the name a few years before, sallied out as profound
critics and Gnostics on the subject of alchemy, the fire-philosophers,
and mysticism in general. Yet a long series of the Hierophants of
Egypt, India, Chaldea, and Arabia are known, along with the greatest
philosophers and sages of Greece and the West, to have included
under the designation of wisdom and divine science all knowledge,
for they considered the base and origin of every art and science as
<i>essentially</i> divine. Plato regarded the <i>mysteries</i> as most sacred,
and Clemens Alexandrinus, who had been himself initiated into the
Eleusinian mysteries, has declared “that the doctrines taught therein
contained in them the end of all human knowledge.” Were Plato and
Clemens two knaves or two fools, we wonder, or—both?</p></div>

Publicans—regarded as so many thieves and pickpockets in those
days. Among the Jews the name and profession of a publican was the
most odious thing in the world. They were not allowed to enter the
Temple, and Matthew (xviii. 17) speaks of a heathen and a publican
as identical. Yet they were only Roman tax-gatherers occupying the
same position as the British officials in India and other conquered
countries.</p></div>

“At the close of the Middle Ages slavery, under the power of moral
forces, had mainly disappeared from Europe; but two momentous events
occurred which overbore the moral power working in European society
and let loose a swarm of curses upon the earth such as mankind had
scarcely ever known. One of these events was the first voyaging to
a populated and barbarous coast where human beings were a familiar
article of traffic; and the other the discovery of a new world, where
mines of glittering wealth were open, provided labour could be imported
to work them. For four hundred years men and women and children were
torn from all whom they knew and loved, and were sold on the coast of
Africa to foreign traders; they were chained below decks—the dead often
with the living—during the horrible ‘middle passage,’ and, according to
Bancroft, an impartial historian, two hundred and fifty thousand out
of three and a quarter millions were thrown into the sea on that fatal
passage, while the remainder were consigned to nameless misery in the
mines, or under the lash in the cane and rice fields. The guilt of this
great crime rests on the Christian Church. ‘In the name of the most
Holy Trinity’ the Spanish Government (Roman Catholic) concluded more
than ten treaties authorising the sale of five hundred thousand human
beings; in 1562 Sir John Hawkins sailed on his diabolical errand of
buying slaves in Africa and selling them in the West Indies in a ship
which bore the sacred name of Jesus; while Elizabeth, the Protestant
Queen, rewarded him for his success in this first adventure of
Englishmen in that inhuman traffic by allowing him to wear as his crest
‘a demi-Moor in his proper colour, bound with a cord, or, in other
words, a manacled negro slave.’”—<i>Conquests of the Cross</i> (quoted from
the <i>Agnostic Journal</i>).</p></div>

How can the non-active eternal principle emanate or emit?
The Parabrahm of the Vedantins does nothing of the kind; nor does the
Ain-Soph of the Chaldean Kabala. It is an eternal and periodical law
which causes an active and creative force (the logos) to emanate from
the ever-concealed and incomprehensible one principle at the beginning
of every maha-manvantara, or new cycle of life.</p></div>

One often finds in Theosophical writings
conflicting statements about the Christos principle in man. Some call
it the sixth principle (<i>Buddhi</i>), others the seventh (<i>Atman</i>). If
Christian Theosophists wish to make use of such expressions, let them
be made philosophically correct by following the analogy of the old
Wisdom-Religion symbols. We say that Christos is not only one of the
three higher principles, but all the three regarded as a Trinity.
This Trinity represents the Holy Ghost, the Father, and the Son, as
it answers to abstract spirit, differentiated spirit, and embodied
spirit. Krishna and Christ are philosophically the same principle
under its triple aspect of manifestation. In the <i>Bhagavatgita</i> we
find Krishna calling himself indifferently Atman, the abstract Spirit,
Kshetragna, the Higher or reincarnating Ego, and the Universal <span class="smcap">Self</span>, all names which, when transferred from the
Universe to man, answer to <i>Atma</i>, <i>Buddhi</i> and <i>Manas</i>. The <i>Anugita</i>
is full of the same doctrine.</p></div>

Buddha gives to Ananda, his <i>initiated</i> disciple, who enquires for the
reason of this silence, a plain and unequivocal answer in the dialogue
translated by Oldenburg from the <i>Samyuttaka Nikaya</i>:—“If I, Ananda,
when the wandering monk Vacchagotta asked me: ‘Is there the Ego?’ had
answered ‘The Ego is,’ then that, Ananda, would have confirmed the
doctrine of the Samanas and Brahmanas, who believed in permanence. If
I, Ananda, when the wandering monk Vacchagotta asked me, ‘Is there not
the Ego?’ had answered, ‘The Ego is not,’ then that, Ananda, would
have confirmed the doctrine of those who believed in annihilation. If
I, Ananda, when the wandering monk Vacchagotta asked me, ‘Is there
the Ego?’ had answered, ‘The Ego is,’ would that have served my end,
Ananda, by producing in him the knowledge: all existences (dhamma)
are non-ego? But if I, Ananda, had answered, ‘The Ego is not,’ then
that, Ananda, would only have caused the wandering monk Vacchagotta
to be thrown from one bewilderment to another: ‘My Ego, did it not
exist before? But now it exists no longer!’” This shows, better than
anything, that Gautama Buddha withheld such difficult metaphysical
doctrines from the masses in order not to perplex them more. What
he meant was the difference between the personal temporary Ego and
the Higher Self, which sheds its light on the imperishable Ego, the
spiritual “I” of man.</p></div>

In Mr. Sinnett’s “Esoteric Buddhism” <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and <i>f</i>, are
respectively called the Animal, the Human, and the Spiritual Souls,
which answers as well. Though the principles in <i>Esoteric Buddhism</i> are
numbered, this is, strictly speaking, useless. The dual <i>Monad</i> alone
(<i>Atma-Buddhi</i>) is susceptible of being thought of as the two highest
numbers (the 6th and 7th). As to all others, since <i>that</i> “principle”
only which is predominant in man has to be considered as the first and
foremost, no numeration is possible as a general rule. In some men it
is the higher Intelligence (Manas or the 5th) which dominates the rest;
in others the Animal Soul (Kama-rupa) that reigns supreme, exhibiting
the most bestial instincts, etc.</p></div>

Paul calls Plato’s <i>Nous</i> “Spirit”; but as this spirit is “substance,”
then, of course, <i>Buddhi</i> and not <i>Atma</i> is meant, as the latter
cannot philosophically be called “substance” under any circumstance.
We include Atma among the human “principles” in order not to create
additional confusion. In reality it is no “human” but the universal
<i>absolute</i> principle of which Buddhi, the Soul-Spirit, is the carrier.</p></div>

“Plato and Pythagoras,” says Plutarch, “distribute the
soul into two parts, the rational (noetic) and irrational (agnoia);
that that part of the soul of man which is rational is eternal; for
though it be not God, yet it is the product of an eternal deity, but
that part of the soul which is divested of reason (agnoia) dies.” The
modern term <i>Agnostic</i> comes from <i>Agnosis</i>, a cognate word. We wonder
why Mr. Huxley, the author of the word, should have connected his great
intellect with “the soul divested of reason” which dies? Is it the
exaggerated humility of the modern materialist?</p></div>

Proserpina, or Persephone, stands here for post mortem Karma, which
is said to regulate the separation of the lower from the higher
“principles”: the <i>Soul</i>, as <i>Nephesh</i>, the breath of animal life,
which remains for a time in Kama-loka, from the higher compound <i>Ego</i>,
which goes into the state of Devachan, or bliss.</p></div>

“The phantasy,” says Olympiodorus (in Platonis Phæd.) “is an impediment
to our intellectual conceptions; and hence, when we are agitated by the
inspiring influence of the Divinity, if the phantasy intervenes, the
enthusiastic energy ceases: for enthusiasm and the ecstasy are contrary
to each other. Should it be asked whether the soul is able to energise
without the phantasy, we reply, that its perception of universals
proves that it is able. It has perceptions, therefore, independent of
the phantasy; at the same time, however, the phantasy attends in its
energies, just as a storm pursues him who sails on the sea.”</p></div>

Namely, the body, life, passional and animal instincts,

There are five <i>Skandhas</i> or attributes in the Buddhist teachings:
“<i>Rupa</i> (form or body), material qualities; <i>Vedana</i>, sensation;
<i>Sanna</i>, abstract ideas; <i>Samkhara</i>, tendencies of mind; <i>Vinnana</i>,
mental powers. Of these we are formed; by them we are conscious of
existence; and through them communicate with the world about us.”</p></div>

The accuracy of the teaching is sanctioned by the Rev. H. Sumangala,
High Priest of the Sripada and Galle, and Principal of the <i>Widyodaya
Parivena</i> (College) at Colombo, as being in agreement with the Canon of
the Southern Buddhist Church.</p></div>

Or the <i>Spiritual</i>, in contradistinction to the personal <i>Self</i>. The
student must not confuse this Spiritual Ego with the “HIGHER SELF”

Spirit.</p></div>

Even in his <i>Buddhist Cathechism</i>, Col. Olcott, forced to it by the
logic of Esoteric philosophy, found himself obliged to correct the
mistakes of previous Orientalists who made no such distinction, and
gives the reader his reason for it. Thus he says: “The successive
appearances upon the earth, or ‘descents into generation,’ of the
<i>tanhaically</i> coherent parts (Skandhas) of a certain being are a
succession of personalities. In each birth the PERSONALITY differs
from that of a previous or next succeeding birth. Karma, the DEUS
EX MACHINA, masks (or shall we say reflects?) itself now in the
personality of a sage, again as an artisan, and so on throughout the
string of births. But though personalities ever shift, the one line of
life along which they are strung, like beads, runs unbroken; it is ever
that <i>particular line</i>, never any other. It is therefore individual, an
individual vital undulation, which began in Nirvana, or the subjective
side of nature, as the light or heat undulation through æther began
at its dynamic source; is careering through the objective side of
nature under the impulse of Karma and the creative direction of <i>Tanha</i>
(the unsatisfied desire for existence); and leads through many cyclic
changes back to Nirvana. Mr. Rhys-Davids calls that which passes from
personality to personality along the individual chain ‘character,’ or
‘doing.’ Since ‘character’ is not a mere metaphysical abstraction, but
the sum of one’s mental qualities and moral propensities, would it not
help to dispel what Mr. Rhys-Davids calls ‘the desperate expedient of
a mystery’ (<i>Buddhism</i>, p. 101) if we regarded the life-undulation as
individuality, and each of its series of natal manifestations as a
separate personality? The perfect individual, Buddhistically speaking,
is a Buddha, I should say; for Buddha is but the rare flower of
humanity, without the least supernatural admixture. And as countless
generations (‘four <i>asankheyyas</i> and a hundred thousand cycles,’
Fausboll and Rhys-Davids’ BUDDHIST BIRTH STORIES, p. 13) are required
to develop a <i>man</i> into a Buddha, and <i>the iron will to become one</i>
runs throughout all the successive births, what shall we call that
which thus wills and perseveres? Character? One’s individuality:
an individuality but partly manifested in any one birth, but built
up of fragments from all the births?” (<i>Bud. Cat., Appendix</i>
A. 137.)</p></div>

<span class="smcap">Mahat</span> or the “Universal Mind” is the source
of Manas. The latter is Mahat, <i>i.e.</i>, mind, in man. Manas is also
called <i>Kshetrajna</i>, “embodied Spirit,” because it is, according to
our philosophy, the <i>Manasa-putras</i>, or “Sons of the Universal Mind,”
who <i>created</i>, or rather produced, the <i>thinking</i> man, “<i>manu</i>,” by
incarnating in the <i>third Race</i> mankind in our Round. It is Manas,
therefore, which is the real incarnating and permanent <i>Spiritual Ego</i>,
the INDIVIDUALITY, and our various and numberless personalities only
its external masks.</p></div>

It is on this transgression that the cruel and illogical
dogma of the Fallen Angels has been built. It is explained in Vol. II.
of the <i>Secret Doctrine</i>. All our “Egos” are thinking and rational
entities (<i>Manasa-putras</i>) who had lived, whether under human or
other forms, in the precedent <i>life-cycle</i> (Manvantara), and whose
Karma it was to incarnate in the <i>man</i> of this one. It was taught in
the <span class="smcap">Mysteries</span> that, having delayed to comply with this law
(or having “refused to create” as Hinduism says of the <i>Kumaras</i> and
Christian legend of the Archangel Michael), <i>i.e.</i>, having failed to
incarnate in due time, the bodies predestined for them got defiled
(Vide Stanzas VIII. and IX. in the “Slokas of Dzyan,” Vol. II. Secret
Doctrine, pp. 19 and 20), hence the original sin of the senseless forms
and the punishment of the <i>Egos</i>. That which is meant by the rebellious
angels being hurled down into Hell is simply explained by these pure
Spirits or Egos being imprisoned in bodies of unclean matter, flesh.</p></div>

<i>Taijasi</i> means the radiant in consequence of its union with Buddhi;
<i>i.e.</i>, Manas, the human soul, illuminated by the radiance of the
divine soul. Therefore, Manas-taijasi may be described as radiant
mind; the <i>human</i> reason lit by the light of the spirit; and

Some Theosophists have taken exception to this phrase, but the words
are those of Master, and the meaning attached to the word “unmerited”
is that given above. In the T.P.S. pamphlet No. 6, a phrase, criticised
subsequently in <span class="smcap">Lucifer</span>, was used which was
intended to convey the same idea. In form, however, it was awkward and
open to the criticism directed against it; but the essential idea was
that men often suffer from the effects of the actions done by others,
effects which thus do not strictly belong to their own Karma—and for
these sufferings they of course deserve compensation.</p></div>

The length of this “transfer” depends, however, on the degree of
spirituality in the ex-personality of the disembodied Ego. For those
whose lives were very spiritual this transfer, though gradual, is

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
