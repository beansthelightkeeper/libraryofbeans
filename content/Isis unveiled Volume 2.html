<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Were</span> it possible, we would keep this work out of the hands of
many Christians whom its perusal would not benefit, and for
whom it was not written. We allude to those whose faith in their respective
churches is pure and sincere, and those whose sinless lives reflect the
glorious example of that Prophet of Nazareth, by whose mouth the spirit
of truth spake loudly to humanity. Such there have been at all times.
History preserves the names of many as heroes, philosophers, philanthropists,
martyrs, and holy men and women; but how many more have
lived and died, unknown but to their intimate acquaintance, unblessed
but by their humble beneficiaries! These have ennobled Christianity,
but would have shed the same lustre upon any other faith they might have
professed—for they were higher than their creed. The benevolence of
Peter Cooper and Elizabeth Thompson, of America, who are not orthodox
Christians, is no less Christ-like than that of the Baroness Angela
Burdett-Coutts, of England, who is one. And yet, in comparison with
the millions who have been accounted Christians, such have always
formed a small minority. They are to be found at this day, in pulpit
and pew, in palace and cottage; but the increasing materialism,
worldliness and hypocrisy are fast diminishing their proportionate number.
Their charity, and simple, child-like faith in the infallibility of their
Bible, their dogmas, and their clergy, bring into full activity all the virtues

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
that are implanted in our common nature. We have personally known
such God-fearing priests and clergymen, and we have always avoided
debate with them, lest we might be guilty of the cruelty of hurting their
feelings; nor would we rob a single layman of his blind confidence, if it
alone made possible for him holy living and serene dying.</p>

<p>An analysis of religious beliefs in general, this volume is in particular
directed against theological Christianity, the chief opponent of free
thought. It contains not one word against the pure teachings of Jesus,
but unsparingly denounces their debasement into pernicious ecclesiastical
systems that are ruinous to man’s faith in his immortality and his
God, and subversive of all moral restraint.</p>

<p>We cast our gauntlet at the dogmatic theologians who would enslave
both history and science; and especially at the Vatican, whose despotic
pretensions have become hateful to the greater portion of enlightened
Christendom. The clergy apart, none but the logician, the investigator,
the dauntless explorer should meddle with books like this. Such delvers

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> the United States of America, sixty thousand (60,428) men are paid
salaries to teach the Science of God and His relations to His creatures.</p>

<p>These men contract to impart to us the knowledge which treats of
the existence, character, and attributes of our Creator; His laws and
government; the doctrines we are to believe and the duties we are to
practice. Five thousand (5,141) of
 <span class="lock">them,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a></span>
 with the prospect of 1273
theological students to help them in time, teach this science according
to a formula prescribed by the Bishop of Rome, to five million people.
Fifty-five thousand (55,287) local and travelling ministers, representing
fifteen different
 <span class="lock"> denominations,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2">[2]</a></span>
 each contradicting the other upon more
or less vital theological questions, instruct, in their respective doctrines,
thirty-three million (33,500,000) other persons. Many of these teach according
to the canons of the cis-Atlantic branch of an establishment
which acknowledges a daughter of the late Duke of Kent as its spiritual

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
head. There are many hundred thousand Jews; some thousands of
Orientals of all kinds; and a very few who belong to the Greek Church.
A man at Salt Lake City, with nineteen wives and more than one hundred
children and grandchildren, is the supreme spiritual ruler over
ninety thousand people, who believe that he is in frequent intercourse
with the gods—for the Mormons are Polytheists as well as Polygamists,
and their chief god is represented as living in a planet they call Colob.</p>

<p>The God of the Unitarians is a bachelor; the Deity of the Presbyterians,
Methodists, Congregationalists, and the other orthodox Protestant
sects a spouseless Father with one Son, who is identical with Himself.
In the attempt to outvie each other in the erection of their sixty-two
thousand and odd churches, prayer-houses, and meeting-halls, in which
to teach these conflicting theological doctrines, $354,485,581 have been
spent. The value of the Protestant parsonages alone, in which are
sheltered the disputants and their families, is roughly calculated to
approximate $54,115,297. Sixteen million (16,179,387) dollars, are,
morever, contributed every year for current expenses of the Protestant
denominations only. One Presbyterian church in New York cost a round
million; a Catholic altar alone, one-fourth as much!</p>

<p>We will not mention the multitude of smaller sects, communities, and
extravagantly original little heresies in this country which spring up one
year to die out the next, like so many spores of fungi after a rainy day.
We will not even stop to consider the alleged millions of Spiritualists;
for the majority lack the courage to break away from their respective religious
denominations. These are the back-door Nicodemuses.</p>

<p>And now, with Pilate, let us inquire, What is truth? Where is it to be
searched for amid this multitude of warring sects? Each claims to be
based upon divine revelation, and each to have the keys of the celestial
gates. Is either in possession of this rare truth? Or, must we exclaim
with the Buddhist philosopher, “There is but one truth on earth, and it
is unchangeable: and this is—that there is <em>no</em> truth on it!”</p>

<p>Though we have no disposition whatever to trench upon the ground
that has been so exhaustively gleaned by those learned scholars who have
shown that every Christian dogma has its origin in a heathen rite, still the
facts which they have exhumed, since the enfranchisement of science, will
lose nothing by repetition. Besides, we propose to examine these facts
from a different and perhaps rather novel point of view: that of the old
philosophies as esoterically understood. These we have barely glanced
at in our first volume. We will use them as the standard by which to
compare Christian dogmas and miracles with the doctrines and phenomena
of ancient magic, and the modern “New Dispensation,” as Spiritualism
is called by its votaries. Since the materialists deny the phenomena

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
without investigation, and since the theologians in admitting them
offer us the poor choice of two palpable absurdities—the Devil and miracles—we
can lose little by applying to the theurgists, and they may actually
help us to throw a great light upon a very dark subject.</p>

<p>Professor A. Butlerof, of the Imperial University of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg,
remarks in a recent pamphlet, entitled <cite>Mediumistic Manifestations</cite>, as
follows: “Let the facts (of modern spiritualism) belong if you will to the
number of those which were more or less known by the ancients; let
them be identical with those which in the dark ages gave importance to
the office of Egyptian priest or Roman augur; let them even furnish the
basis of the sorcery of our Siberian Shaman; ... let them be all these,
and, if they are <em>real facts</em>, it is no business of ours. All the facts in
nature <em>belong to science</em>, and every addition to the store of science enriches
instead of impoverishing her. If humanity has once admitted a
truth, and then in the blindness of self-conceit denied it, to return to its
realization is a step forward and not backward.”</p>

<p>Since the day that modern science gave what may be considered the
death-blow to dogmatic theology, by assuming the ground that religion
was full of mystery, and mystery is unscientific, the mental state of
the educated class has presented a curious aspect. Society seems from
that time to have been ever balancing itself upon one leg, on an unseen
tight-rope stretched from our visible universe into the invisible one; uncertain
whether the end hooked on faith in the latter might not suddenly
break, and hurl it into final annihilation.</p>

<p>The great body of nominal Christians may be divided into three
unequal portions: materialists, spiritualists, and Christians proper. The
materialists and spiritualists make common cause against the hierarchical
pretensions of the clergy; who, in retaliation, denounce both with equal
acerbity. The materialists are as little in harmony as the Christian sects
themselves—the Comtists, or, as they call themselves, the positivists,
being despised and hated to the last degree by the schools of thinkers,
one of which Maudsley honorably represents in England. Positivism, be
it remembered, is that “religion” of the future about whose founder even
Huxley has made himself wrathful in his famous lecture, <cite>The Physical
Basis of Life</cite>; and Maudsley felt obliged, in behalf of,
to express himself thus: “It is no wonder that scientific men should be
anxious to disclaim Comte as their law-giver, and to protest against such
a king being set up to reign over them. Not conscious of any personal
obligation to his writings—conscious how much, in some respects, he has
misrepresented the spirit and pretensions of science—they repudiate the
allegiance which his enthusiastic disciples would force upon them, and
which popular opinion is fast coming to think a natural one. They do

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
well in thus making a timely assertion of independence; for if it be not
done soon, it will soon be too late to be done
 <span class="lock">well.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3" id="FNanchor_3">[3]</a></span>
 When a materialistic
doctrine is repudiated so strongly by two such materialists as
Huxley and Maudsley, then we must think indeed that it is absurdity
itself.</p>

<p>Among Christians there is nothing but dissension. Their various
churches represent every degree of religious belief, from the omnivorous
credulity of blind faith to a condescending and high-toned deference to
the Deity which thinly masks an evident conviction of their own deific
wisdom. All these sects believe more or less in the immortality of the
soul. Some admit the intercourse between the two worlds as a fact;
some entertain the opinion as a sentiment; some positively deny it; and
only a few maintain an attitude of attention and expectancy.</p>

<p>Impatient of restraint, longing for the return of the dark ages, the
Romish Church frowns at the <em>diabolical</em> manifestations, and indicates
what she would do to their champions had she but the power of old.
Were it not for the self-evident fact that she herself is placed by science
on trial, and that she is handcuffed, she would be ready at a moment’s
notice to repeat in the nineteenth century the revolting scenes of former
days. As to the Protestant clergy, so furious is their common hatred
toward spiritualism, that as a secular paper very truly remarks: “They
seem willing to undermine the public faith in all the spiritual phenomena
of the past, as recorded in the <cite>Bible</cite>, if they can only see the pestilent
modern heresy stabbed to the <span class="lock">heart.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4" id="FNanchor_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Summoning back the long-forgotten memories of the Mosaic laws,
the Romish Church claims the monopoly of miracles, and of the right
to sit in judgment over them, as being the sole heir thereto by direct
inheritance. The <cite>Old Testament</cite>, exiled by Colenso, his predecessors
and contemporaries, is recalled from its banishment. The prophets,
whom his Holiness the Pope condescends at last to place, if not on
the same level with himself, at least at a less respectful
 <span class="lock"> distance,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5" id="FNanchor_5">[5]</a></span>
 are
dusted and cleaned. The memory of all the diabolical abracadabra is
evoked anew. The blasphemous <em>horrors</em> perpetrated by Paganism, its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
phallic worship, thaumaturgical wonders wrought by Satan, human sacrifices,
incantations, witchcraft, magic, and sorcery are recalled and
<span class="allsmcap">DEMONISM</span> is confronted with <em>spiritualism</em> for mutual recognition and
identification. Our modern demonologists conveniently overlook a few
insignificant details, among which is the undeniable presence of heathen
phallism in the Christian symbols. A strong spiritual element of this
worship may be easily demonstrated in the dogma of the Immaculate
Conception of the Virgin Mother of God; and a physical element
equally proved in the fetish-worship of the holy <em>limbs</em> of Sts. Cosmo and
Damiano, at Isernia, near Naples; a successful traffic in which <i lang="la">ex-voto</i>
in wax was carried on by the clergy, annually, until barely a half century
<span class="lock">ago.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6" id="FNanchor_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>We find it rather unwise on the part of Catholic writers to pour out
their vials of wrath in such sentences as these: “In a multitude of
pagodas, the phallic stone, ever and always assuming, like the Grecian
<i>batylos</i>, the brutally indecent form of the <i>lingham</i> ... the Maha
 <span class="lock">Deva.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_7" id="FNanchor_7">[7]</a></span>
 Before casting slurs on a symbol whose profound metaphysical
meaning is too much for the modern champions of that religion of
sensualism <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>, Roman Catholicism, to grasp, they are in duty
bound to destroy their oldest churches, and change the form of the cupolas
of their own temples. The Mahody of Elephanta, the Round Tower of
Bhangulpore, the minarets of Islam—either rounded or pointed—are the
originals of the <i lang="it">Campanile</i> column of San Marco, at Venice, of the Rochester
Cathedral, and of the modern Duomo of Milan. All of these steeples,
turrets, domes, and Christian temples, are the reproductions of the primitive
idea of the <i>lithos</i>, the upright phallus. “The western tower of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s
Cathedral, London,” says the author of <cite>The Rosicrucians</cite>, “is one of the
double <i>lithoi</i> placed always in front of every temple, Christian as well as
 <span class="lock">heathen.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8" id="FNanchor_8">[8]</a></span>
 Moreover, in all Christian Churches, “particularly in Protestant
churches, where they figure most conspicuously, the two tables of
stone of the Mosaic Dispensation are placed over the altar, side by side,
as a united stone, the tops of which are rounded.... The right stone is
<em>masculine</em>, the left <em>feminine</em>.” Therefore neither Catholics nor Protestants
have a right to talk of the “indecent forms” of heathen monuments
so long as they ornament their own churches with the symbols of the
Lingham and Yoni, and even write the laws of their God upon them.</p>

<p>Another detail not redounding very particularly to the honor of the
Christian clergy might be recalled in the word Inquisition. The torrents

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of human blood shed by this <em>Christian</em> institution, and the number of
its human sacrifices, are unparalleled in the annals of Paganism. Another
still more prominent feature in which the clergy surpassed their masters,
the “heathen,” is <em>sorcery</em>. Certainly in no Pagan temple was black
magic, in its real and true sense, more practiced than in the Vatican.
While strongly supporting exorcism as an important source of revenue,
they neglected magic as little as the ancient heathen. It is easy to prove
that the <i lang="la">sortilegium</i>, or sorcery, was widely practiced among the clergy
and monks so late as the last century, and is practiced occasionally even
now.</p>

<p>Anathematizing every manifestation of occult nature outside the precincts
of the Church, the clergy—notwithstanding proofs to the contrary—call
it “the work of Satan,” “the snares of the fallen angels,” who
“rush in and out from the bottomless pit,” mentioned by John in his
kabalistic <cite>Revelation</cite>, “from whence arises a smoke as the smoke of a
great furnace.” “<cite>Intoxicated by its fumes, around this pit are daily gathering
millions of Spiritualists, to worship at “the Abyss of</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Baal.</cite>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9" id="FNanchor_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>More than ever arrogant, stubborn, and despotic, now that she has
been nearly upset by modern research, not daring to interfere with the
powerful champions of science, the Latin Church revenges herself upon
the unpopular phenomena. A despot without a victim, is a word
void of sense; a power which neglects to assert itself through outward,
well-calculated effects, risks being doubted in the end. The Church has
no intention to fall into the oblivion of the ancient myths, or to suffer her
authority to be too closely questioned. Hence she pursues, as well as
the times permit, her traditional policy. Lamenting the enforced extinction
of her ally, the Holy Inquisition, she makes a virtue of necessity.
The only victims now within reach are the Spiritists of France. Recent
events have shown that the meek spouse of Christ never disdains to
retaliate on helpless victims.</p>

<p>Having successfully performed her part of <i lang="la">Deus-ex-Machina</i> from
behind the French Bench, which has not scrupled to disgrace itself for
her, the Church of Rome sets to work and shows in the year 1876 what
she can do. From the whirling tables and dancing pencils of profane
Spiritualism, the Christian world is warned to turn to the divine “miracles”
of Lourdes. Meanwhile, the ecclesiastical authorities utilize their
time in arranging for other more easy triumphs, calculated to scare the
superstitious out of their senses. So, acting under orders, the clergy
hurl dramatic, if not very impressive anathemas from every Catholic
diocese; threaten right and left; excommunicate and curse. Perceiving,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
finally, that her thunderbolts directed even against crowned
heads fall about as harmlessly as the Jupiterean lightnings of Offenbach’s
<cite>Calchas</cite>, Rome turns about in powerless fury against the victimized <i lang="fr">protégés</i>
of the Emperor of Russia—the unfortunate Bulgarians and Servians.
Undisturbed by evidence and sarcasm, unbaffled by proof, “the
lamb of the Vatican” impartially divides his wrath between the liberals
of Italy, “the impious whose breath has the stench of the sepulchre,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10" id="FNanchor_10">[10]</a>
the “schismatic Russian <i>Sarmates</i>,” and the heretics and spiritualists,
“who worship at the bottomless pit where the great Dragon lies in
wait.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone went to the trouble of making a catalogue of what he
terms the “flowers of speech,” disseminated through these Papal discourses.
Let us cull a few of the chosen terms used by this vicegerent of
Him who said that, “whosoever shall say <em>Thou fool</em>, shall be in danger of
hell-fire.” They are selected from authentic discourses. Those who
oppose the Pope are “wolves, Pharisees, thieves, liars, hypocrites, dropsical
children of Satan, sons of perdition, of sin, and corruption, satellites
of Satan in human flesh, monsters of hell, demons incarnate, stinking
corpses, men issued from the pits of hell, traitors and Judases led by the
spirit of hell; children of the deepest pits of hell,” etc., etc.; the whole
piously collected and published by Don Pasquale di Franciscis, whom
Gladstone has, with perfect propriety, termed, “an accomplished professor
of <em>flunkeyism</em> in things <span class="lock">spiritual.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11" id="FNanchor_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Since his Holiness the Pope has such a rich vocabulary of invectives
at his command, why wonder that the Bishop of Toulouse did not scruple
to utter the most undignified falsehoods about the Protestants and Spiritualists
of America—people doubly odious to a Catholic—in his address
to his diocese: “Nothing,” he remarks, “is more common in an era of
unbelief than to see a <em>false revelation substitute itself for the true one</em>,
and minds neglect the teachings of the Holy Church, to devote themselves
to the study of divination and the occult sciences.” With a fine
episcopal contempt for statistics, and strangely confounding in his memory
the audiences of the revivalists, Moody and Sankey, and the patrons
of darkened seance-rooms, he utters the unwarranted and fallacious assertion
that “it has been proven that Spiritualism, in the United States,
has caused one-sixth of all the cases of suicide and insanity.” He says
that it is not possible that the spirits “teach either an exact science,
because they are lying demons, or a useful science, because the character

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
of the word of Satan, like Satan himself, is sterile.” He warns his dear
<i lang="fr">collaborateurs</i>, that “the writings in favor of Spiritualism are under the
ban;” and he advises them to let it be known that “to frequent spiritual
circles with the intention of accepting the doctrine, is to apostatize from
the Holy Church, and assume the risk of excommunication;” finally,
says he, “Publish the fact that the teaching of no spirit should prevail
against that of the pulpit of Peter, which is the teaching of the Spirit of
God Himself!!”</p>

<p>Aware of the many false teachings attributed by the Roman Church
to the Creator, we prefer disbelieving the latter assertion. The famous
Catholic theologian, Tillemont, assures us in his work that “all the illustrious
Pagans are condemned to the eternal torments of hell, <em>because</em>
they lived before the time of Jesus, and, therefore, could not be benefited
by the redemption!!” He also assures us that the Virgin Mary personally
testified to this truth over her own signature in a letter to a saint.
Therefore, this is also a revelation—“the Spirit of God Himself” teaching
such charitable doctrines.</p>

<p>We have also read with great advantage the topographical descriptions
of <cite>Hell and Purgatory</cite> in the celebrated treatise under that name
by a Jesuit, the Cardinal Bellarmin. A critic found that the author, who
gives the description from a <em>divine</em> vision with which he was favored,
“appears to possess all the knowledge of a land-measurer” about the
secret tracts and formidable divisions of the “bottomless pit.” Justin
Martyr having actually committed to paper the heretical thought that
after all Socrates might not be altogether fixed in hell, his Benedictine
editor criticises this too benevolent father very severely. Whoever
doubts the Christian charity of the Church of Rome in this direction is
invited to peruse the <cite>Censure</cite> of the Sorbonne, on Marmontel’s <cite>Belisarius</cite>.
The <i lang="la">odium theologicum</i> blazes in it on the dark sky of orthodox
theology like an aurora borealis—the precursor of God’s wrath, according
to the teaching of certain mediæval divines.</p>

<p>We have attempted in the first part of this work to show, by historical
examples, how completely men of science have deserved the stinging
sarcasm of the late Professor de Morgan, who remarked of them
that “they wear the priest’s cast-off garb, dyed to escape detection.”
The Christian clergy are, in like manner, attired in the cast-off garb of
the <em>heathen</em> priesthood; acting diametrically in opposition to their <em>God’s</em>
moral precepts, but nevertheless, sitting in judgment over the whole
world.</p>

<p>When dying on the cross, the martyred Man of Sorrows forgave his
enemies. His last words were a prayer in their behalf. He taught his
disciples to curse not, but to bless, even their foes. But the heirs of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, the self constituted representatives on earth of that same meek
Jesus, unhesitatingly curse whoever resists their despotic will. Besides,
was not the “Son” long since crowded by them into the background?
They make their obeisance only to the Dowager Mother, for—according
to their teaching—again through “the direct Spirit of God,” she alone
acts as a mediatrix. The Œcumenical Council of 1870 embodied the
teaching into a dogma, to disbelieve which is to be doomed forever to
the ‘bottomless pit.’ The work of Don Pasquale di Franciscis is positive
on that point; for he tells us that, as the Queen of Heaven owes to
the present Pope “the finest gem in her coronet,” since he has conferred
on her the unexpected honor of becoming suddenly immaculate, there is
nothing she cannot obtain from her Son for “her <span class="lock">Church.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12" id="FNanchor_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Some years ago, certain travellers saw in Barri, Italy, a statue of the
Madonna, arrayed in a flounced pink skirt over a swelling <em>crinoline</em>!
Pious pilgrims who may be anxious to examine the regulation wardrobe
of their God’s mother may do so by going to Southern Italy, Spain, and
Catholic North and South America. The Madonna of Barri must still
be there—between two vineyards and a <i lang="it">locanda</i> (gin-shop). When last
seen, a half-successful attempt had been made to clothe the infant Jesus;
they had covered his legs with a pair of dirty, scollop-edged pantaloons.
An English traveller having presented the “Mediatrix” with a green
silk parasol, the grateful population of the <i lang="it">contadini</i>, accompanied by the
village priest, went in procession to the spot. They managed to stick
the sunshade, opened, between the infant’s back and the arm of the
Virgin which embraced him. The scene and ceremony were both solemn
and highly refreshing to our religious feelings. For there stood the
image of the goddess in its niche, surrounded with a row of ever-burning
lamps, the flames of which, flickering in the breeze, infect God’s pure air
with an offensive smell of olive oil. The Mother and Son truly represent
the two most conspicuous idols of <em>Monotheistic</em> Christianity!</p>

<p>For a companion to the idol of the poor <i lang="it">contadini</i> of Barri, go to the
rich city of Rio Janeiro. In the Church of the Duomo del Candelaria,
in a long hall running along one side of the church, there might be seen,
a few years ago, another Madonna. Along the walls of the hall there is
a line of saints, each standing on a contribution-box, which thus forms a
fit pedestal. In the centre of this line, under a gorgeously rich canopy
of blue silk, is exhibited the Virgin Mary leaning on the arm of Christ.
“Our Lady” is arrayed in a very <i lang="fr">décolleté</i> blue satin dress with short

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
sleeves, showing, to great advantage, a snow-white, exquisitely-moulded
neck, shoulders, and arms. The skirt equally of blue satin with an overskirt
of rich lace and gauze puffs, is as short as that of a ballet-dancer;
hardly reaching the knee, it exhibits a pair of finely-shaped legs covered
with flesh colored silk tights, and blue satin French boots with very high
red heels! The blonde hair of this “Mother of God” is arranged in
the latest fashion, with a voluminous <i lang="fr">chignon</i> and curls. As she leans on
her Son’s arm, her face is lovingly turned toward her Only-Begotten,
whose dress and attitude are equally worthy of admiration. Christ wears
an evening dress-coat, with swallow-tail, black trousers, and low cut
white vest; varnished boots, and white kid gloves, <em>over one of which</em> sparkles
a rich diamond ring, worth many thousands we must suppose—a
precious Brazilian jewel. Above this body of a modern Portuguese dandy,
is a head with the hair parted in the middle; a sad and solemn face,
and eyes whose patient look seems to reflect all the bitterness of this
last insult flung at the majesty of the <span class="lock">Crucified.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13" id="FNanchor_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptian Isis was also represented as a Virgin Mother by her
devotees, and as holding her infant son, Horus, in her arms. In some
statues and <i lang="it">basso-relievos</i>, when she appears alone she is either completely
nude or veiled from head to foot. But in the Mysteries, in common
with nearly every other goddess, she is entirely veiled from head to foot,
as a symbol of a mother’s chastity. It would not do us any harm were
we to borrow from the ancients some of the poetic sentiment in their
religions, and the innate veneration they entertained for <em>their</em> symbols.</p>

<p>It is but fair to say at once that the last of the <em>true</em> Christians died
with the last of the direct apostles. Max Müller forcibly asks: “How
can a missionary in such circumstances meet the surprise and questions
of his pupils, unless he may point to that
 <span class="lock"> seed,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14" id="FNanchor_14">[14]</a></span>
 and tell them what
Christianity was meant to be? unless he may show that, like all other religions,
Christianity too, has had its history; that the Christianity of the
nineteenth century is not the Christianity of the middle ages, and that
the Christianity of the middle ages was not that of the early Councils;
that the Christianity of the early Councils was not that of the Apostles,
and that what has been said by Christ, that alone was well <span class="lock">said?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15" id="FNanchor_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we may infer that the only characteristic difference between
modern Christianity and the old heathen faiths is the belief of the former
in a personal devil and in hell. “The Aryan nations had no devil,”
says Max Müller. “Pluto, though of a sombre character, was a very

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
respectable personage; and Loki (the Scandinavian), though a mischievous
person, was not a fiend. The German Goddess, Hell, too, like
Proserpine, had once seen better days. Thus, when the Germans were
indoctrinated with the idea of a real devil, the Semitic Seth, Satan or
Diabolus, they treated him in the most good-humored way.”</p>

<p>The same may be said of hell. Hades was quite a different place from
our region of eternal damnation, and might be termed rather an intermediate
state of purification. Neither does the Scandinavian <i>Hel</i> or
Hela, imply either a state or a place of punishment; for when Frigga,
the grief-stricken mother of Bal-dur, the white god, who died and found
himself in the dark abodes of the shadows (Hades) sent Hermod, a son
of Thor, in quest of her beloved child, the messenger found him in the
inexorable region—alas! but still comfortably seated on a rock, and
reading a
 <span class="lock"> book.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16" id="FNanchor_16">[16]</a></span>
 The Norse kingdom of the dead is moreover situated
in the higher latitudes of the Polar regions; it is a cold and cheerless
abode, and neither the gelid halls of Hela, nor the occupation of Baldur
present the least similitude to the blazing hell of eternal fire and the
miserable “damned” sinners with which the Church so generously peoples
it. No more is it the Egyptian Amenthes, the region of judgment and
purification; nor the Onderâh—the abyss of darkness of the Hindus;
for even the fallen angels hurled into it by Siva, are allowed by Parabrahma
to consider it as an intermediate state, in which an opportunity
is afforded them to prepare for higher degrees of purification and redemption
from their wretched condition. The Gehenna of the <cite>New Testament</cite>
was a locality outside the walls of Jerusalem; and in mentioning
it, Jesus used but an ordinary metaphor. Whence then came the dreary
dogma of hell, that Archimedean lever of Christian theology, with which
they have succeeded to hold in subjection the numberless millions of
Christians for nineteen centuries? Assuredly not from the Jewish
Scriptures, and we appeal for corroboration to any well-informed Hebrew
scholar.</p>

<p>The only designation of something approaching hell in the <cite>Bible</cite> is
<i>Gehenna</i> or Hinnom, a valley near Jerusalem, where was situated Tophet,
a place where a fire was perpetually kept for sanitary purposes. The
prophet Jeremiah informs us that the Israelites used to sacrifice their
children to Moloch-Hercules on that spot; and later we find Christians
quietly replacing this divinity by their god of <em>mercy</em>, whose wrath
will not be appeased, unless the Church sacrifices to him her unbaptized
children and sinning sons on the altar of “eternal damnation!”</p>

<p>Whence then did the divine learn so well the conditions of hell, as

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
to actually divide its torments into two kinds, the <i lang="la">pæna damni</i> and pænæ
sensus, the former being the privation of the beatific vision; the latter
the <em>eternal</em> pains <em>in a lake of fire and brimstone</em>? If they answer us that
it is in the <cite>Apocalypse</cite> (<abbr title="twenty">xx.</abbr> 10), we are prepared to demonstrate whence
the theologist John himself derived the idea, “And <em>the devil</em> that deceived
them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where <em>the beast</em> and
the false prophet are and shall be tormented for ever and ever,” he
says. Laying aside the esoteric interpretation that the “devil” or
tempting demon meant our own earthly body, which after death will
surely dissolve in the <em>fiery</em> or ethereal
 <span class="lock"> elements,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17" id="FNanchor_17">[17]</a></span>
 the
word “eternal” by which our theologians interpret the words “for
ever and ever” does not exist in the Hebrew language, either as a
word or meaning. There is no Hebrew word which properly expresses
<em>eternity</em>; עולם <i>oulam</i>, according to Le Clerc, only
imports a time whose beginning or end is not known. While showing
that this word does not mean <em>infinite</em> duration, and that
in the <cite>Old Testament</cite> the word <cite>forever</cite> only signifies a long time, Archbishop
Tillotson has completely perverted its sense with respect to the
idea of hell-torments. According to his doctrine, when Sodom and
Gomorrah are said to be suffering “eternal fire,” we must understand it
only in the sense of that fire not being extinguished till both cities were
entirely consumed. But, as to hell-fire the words must be understood in
the strictest sense of infinite duration. Such is the decree of the learned
divine. For the duration of the punishment of the wicked must be
proportionate to the eternal happiness of the righteous. So he says,
“These (speaking of the wicked) “shall go away εις κόλασιν αιῶνιον into
<em>eternal</em> punishment; but the righteous εις ζωην αιωνιον into life eternal.”</p>

<p>The Reverend T.
 <span class="lock"> Surnden,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18" id="FNanchor_18">[18]</a></span>
 commenting on the speculations of his
predecessors, fills a whole volume with unanswerable arguments, tending
to show that the locality <em>of Hell is in the sun</em>. We suspect that the reverend
speculator had read the <cite>Apocalypse</cite> in bed, and had the nightmare
in consequence. There are two verses in the <cite>Revelation of John</cite>
reading thus: “And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun,
and power was given him to scorch men with fire. And men were
scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of
 <span class="lock"> God.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_19" id="FNanchor_19">[19]</a></span>
 This is
simply Pythagorean and kabalistic allegory. The idea is new neither with
the above-mentioned author nor with John. Pythagoras placed the
“sphere of purification in the sun,” which sun, with its sphere, he moreover

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
locates in the middle of the
 <span class="lock"> universe,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_20" id="FNanchor_20">[20]</a></span>
 the allegory having a double meaning:
1. Symbolically, the central, spiritual sun, the Supreme Deity.
Arrived at this region every soul becomes purified of its sins, and unites
itself forever with its spirit, having previously suffered throughout all the
lower spheres. 2. By placing the sphere of <em>visible</em> fire in the middle of
the universe, he simply taught the heliocentric system which appertained
to the Mysteries, and was imparted only in the higher degree of initiation.
John gives to his Word a purely kabalistic significance, which no “Fathers,”
except those who had belonged to the Neo-platonic school, were able to
comprehend. Origen understood it well, having been a pupil of Ammonius
Saccas; therefore we see him bravely denying the perpetuity of hell-torments.
He maintains that not only men, but even devils (by which
term he meant disembodied human sinners), after a certain duration of
punishment shall be pardoned and finally restored to
 <span class="lock"> heaven.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_21" id="FNanchor_21">[21]</a></span>
 In consequence
of this and other such heresies Origen was, as a matter of
course, exiled.</p>

<p>Many have been the learned and truly-inspired speculations as to the
locality of hell. The most popular were those which placed it in the
centre of the earth. At a certain time, however, skeptical doubts which
disturbed the placidity of faith in this highly-refreshing doctrine arose in
consequence of the meddling scientists of those days. As a Mr. Swinden
in our own century observes, the theory was inadmissible because of two
objections: 1st, that a fund of fuel or sulphur sufficient to maintain so
furious and constant a fire could not be there supposed; and, <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr>, that it
must want the nitrous particles in the air to sustain and keep it alive.
“And how,” says he, “can a fire be eternal, when, by degrees, the whole
substance of the earth must be consumed <span class="lock">thereby?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_22" id="FNanchor_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The skeptical gentleman had evidently forgotten that centuries ago <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine solved the difficulty. Have we not the word of this learned
divine that hell, nevertheless, <em>is</em> in the centre of the earth, for “God supplies
the central fire with air <em>by a miracle</em>?” The argument is unanswerable,
and so we will not seek to upset it.</p>

<p>The Christians were the first to make the existence of Satan a dogma
of the Church. And once that she had established it, she had to
struggle for over 1,700 years for the repression of a mysterious force
which it was her policy to make appear of diabolical origin. Unfortunately,
in manifesting itself, this force invariably tends to upset such
a belief by the ridiculous discrepancy it presents between the alleged
cause and the effects. If the clergy have not over-estimated the real power

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of the “Arch-Enemy of God,” it must be confessed that he takes mighty
precautions against being recognized as the “Prince of Darkness” who
aims at our souls. If modern “spirits” are devils at all, as preached
by the clergy, then they can only be those “poor” or “stupid devils”
whom Max Müller describes as appearing so often in the German and
Norwegian tales.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, the clergy fear above all to be forced to relinquish
this hold on humanity. They are not willing to let us judge of the
tree by its fruits, for that might sometimes force them into dangerous dilemmas.
They refuse, likewise, to admit, with unprejudiced people, that
the phenomena of Spiritualism has unquestionably spiritualized and reclaimed
from evil courses many an indomitable atheist and skeptic. But, as
they confess themselves, what is the use in a Pope, if there is no Devil?</p>

<p>And so Rome sends her ablest advocates and preachers to the rescue
of those perishing in “the bottomless pit.” Rome employs her cleverest
writers for this purpose—albeit they all indignantly deny the accusation—and
in the preface to every book put forth by the prolific des Mousseaux,
the French Tertullian of our century, we find undeniable proofs of the
fact. Among other certificates of ecclesiastical approval, every volume is
ornamented with the text of a certain original letter addressed to the very
pious author by the world-known Father Ventura de Raulica, of Rome.
Few are those who have not heard this famous name. It is the name of
one of the chief pillars of the Latin Church, the ex-General of the Order
of the Theatins, Consultor of the Sacred Congregation of Rites, Examiner
of Bishops, and of the Roman Clergy, etc., etc., etc. This strikingly
characteristic document will remain to astonish future generations by
its spirit of unsophisticated demonolatry and unblushing sincerity. We
translate a fragment verbatim, and by thus helping its circulation hope to
merit the blessings of Mother
 <span class="lock">Church:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_23" id="FNanchor_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span></div>

<p>A-men!</p>

<p>This is an unexpected honor indeed, for our American “controls” in
general, and the innocent “Indian guides” in particular. To be thus
introduced in Rome as princes of the Empire of Eblis, is more than they
could ever hope for in other lands.</p>

<p>Without in the least suspecting that she was working for the future
welfare of her enemies—the spiritualists and spiritists—the Church, some
twenty years since, in tolerating des Mousseaux and de Mirville as the
biographers of the Devil, and giving her approbation thereto, tacitly confessed
the literary copartnership.</p>

<p>M. the Chevalier Gougenot des Mousseaux, and his friend and collaborateur,
the Marquis Eudes de Mirville, to judge by their long titles,
must be aristocrats <i lang="fr">pur sang</i>, and they are, moreover, writers of no small
erudition and talent. Were they to show themselves a little more parsimonious
of double points of exclamation following every vituperation,
and invective against Satan and his worshippers, their style would be faultless.
As it is, the crusade against the enemy of mankind was fierce, and
lasted for over twenty years.</p>

<p>What with the Catholics piling up their psychological phenomena to
prove the existence of a personal devil, and the Count de Gasparin, an
ancient minister of Louis Philippe, collecting volumes of other facts to
prove the contrary, the spiritists of France have contracted an everlasting
debt of gratitude toward the disputants. The existence of an unseen
spiritual universe peopled with invisible beings has now been demonstrated
beyond question. Ransacking the oldest libraries, they have distilled
from the historical records the quintessence of evidence. All
epochs, from the Homeric ages down to the present day, have supplied
their choicest materials to these indefatigable authors. In trying to prove
the authenticity of the miracles wrought by Satan in the days preceding
the Christian era, as well as throughout the middle ages, they have simply
laid a firm foundation for a study of the phenomena in our modern
times.</p>

<p>Though an ardent, uncompromising enthusiast, des Mousseaux unwittingly
transforms himself into the tempting demon, or—as he is fond
of calling the Devil—the “serpent of <cite>Genesis</cite>.” In his desire to demonstrate
in every manifestation the presence of the Evil One, he only succeeds
in demonstrating that Spiritualism and magic are no new things in
the world, but very ancient twin-brothers, whose origin must be sought
for in the earliest infancy of ancient India, Chaldea, Babylonia, Egypt,
Persia, and Greece.</p>

<p>He proves the existence of “spirits,” whether these be angels or
devils, with such a clearness of argument and logic, and such an amount

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of evidence, historical, irrefutable, and strictly authenticated, that little is
left for spiritualist authors who may come after him. How unfortunate
that the scientists, who believe neither in devil nor spirit, are more than
likely to ridicule M. des Mousseaux’s books without reading them, for
they really contain so many facts of profound scientific interest!</p>

<p>But what can we expect in our own age of unbelief, when we find
Plato, over twenty-two centuries ago, complaining of the same? “Me,
too,” says he, in his <cite>Euthyphron</cite>, “when I say anything in the public
assembly concerning divine things, <em>and predict to them</em> what is going to
happen, they ridicule as mad; and although <em>nothing that I have predicted
has proved untrue</em>, yet they envy all such men as we are. However, we
ought not to heed, but pursue our own way.”</p>

<p>The literary resources of the Vatican and other Catholic repositories
of learning must have been freely placed at the disposal of these modern
authors. When one has such treasures at hand—original manuscripts,
papyri, and books pillaged from the richest heathen libraries; old treatises
on magic and alchemy; and records of all the trials for witchcraft,
and sentences for the same to rack, stake, and torture, it is mighty easy
to write volumes of accusations against the Devil. We affirm on good
grounds that there are hundreds of the most valuable works on the occult
sciences, which are sentenced to eternal concealment from the public,
but are attentively read and studied by the privileged who have access to
the Vatican Library. The laws of nature are the same for heathen sorcerer
as for Catholic saint; and a “miracle” may be produced as well by
one as by the other, without the slightest intervention of God or devil.</p>

<p>Hardly had the manifestations begun to attract attention in Europe,
than the clergy commenced their outcry that their traditional enemy had
reappeared under another name, and “divine miracles” also began to
be heard of in isolated instances. First they were confined to humble
individuals, some of whom claimed to have them produced through the
intervention of the Virgin Mary, saints and angels; others—according to
the clergy—began to suffer from <em>obsession</em> and <em>possession</em>; for the Devil
must have his share of fame as well as the Deity. Finding that, notwithstanding
the warning, the <em>independent</em>, or so-called spiritual phenomena
went on increasing and multiplying, and that these manifestations
threatened to upset the carefully-constructed dogmas of the Church,
the world was suddenly startled by extraordinary intelligence. In 1864,
a whole community became possessed of the Devil. Morzine, and the
awful stories of its demoniacs; Valleyres, and the narratives of its well-authenticated
exhibitions of sorcery; and those of the Presbytere de
Cideville curdled the blood in Catholic veins.</p>

<p>Strange to say, the question has been asked over and over again,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
why the “divine” miracles and most of the obsessions are so strictly
confined to Roman Catholic dioceses and countries? Why is it that
since the Reformation there has been scarcely one single divine “miracle”
in a Protestant land? Of course, the answer we must expect from
Catholics is, that the latter are peopled by <em>heretics</em>, and abandoned by
God. Then why are there no more Church-miracles in Russia, a country
whose religion differs from the Roman Catholic faith but in external
forms of rites, its fundamental dogmas being identically the same, except
as to the emanation of the Holy Ghost? Russia has her accepted saints
and thaumaturgical relics, and miracle-working images. The <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mitrophaniy
of Voroneg is an authenticated miracle-worker, but his miracles
are limited to healing; and though hundreds upon hundreds have been
healed <em>through faith</em>, and though the old cathedral is full of magnetic effluvia,
and whole generations will go on <em>believing</em> in his power, and some
persons will always be healed, still no such miracles are heard of in Russia
as the Madonna-walking, and Madonna letter-writing, and statue-talking
of Catholic countries. Why is this so? Simply because the emperors
have strictly forbidden that sort of thing. The Czar, Peter the Great,
stopped every spurious “divine” miracle with one frown of his mighty
brow. He declared he would have <em>no false</em> miracles played by the holy
<i>icones</i> (images of saints), and they disappeared <span class="lock">forever.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_24" id="FNanchor_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>There are cases on record of isolated and independent phenomena
exhibited by certain images in the last century; the latest was the bleeding
of the cheek of an image of the Virgin, when a soldier of Napoleon
cut her face in two. This miracle, alleged to have happened in 1812, in
the days of the invasion by the “grand army,” was the final farewell.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_25" id="FNanchor_25">[25]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
But since then, although the three successive emperors have been pious
men, their will has been respected, and the images and saints have
remained quiet, and hardly been spoken of except as connected with
religious worship. In Poland, a land of furious ultramontanism, there
were, at different times, desperate attempts at miracle-doing. They died
at birth, however, for the argus-eyed police were there; a Catholic miracle
in Poland, made public by the priests, generally meaning political
revolution, bloodshed, and war.</p>

<p>Is it then, not permissible to at least suspect that if, in one country
divine miracles may be arrested by civil and military law, and in another
they <em>never occur</em>, we must search for the explanation of the two facts in
some natural cause, instead of attributing them to either god or devil?
In our opinion—if it is worth anything—the whole secret may be
accounted for as follows. In Russia, the clergy know better than to
bewilder their parishes, whose piety is sincere and faith strong without
miracles; they know that nothing is better calculated than the latter to
sow seeds of distrust, doubt, and finally of skepticism which leads directly
to atheism. Moreover the climate is less propitious, and the magnetism
of the average population too positive, <em>too healthy</em>, to call forth <em>independent</em>
phenomena; and fraud would not answer. On the other hand,
neither in Protestant Germany, nor England, nor yet in America, since
the days of the Reformation, has the clergy had access to any of the Vatican
secret libraries. Hence they are all but poor hands at the magic of
Albertus Magnus.</p>

<p>As for America being overflowed with sensitives and mediums, the
reason for it is partially attributable to climatic influence and especially
to the physiological condition of the population. Since the days of the
Salem witchcraft, 200 years ago, when the comparatively few settlers had
pure and unadulterated blood in their veins, nothing much had been
heard of “spirits” or “mediums” until
 <span class="lock"> 1840.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_26" id="FNanchor_26">[26]</a></span>
 The phenomena then
first appeared among the ascetic and exalted Shakers, whose religious
aspirations, peculiar mode of life, moral purity, and physical chastity
all led to the production of independent phenomena of a psychological

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
as well as physical nature. Hundreds of thousands, and even millions
of men from various climates and of different constitutions and habits,
have, since 1692, invaded North America, and by intermarrying have substantially
changed the physical type of the inhabitants. Of what country
in the world do the women’s constitutions bear comparison with the delicate,
nervous, and sensitive constitutions of the feminine portion of the
population of the United States? We were struck on our arrival in the
country with the semi-transparent delicacy of skin of the natives of both
sexes. Compare a hard-working Irish factory girl or boy, with one from
a genuine American family. Look at their hands. One works as hard
as the other; they are of equal age, and both seemingly healthy; and
still, while the hands of the one, after an hour’s soaping, will show a skin
little softer than that of a young alligator, those of the other, notwithstanding
constant use, will allow you to observe the circulation of the
blood under the thin and delicate epidermis. No wonder, then, that
while America is the conservatory of sensitives the majority of its clergy,
unable to produce divine or any other miracles, stoutly deny the possibility
of any phenomena except those produced by tricks and juggling.
And no wonder also that the Catholic priesthood, who are practically
aware of the existence of magic and spiritual phenomena, and believe in
them while dreading their consequences, try to attribute the whole to the
agency of the Devil.</p>

<p>Let us adduce one more argument, if only for the sake of circumstantial
evidence. In what countries have “divine miracles” flourished
most, been most frequent and most stupendous? Catholic Spain, and
Pontifical Italy, beyond question. And which more than these two, has
had access to ancient literature? Spain was famous for her libraries;
the Moors were celebrated for their profound learning in alchemy and
other sciences. The Vatican is the storehouse of an immense number
of ancient manuscripts. During the long interval of nearly 1,500 years
they have been accumulating, from trial after trial, books and manuscripts
confiscated from their sentenced victims, to their own profit. The Catholics
may plead that the books were generally committed to the flames;
that the treatises of famous sorcerers and enchanters perished with their
accursed authors. But the Vatican, if it could speak, could tell a different
story. It knows too well of the existence of certain closets and
rooms, access to which is had but by the very few. It knows that the
entrances to these secret hiding-places are so cleverly concealed from
sight in the carved frame-work and under the profuse ornamentation of
the library-walls, that there have even been Popes who lived and died
within the precincts of the palace without ever suspecting their existence.
But these Popes were neither Sylvester <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>,
 Benedict <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, John <abbr title="Twenty">XX.</abbr>, nor

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
the <abbr title="Sixth">VIth</abbr> and <abbr title="Seventh">VIIth</abbr> Gregory; nor yet the famous Borgia of toxicological
memory. Neither were those who remained ignorant of the hidden lore
friends of the sons of Loyola.</p>

<p>Where, in the records of European Magic, can we find cleverer
enchanters than in the mysterious solitudes of the cloister? Albert
Magnus, the famous Bishop and conjurer of Ratisbon, was never surpassed
in his art. Roger Bacon was a monk, and Thomas Aquinas one
of the most learned pupils of Albertus. Trithemius, Abbot of the
Spanheim Benedictines, was the teacher, friend, and confidant of Cornelius
Agrippa; and while the confederations of the Theosophists were
scattered broadcast about Germany, where they first originated, assisting
one another, and struggling for years for the acquirement of esoteric
knowledge, any person who knew how to become the favored pupil of certain
monks, might very soon be proficient in all the important branches
of occult learning.</p>

<p>This is all in history and cannot be easily denied. Magic, in all its
aspects, was widely and nearly openly practiced by the clergy till the
Reformation. And even he who was once called the “Father of the
Reformation,” the famous John
 <span class="lock"> Reuchlin,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_27" id="FNanchor_27">[27]</a></span>
 author of the <cite>Mirific Word</cite>
and friend of Pico di Mirandola, the teacher and instructor of Erasmus,
Luther, and Melancthon, was a kabalist and occultist.</p>

<p>The ancient <i lang="la">Sortilegium</i>, or divination by means of <i>Sortes</i> or lots—an
art and practice now decried by the clergy as an abomination, designated
by <cite>Stat. 10 Jac.</cite> as
 <span class="lock"> felony,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_28" id="FNanchor_28">[28]</a></span>
 and by <i>Stat. 12 Carolus <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></i> excepted
out of the general pardons, on the ground of being <em>sorcery</em>—was
widely practiced by the clergy and monks. Nay, it was sanctioned
by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine himself, who does not “disapprove of this method of
learning futurity, provided it be not used for worldly purposes.” More
than that, he confesses having practiced it <span class="lock">himself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_29" id="FNanchor_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Aye; but the clergy called it <i lang="la">Sortes Sanctorum</i>, when it was they
who practiced it; while the <i lang="la">Sortes Prænestinæ</i>, succeeded by the <i lang="la">Sortes
Homericæ</i> and <i lang="la">Sortes Virgilianæ</i>, were abominable <em>heathenism</em>, the
worship of the Devil, when used by any one else.</p>

<p>Gregory de Tours informs us that when the clergy resorted to the
<i>Sortes</i> their custom was to lay the <cite>Bible</cite> on the altar, and to pray the
Lord that He would discover His will, and disclose to them futurity in
one of the verses of the book. Gilbert de Nogent writes that in his days

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
(about the twelfth century) the custom was, at the consecration of
bishops, to consult the <cite>Sortes Sanctorum</cite>, to thereby learn the success
and fate of the episcopate. On the other hand, we are told that the <cite>Sortes
Sanctorum</cite> were condemned by the Council of Agda, in 506. In this
case again we are left to inquire, in which instance has the infallibility of
the Church failed? Was it when she prohibited that which was practiced
by her greatest saint and patron, Augustine, or in the twelfth century,
when it was openly and with the sanction of the same Church practiced
by the clergy for the benefit of the bishop’s elections? Or, must we still
believe that in both of these contradictory cases the Vatican was inspired
by the direct “spirit of God?”</p>

<p>If any doubt that Gregory of Tours approved of a practice that prevails
to this day, more or less, even among strict Protestants, let them
read this: “Lendastus, Earl of Tours, who was for ruining me with
Queen Fredegonde, coming to Tours, big with evil designs against me, I
withdrew to my oratory under a deep concern, where I took the <cite>Psalms</cite>....
My heart revived within me when I cast my eyes on this of the
seventy-seventh <cite>Psalm</cite>: ‘He caused them to go on with confidence,
whilst the sea swallowed up their enemies.’ Accordingly, the count
spoke not a word to my prejudice; and leaving Tours that very day, the
boat in which he was, sunk in a storm, but his skill in swimming saved
him.”</p>

<p>The sainted bishop simply confesses here to having practiced a bit of
sorcery. <em>Every mesmerizer knows the power of will during an intense
desire bent on any particular subject.</em> Whether in consequence of “co-incidents”
or otherwise, the opened verse suggested to his mind revenge
by drowning. Passing the remainder of the day in “deep concern,” and
possessed by this all-absorbing thought, the saint—it may be unconsciously—exercises
his will on the subject; and thus while imagining in the accident
the hand of God, he simply becomes a sorcerer exercising his magnetic
will which reacts on the person feared; and the count barely
escapes with his life. Were the accident decreed by God, the culprit
would have been drowned; for a simple bath could not have altered his
malevolent resolution against <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gregory had he been very intent on it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we find anathemas fulminated against this lottery of
fate, at the council of Varres, which forbids “all ecclesiastics, under pain
of excommunication, to perform that kind of divination, or to pry into
futurity, by looking into any book, or writing, whatsoever.” The same
prohibition is pronounced at the councils of Agda in 506, of Orleans, in
511, of Auxerre in 595, and finally at the council of Aenham in 1110;
the latter condemning “sorcerers, witches, diviners, such as occasioned
death by magical operations, and who practiced fortune-telling by the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
holy-book lots;” and the complaint of the joint clergy against de Garlande,
their bishop at Orleans, and addressed to Pope Alexander <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>,
concludes in this manner: “Let your apostolical hands put on strength
to <em>strip naked</em> the iniquity of this man, that the curse prognosticated on
the day of his consecration may overtake him; for the gospels being
opened on the altar <em>according to custom</em>, the first words were: <cite>and the
young man, leaving his linen cloth, fled from them</cite> <span class="lock"><cite>naked</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_30" id="FNanchor_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Why then roast the lay-magicians and consulters of books, and canonize
the ecclesiastics? Simply because the mediæval as well as the
modern phenomena, manifested through laymen, whether produced
through occult knowledge or happening independently, upset the claims
of both the Catholic and Protestant Churches to divine miracles. In the
face of reiterated and unimpeachable evidence it became impossible for
the former to maintain successfully the assertion that seemingly miraculous
manifestations by the “good angels” and God’s direct intervention
could be produced exclusively by her chosen ministers and holy saints.
Neither could the Protestant well maintain on the same ground that
miracles had ended with the apostolic ages. For, whether of the same
nature or not, the modern phenomena claimed close kinship with the
biblical ones. The magnetists and healers of our century came into
direct and open competition with the apostles. The Zouave Jacob, of
France, had outrivalled the prophet Elijah in recalling to life persons
who were seemingly dead; and Alexis, the somnambulist, mentioned by
Mr. Wallace in his
 <span class="lock"> work,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_31" id="FNanchor_31">[31]</a></span>
 was, by his lucidity, putting to shame apostles,
prophets, and the Sibyls of old. Since the burning of the last witch, the
great Revolution of France, so elaborately prepared by the league of
the secret societies and their clever emissaries, had blown over Europe
and awakened terror in the bosom of the clergy. It had, like a destroying
hurricane, swept away in its course those best allies of the Church,
the Roman Catholic aristocracy. A sure foundation was now laid for
the right of individual opinion. The world was freed from ecclesiastical
tyranny by opening an unobstructed path to Napoleon the Great, who
had given the deathblow to the Inquisition. This great slaughter-house
of the Christian Church—wherein she butchered, in the name of the
Lamb, all the sheep arbitrarily declared scurvy—was in ruins, and she
found herself left to her own responsibility and resources.</p>

<p>So long as the phenomena had appeared only sporadically, she had
always felt herself powerful enough to repress the consequences. Superstition

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
and belief in the Devil were as strong as ever, and Science had not
yet dared to publicly measure her forces with those of supernatural Religion.
Meanwhile the enemy had slowly but surely gained ground. All at once
it broke out with an unexpected violence. “Miracles” began to appear
in full daylight, and passed from their mystic seclusion into the domain
of natural law, where the profane hand of Science was ready to strip off
their sacerdotal mask. Still, for a time, the Church held her position, and
with the powerful help of superstitious fear checked the progress of the
intruding force. But, when in succession appeared mesmerists and somnambulists,
reproducing the physical and mental phenomenon of ecstasy,
hitherto believed to be the special gift of saints; when the passion for
the turning tables had reached in France and elsewhere its climax of
fury; when the psychography—alleged spiritual—from a simple curiosity
had developed itself and settled into an unabated interest, and finally
ebbed into religious mysticism; when the echoes aroused by the first raps
of Rochester, crossing the oceans, spread until they were re-percussed from
nearly every corner of the world—then, and only then, the Latin Church
was fully awakened to a sense of danger. Wonder after wonder was
reported to have occurred in the spiritual circles and the lecture-rooms
of the mesmerists; the sick were healed, the blind made to see, the lame
to walk, the deaf to hear. J. R. Newton in America, and Du Potet in
France, were healing the multitude without the slightest claim to divine
intervention. The great discovery of Mesmer, which reveals to the
earnest inquirer the mechanism of nature, mastered, as if by magical
power, organic and inorganic bodies.</p>

<p>But this was not the worst. A more direful calamity for the Church
occurred in the evocation from the upper and nether worlds of a multitude
of “spirits,” whose private bearing and conversation gave the direct
lie to the most cherished and profitable dogmas of the Church. These
“spirits” claimed to be the identical entities, in a disembodied state, of
fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters, friends and acquaintances of the
persons viewing the weird phenomena. The Devil seemed to have no
objective existence, and this struck at the very foundation upon which
the chair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter
 <span class="lock"> rested.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_32" id="FNanchor_32">[32]</a></span>
 Not a spirit except the mocking mannikins

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
of Planchette would confess to the most distant relationship with the
Satanic majesty, or accredit him with the governorship of a single inch
of territory. The clergy felt their prestige growing weaker every day,
as they saw the people impatiently shaking off, in the broad daylight
of truth, the dark veils with which they had been blindfolded for so many
centuries. Then finally, fortune, which previously had been on their side
in the long-waged conflict between theology and science, deserted to
their adversary. The help of the latter to the study of the occult side of
nature was truly precious and timely, and science has unwittingly widened
the once narrow path of the phenomena into a broad highway. Had not

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
this conflict culminated at the nick of time, we might have seen, reproduced
on a miniature scale the disgraceful scenes of the episodes of
Salem witchcraft and the Nuns of Loudun. As it was, the clergy were
muzzled.</p>

<p>But if science has unintentionally helped the progress of the occult
phenomena, the latter have reciprocally aided science herself. Until
the days when newly-reincarnated philosophy boldly claimed its place in
the world, there had been but few scholars who had undertaken the difficult
task of studying comparative theology. This science occupies a domain
heretofore penetrated by few explorers. The necessity which it involved
of being well acquainted with the dead languages, necessarily limited the
number of students. Besides, there was less popular need for it so long
as people could not replace the Christian orthodoxy by something more
tangible. It is one of the most undeniable facts of psychology, that the
average man can as little exist out of a religious element of some kind,
as a fish out of the water. The voice of truth, “a voice stronger than
the voice of the mightiest thunder,” speaks to the inner man in the nineteenth
century of the Christian era, as it spoke in the corresponding
century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> It is a useless and unprofitable task to offer to humanity
the choice between a future life and annihilation. The only chance that
remains for those friends of human progress who seek to establish for
the good of mankind a faith, henceforth stripped entirely of superstition

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
and dogmatic fetters is to address them in the words of Joshua: “Choose
ye this day whom you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers
served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the
Amorites, in whose land ye <span class="lock">dwell.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_33" id="FNanchor_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“The science of religion,” wrote Max Müller in 1860, “is only just
beginning.... During the last fifty years the authentic documents of
the most important religions in the world <em>have been recovered in a most
unexpected and almost miraculous</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>manner</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_34" id="FNanchor_34">[34]</a></span>
 We have now before us the
Canonical books of Buddhism; the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite> of Zoroaster is no
longer a sealed book; and the hymns of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> have revealed a
state of religions anterior to the first beginnings of that mythology which
in Homer and Hesiod stands before us as a mouldering <span class="lock">ruin.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_35" id="FNanchor_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>In their insatiable desire to extend the dominion of blind faith, the
early architects of Christian theology had been forced to conceal, as
much as it was possible, the true sources of the same. To this end
they are said to have burned or otherwise destroyed all the original manuscripts
on the <cite>Kabala</cite>, magic, and occult sciences upon which they
could lay their hands. They ignorantly supposed that the most dangerous
writings of this class had perished with the last Gnostic; but some
day they may discover their mistake. Other authentic and as important
documents will perhaps reäppear in a “most unexpected and almost
miraculous manner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
There are strange traditions current in various parts of the East—on
Mount Athos and in the Desert of Nitria, for instance—among
certain monks, and with learned Rabbis in Palestine, who pass their
lives in commenting upon the <cite>Talmud</cite>. They say that not all the rolls
and manuscripts, reported in history to have been burned by Cæsar, by
the Christian mob, in 389, and by the Arab General Amru, perished as
it is commonly believed; and the story they tell is the following: At
the time of the contest for the throne, in 51 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, between Cleopatra
and her brother Dionysius Ptolemy, the Bruckion, which contained over
seven hundred thousand rolls, all bound in wood and <em>fire-proof</em> parchment,
was undergoing repairs, and a great portion of the original manuscripts,
considered among the most precious, and which were not
duplicated, were stored away in the house of one of the librarians. As
the fire which consumed the rest was but the result of accident, no precautions
had been taken at the time. But they add, that several hours
passed between the burning of the fleet, set on fire by Cæsar’s order,
and the moment when the first buildings situated near the harbor caught
fire in their turn; and that all the librarians, aided by several hundred
slaves attached to the museum, succeeded in saving the most precious of
the rolls. So perfect and solid was the fabric of the parchment, that while
in some rolls the inner pages and the wood-binding were reduced to ashes,
of others the parchment binding remained unscorched. These particulars
were all written out in Greek, Latin, and the Chaldeo-Syriac dialect,
by a learned youth named Theodas, one of the scribes employed
in the museum. One of these manuscripts is alleged to be preserved
till now in a Greek convent; and the person who narrated the tradition
to us had seen it himself. He said that many more will see it and
learn where to look for important documents, when a certain prophecy
will be fulfilled; adding, that most of these works could be found in
Tartary and
 <span class="lock"> India.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_36" id="FNanchor_36">[36]</a></span>
 The monk showed us a copy of the original, which,
of course, we could read but poorly, as we claim but little erudition in
the matter of dead languages. But we were so particularly struck by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
the vivid and picturesque translation of the holy father, that we perfectly
remember some curious paragraphs, which run, as far as we can recall
them, as follows:—“When the Queen of the Sun (Cleopatra) was
brought back to the half-ruined city, after the fire had devoured the
<cite>Glory of the World</cite>; and when she saw the mountains of books—or
rolls—covering the half-consumed steps of the <i lang="it">estrada</i>; and when she
perceived that the inside was gone and the indestructible covers alone
remained, she wept in rage and fury, and cursed the meanness of her
fathers who had grudged the cost of the real Pergamos for the inside as
well as the outside of the precious rolls.” Further, our author, Theodas,
indulges in a joke at the expense of the queen for believing that nearly
all the library was burned; when, in fact, hundreds and thousands of the
choicest books were safely stored in his own house and those of other
scribes, librarians, students, and philosophers.</p>

<p>No more do sundry very learned Copts scattered all over the East
in Asia Minor, Egypt, and Palestine believe in the total destruction of
the subsequent libraries. For instance, they say that out of the library
of Attalus <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> of Pergamus, presented by Antony to Cleopatra, not a
volume was destroyed. At that time, according to their assertions, from
the moment that the Christians began to gain power in Alexandria—about
the end of the fourth century—and Anatolius, Bishop of Laodicea,
began to insult the national gods, the Pagan philosophers and learned
theurgists adopted effective measures to preserve the repositories of
their sacred learning. Theophilus, a bishop, who left behind him the
reputation of a most rascally and mercenary villain, was accused by one
named Antoninus, a famous theurgist and eminent scholar of occult
science of Alexandria, with bribing the slaves of the Serapion to steal
books which he sold to foreigners at great prices. History tells us how
Theophilus had the best of the philosophers, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 389; and how his
successor and nephew, the no less infamous Cyril, butchered Hypatia.
Suidas gives us some details about Antoninus, whom he calls Antonius,
and his eloquent friend Olympus, the defender of the Serapion.
But history is far from being complete in the miserable remnants of
books, which, crossing so many ages, have reached our own learned century;
it fails to give the facts relating to the first five centuries of Christianity
which are preserved in the numerous traditions current in the
East. Unauthenticated as these may appear, there is unquestionably
in the heap of chaff much good grain. That these traditions are not
oftener communicated to Europeans is not strange, when we consider
how apt our travellers are to render themselves antagonistic to the
natives by their skeptical bearing and, occasionally, dogmatic intolerance.
When exceptional men like some archæologists, who knew how

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
to win the confidence and even friendship of certain Arabs, are
favored with precious documents, it is declared simply a “coincidence.”
And yet there are widespread traditions of the existence of
certain subterranean, and immense galleries, in the neighborhood of
Ishmonia—the “petrified City,” in which are stored numberless manuscripts
and rolls. For no amount of money would the Arabs go near
it. At night, they say, from the crevices of the desolate ruins, sunk
deep in the unwatered sands of the desert, stream the rays from lights
carried to and fro in the galleries by no human hands. The Afrites
study the literature of the antediluvian ages, according to their belief,
and the Djin learns from the magic rolls the lesson of the following
day.</p>

<p>The <cite>Encyclopedia Britannica</cite>, in its article on Alexandria, says:
“When the temple of Serapis was demolished ... the valuable library
was <em>pillaged</em> or destroyed; and <em>twenty</em> years
 <span class="lock"> afterwards<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_37" id="FNanchor_37">[37]</a></span> the <em>empty shelves</em>
excited the regret ... etc.” But it does not state the subsequent fate of
the <em>pillaged</em> books.</p>

<p>In rivalry of the fierce Mary-worshippers of the fourth century, the
modern clerical persecutors of liberalism and “heresy” would willingly
shut up all the heretics and their books in some modern Serapion and
burn them
 <span class="lock"> alive.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_38" id="FNanchor_38">[38]</a></span>
 The cause of this hatred is natural. Modern research
has more than ever unveiled the secret. “Is not the worship of
saints and angels now,” said Bishop Newton, years ago, “in all respects
the same that the worship of demons was in former times? The name
only is different, the thing is identically the same ... the very same
temples, the very same images, which were once consecrated to Jupiter
and the other demons, are now consecrated to the Virgin Mary and
other saints ... the whole of Paganism is converted and applied <em>to
Popery</em>.”</p>

<p>Why not be impartial and add that “a good portion of it was adopted
by Protestant religions also?”</p>

<p>The very apostolic designation <i>Peter</i> is from the Mysteries. The
hierophant or supreme pontiff bore the Chaldean title פתר, <i>peter</i>, or interpreter.
The names Phtah, Peth’r, the residence of Balaam, Patara,
and Patras, the names of oracle-cities, <i lang="la">pateres</i> or <i lang="la">pateras</i> and, perhaps,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
Buddha,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_39" id="FNanchor_39">[39]</a>
 all come from the same root. Jesus says: “Upon this <i>petra</i> I
will build my Church, and the gates, or rulers of Hades, shall not prevail
against it;” meaning by <i>petra</i> the rock-temple, and by metaphor, the
Christian Mysteries; the adversaries to which were the old mystery-gods
of the underworld, who were worshipped in the rites of Isis, Adonis,
Atys, Sabazius, Dionysus, and the Eleusinia. No <em>apostle</em> Peter was ever
at Rome; but the Pope, seizing the sceptre of the <i lang="la">Pontifex Maximus</i>, the
keys of Janus and Kubelé, and adorning his Christian head with the cap
of the <i lang="la">Magna Mater</i>, copied from that of the tiara of Brahmâtma, the
Supreme Pontiff of the Initiates of old India, became the successor of
the Pagan high priest, the real Peter-Roma, or <span class="lock"><i>Petroma</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_40" id="FNanchor_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church has two far mightier enemies than the
“heretics” and the “infidels;” and these are—Comparative Mythology
and Philology. When such eminent divines as the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> James Freeman
Clarke go so much out of their way to prove to their readers that
“Critical Theology from the time of Origen and Jerome ... and the
Controversial Theology during fifteen centuries, has not consisted in
accepting on authority the opinions of other people,” but has shown,
on the contrary, much “acute and comprehensive reasoning,” we can but
regret that so much scholarship should have been wasted in attempting
to prove that which a fair survey of the history of theology upsets at
every step. In these “controversies” and critical treatment of the doctrines
of the Church one can certainly find any amount of “acute reasoning,”
but far more of a still acuter sophistry.</p>

<p>Recently the mass of cumulative evidence has been re-inforced to an
extent which leaves little, if any, room for further controversy. A conclusive
opinion is furnished by too many scholars to doubt the fact that
India was the <i lang="la">Alma-Mater</i>, not only of the civilization, arts, and sciences,
but also of all the great religions of antiquity; Judaism, and hence
Christianity, included. Herder places the cradle of humanity in India,
and shows Moses as a clever and relatively <em>modern</em> compiler of the ancient
Brahmanical traditions: “The river which encircles the country (India)
is the sacred Ganges, which all Asia considers as the paradisaical river.
There, also, is the biblical Gihon, which is none else but the Indus.
The Arabs call it so unto this day, and the names of the countries watered
by it are yet existing among the Hindus.” Jacolliot claims to have
translated every ancient palm-leaf manuscript which he had the fortune
of being allowed by the Brahmans of the pagodas to see. In one of his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
translations, we found passages which reveal to us the <em>undoubted origin
of the keys</em> of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, and account for the subsequent adoption of the
symbol by their Holinesses, the Popes of Rome.</p>

<p>He shows us, on the testimony of the <cite>Agrouchada Parikshai</cite>, which
he freely translates as “the <cite>Book of Spirits</cite>” (Pitris), that centuries
before our era the <em>initiates</em> of the temple chose a Superior Council, presided
over by the Brahm-âtma or supreme chief of all these <em>Initiates</em>.
That this pontificate, which could be exercised only by a Brahman who
had reached the age of eighty
 <span class="lock"> years;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_41" id="FNanchor_41">[41]</a></span>
 that the Brahm-âtma was sole
guardian of the mystic formula, <i lang="fr">résumé</i> of every science, contained in the
three mysterious letters,</p>

<p class="center sansserif">
<b>A</b><br>
<br>
<b>U</b><span class="ss" style="width:5em"> </span><b>M</b><br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">which signify <em>creation</em>, <em>conservation</em>, and <em>transformation</em>. He alone
could expound its meaning in the presence of the initiates of the third
and supreme degree. Whomsoever among these initiates revealed to a
profane a single one of the truths, even the smallest of the secrets entrusted
to his care, was put to death. He who received the confidence
had to share his fate.</p>

<p>“Finally, to crown this able system,” says Jacolliot, “there existed a
word still more superior to the mysterious monosyllable—A U M, and
which rendered him who came into the possession of its key nearly the
equal of Brahma himself. The Brahm-âtma alone possessed this key,
and transmitted it in a sealed casket to his successor.</p>

<p>“This unknown word, of which no human power could, even to-day,
when the Brahmanical authority has been crushed under the Mongolian
and European invasions, to-day, when each pagoda has its Brahm-âtma,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_42" id="FNanchor_42">[42]</a>
<em>force the disclosure</em>, was engraved in a golden triangle and preserved in
a sanctuary of the temple of Asgartha, whose Brahm-âtma alone held the
keys. He also bore upon his tiara <em>two crossed keys</em> supported by two
kneeling Brahmans, symbol of the precious deposit of which he had the
keeping.... This word and this triangle were engraved upon the tablet
of the ring that this religious chief wore as one of the signs of his dignity;
it was also framed in a golden sun on the altar, where every morning
the Supreme Pontiff offered the sacrifice of the sarvameda, or sacrifice
to all the forces of <span class="lock">nature.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_43" id="FNanchor_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Is this clear enough? And will the Catholics still maintain that it
was the Brahmans of 4,000 years ago who copied the ritual, symbols, and
dress of the Roman Pontiffs? We would not feel in the least surprised.</p>

<p>Without going very far back into antiquity for comparisons, if we only
stop at the fourth and fifth centuries of our era, and contrast the so-called
“heathenism” of the third Neo-platonic Eclectic School with the growing
Christianity, the result may not be favorable to the latter. Even at
that early period, when the new religion had hardly outlined its contradictory
dogmas; when the champions of the bloodthirsty Cyril knew not
themselves whether Mary was to become “the Mother of God,” or rank
as a “demon” in company with Isis; when the memory of the meek and
lowly Jesus still lingered lovingly in every Christian heart, and his words
of mercy and charity vibrated still in the air, even then the Christians
were outdoing the Pagans in every kind of ferocity and religious intolerance.</p>

<p>And if we look still farther back, and seek for examples of true
<em>Christism</em>, in ages when Buddhism had hardly superseded Brahmanism in
India, and the name of Jesus was only to be pronounced three centuries
later, what do we find? Which of the holy pillars of the Church has ever
elevated himself to the level of religious tolerance and noble simplicity
of character of some heathen? Compare, for instance, the Hindu
Asoka, who lived 300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the Carthaginian <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, who flourished
three centuries after Christ. According to Max Müller, this is
what is found engraved on the rocks of Girnar, Dhauli, and Kapurdigiri:</p>

<p>“Piyadasi, the king beloved of the gods, desires that the ascetics <em>of
all creeds</em> might reside in all places. All these ascetics profess alike the
command which people should exercise over themselves, and the purity
of the soul. <em>But people have different opinions and different inclinations.</em>”</p>

<p>And here is what Augustine wrote after his baptism: “Wondrous
depth of thy words! whose surface, behold! is before us, inviting to
little ones; yet are they a wondrous depth, O my God, a wondrous
depth! It is awful to look therein; yes ... an awfulness of honor,
and a trembling of love. Thy enemies [read Pagans] thereof I <em>hate</em>
vehemently; Oh, <em>that thou wouldst slay them</em> with thy two-edged sword,
that they might no longer be enemies to it; for <em>so do I love to have them</em>
<span class="lock"><em>slain</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_44" id="FNanchor_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Wonderful spirit of Christianity; and that from a Manichean converted
to the religion of one who even on his cross prayed for his enemies!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Who the enemies of the “Lord” were, according to the Christians, is
not difficult to surmise; the few inside the Augustinian fold were His new
children and favorites, who had supplanted in His affections the sons of
Israel, His “chosen people.” The rest of mankind were His natural foes.
The teeming multitudes of heathendom were proper food for the flames
of hell; the handful within the Church communion, “heirs of salvation.”</p>

<p>But if such a proscriptive policy was just, and its enforcement was
“sweet savor” in the nostrils of the “Lord,” why not scorn also the
Pagan rites and philosophy? Why draw so deep from the wells of wisdom,
dug and filled up to brim by the same heathen? Or did the fathers, in
their desire to imitate the chosen people whose time-worn shoes they
were trying to fit upon their feet, contemplate the reënaction of the
spoliation-scene of the <cite>Exodus</cite>? Did they propose, in fleeing from
heathendom as the Jews did from Egypt, to carry off the valuables of its
religious allegories, as the “chosen ones” did the gold and silver ornaments?</p>

<p>It certainly does seem as if the events of the first centuries of Christianity
were but the reflection of the images thrown upon the mirror of
the future at the time of the Exodus. During the stormy days of Irenæus,
the Platonic philosophy, with its mystical submersion into Deity, was not
so obnoxious after all to the new doctrine as to prevent the Christians
from helping themselves to its abstruse metaphysics in every way and
manner. Allying themselves with the ascetical theurapeutæ—forefathers
and models of the Christian monks and hermits, it was in Alexandria, let
it be remembered, that they laid the first foundations of the purely Platonic
trinitarian doctrine. It became the Plato-Philonean doctrine later,
and such as we find it now. Plato considered the divine nature under a
three-fold modification of the <em>First Cause</em>, the reason or <i>Logos</i>, and the
soul or spirit of the universe. “The three archial or original principles,”
says Gibbon,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_45" id="FNanchor_45">[45]</a> “were represented in the Platonic system as three gods,
united with each other by a mysterious and ineffable generation.” Blending
this transcendental idea with the more hypostatic figure of the <i>Logos</i>
of Philo, whose doctrine was that of the oldest Kabala, and who viewed

 <span class="lock"> Himself;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_46" id="FNanchor_46">[46]</a></span>
 the
Christians clothed with this mythical representation of the Mediator for
the fallen race of Adam, Jesus, the son of Mary. Under this unexpected
garb his personality was all but lost. In the modern Jesus of the Christian
Church, we find the ideal of the imaginative Irenæus, not the adept

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
of the Essenes, the obscure reformer from Galilee. We see him under
the disfigured Plato-Philonean mask, not as the disciples heard him on
the mount.</p>

<p>So far then the heathen philosophy had helped them in the building
of the principal dogma. But when the theurgists of the third Neo-platonic
school, deprived of their ancient Mysteries, strove to blend the
doctrines of Plato with those of Aristotle, and by combining the two
philosophies added to their theosophy the primeval doctrines of the
Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>, then the Christians from rivals became persecutors.
Once that the metaphysical allegories of Plato were being prepared to be
discussed in public in the form of Grecian dialectics, all the elaborate
system of the Christian trinity would be unravelled and the divine prestige
completely upset. The eclectic school, reversing the order, had
adopted the inductive method; and this method became its death-knell.
Of all things on earth, logic and reasonable explanations were the most
hateful to the new religion of mystery; for they threatened to unveil the
whole ground-work of the trinitarian conception; to apprise the multitude
of the doctrine of emanations, and thus destroy the unity of the
whole. It could not be permitted, and it was not. History records the
<em>Christ</em>-like means that were resorted to.</p>

<p>The universal doctrine of emanations, adopted from time immemorial
by the greatest schools which taught the kabalistic, Alexandrian, and
Oriental philosophers, gives the key to that panic among the Christian
fathers. That spirit of Jesuitism and clerical craft, which prompted
Parkhurst, many centuries later, to suppress in his <cite>Hebrew Lexicon</cite> the
true meaning of the first word of <cite>Genesis</cite>, originated in those days of
war against the expiring Neo-platonic and eclectic school. The fathers
had decided to pervert the meaning of the word
 <span class="lock"> “<i>daimon</i>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_47" id="FNanchor_47">[47]</a></span>
 and they
dreaded above all to have the esoteric and true meaning of the word
<i>Rasit</i> unveiled to the multitudes; for if once the true sense of this
sentence, as well as that of the Hebrew word <i>asdt</i> (translated in the
Septuagint “<i>angels</i>,” while it means
 <span class="lock"> emanations),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_48" id="FNanchor_48">[48]</a></span>
 were understood
rightly, the mystery of the Christian trinity would have crumbled, carrying
in its downfall the new religion into the same heap of ruins with the
ancient Mysteries. This is the true reason why dialecticians, as well as
Aristotle himself, the “prying philosopher,” were ever obnoxious to
Christian theology. Even Luther, while on his work of reform, feeling
the ground insecure under his feet, notwithstanding that the dogmas had

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
been reduced by him to their simplest expression, gave full vent to his
fear and hatred for Aristotle. The amount of abuse he heaped upon the
memory of the great logician can only be equalled—never surpassed—by
the Pope’s anathemas and invectives against the liberals of the Italian
government. Compiled together, they might easily fill a copy of a new
encyclopædia with models for monkish diatribes.</p>

<p>Of course the Christian clergy can never get reconciled with a doctrine
based on the application of strict logic to discursive reasoning.
The number of those who have abandoned theology on this account has
never been made known. They have asked questions and been forbidden
to ask them; hence, separation, disgust, and often a despairing
plunge into the abyss of atheism. The Orphean views of ether as chief
<em>medium between</em> God and created matter were likewise denounced. The
Orphic Æther recalled too vividly the <em>Archeus</em>, the Soul of the World,
and the latter was in its metaphysical sense as closely related to the
emanations, being the first manifestation—Sephira, or Divine Light.
And when could the latter be more feared than at that critical moment?</p>

<p>Origen, Clemens Alexandrinus, Chalcidius, Methodius, and Maimonides,
on the authority of the <em>Targum</em> of Jerusalem, the orthodox and
greatest authority of the Jews, held that the first two words in the book
of <cite>Genesis</cite>—<span class="allsmcap">B-RASIT</span>, mean <i>Wisdom</i>, or the <i>Principle</i>. And that the
idea of these words meaning “<em>in the beginning</em>” was never shared but
by the profane, who were not allowed to penetrate any deeper into the
esoteric sense of the sentence. Beausobre, and after him Godfrey Higgins,
have demonstrated the fact. “All things,” says the <cite>Kabala</cite>, “are
derived from one great Principle, and this principle is the <em>unknown</em> and
<em>invisible</em> God. From Him a substantial power immediately proceeds,
which is the <em>image of God</em>, and the source of all subsequent emanations.
This second principle sends forth, by the <em>energy</em> (or <em>will</em> and <em>force</em>) of
emanation, other natures, which are more or less perfect, according to
their different degrees of distance, in the scale of emanation, from the
First Source of existence, and which constitute different worlds, or orders
of being, all united to the eternal power from which they proceed.
<em>Matter is nothing more than the most remote effect of the emanative energy</em>
of the Deity. The material world receives its form from the immediate
agency of powers far beneath the First Source of Being<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_49" id="FNanchor_49">[49]</a>.... Beausobre<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_50" id="FNanchor_50">[50]</a>
makes <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine the Manichean say thus: ‘And if by <i>Rasit</i> we
understand the <em>active Principle</em> of the creation, instead of its <em>beginning</em>,
in such a case we will clearly perceive that Moses never meant to say
<abbr title="History of Manichaeism - Beausobre"></abbr>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
that heaven and earth were the first works of God. He only said that
God created heaven and earth <em>through the Principle</em>, who is His Son. It
is not the <em>time</em> he points to, but to the immediate author of the creation.’
Angels, according to Augustine, were created <em>before</em> the firmament, and
according to the esoteric interpretation, the heaven and earth were created
after that, evolving from the <em>second</em> Principle or the Logos—the
creative Deity. “The word <i>principle</i>,” says Beausobre, “does not
mean that the heaven and earth were created before anything else, for,
to begin with, the <em>angels</em> were created before that; but that God did
everything through His Wisdom, which is His <i lang="la">Verbum</i>, and which the
Christian <cite>Bible</cite> named the <i>Beginning</i>,” thus adopting the exoteric meaning
of the word abandoned to the multitudes. The <cite>Kabala</cite>—the Oriental
as well as the Jewish—shows that a number of <em>emanations</em> (the
Jewish Sephiroth) issued from the <em>First</em> Principle, the chief of which
was <em>Wisdom</em>. This Wisdom is the Logos of Philo, and Michael, the
chief of the Gnostic Eons; it is the Ormazd of the Persians; <i>Minerva</i>,
goddess of wisdom, of the Greeks, who emanated from the head of
Jupiter; and the second Person of the Christian Trinity. The early
Fathers of the Church had not much to exert their imagination; they
found a ready-made doctrine that had existed in every theogony for thousands
of years before the Christian era. Their trinity is but the trio of
Sephiroth, the first three kabalistic <em>lights</em> of which Moses Nachmanides
says, that “<em>they have never been seen by any one</em>; there is not any defect
in them, nor any disunion.” The first eternal number is the Father, or
the Chaldean primeval, invisible, and incomprehensible <em>chaos</em>, out of
which proceeded the <em>Intelligible</em> one. The Egyptian Phtah, or “the
<i>Principle of Light</i>—not the light itself, and the Principle of Life,
though himself <em>no</em> life.” The <em>Wisdom</em> by which the Father created the
heavens is the <em>Son</em>, or the kabalistic androgynous Adam Kadmon.
The Son is at once the male <em>Ra</em>, or Light of Wisdom, Prudence or <em>Intelligence</em>,
Sephira, the female part of Himself; while from this dual being
proceeds the third emanation, the Binah or Reason, the second Intelligence—the
Holy Ghost of the Christians. Therefore, strictly speaking,
there is a <span class="smcap">Tetraktis</span> or quaternary, consisting of the Unintelligible
First monad, and its triple emanation, which properly constitute our
Trinity.</p>

<p>How then avoid perceiving at once, that had not the Christians purposely
disfigured in their interpretation and translation the Mosaic <cite>Genesis</cite>
to fit their own views, their religion, with its present dogmas, would have
been impossible? The word Rasit, once taught in its new sense of the
<em>Principle</em> and not the <em>Beginning</em>, and the anathematized doctrine of
emanations accepted, the position of the second trinitarian personage

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
becomes untenable. For, if the angels are the <em>first</em> divine emanations
from the Divine Substance, and were in existence <em>before</em> the Second
Principle, then the anthropomorphized <em>Son</em> is at best an emanation like
themselves, and cannot be God <em>hypostatically</em> any more than our visible
works are ourselves. That these metaphysical subtleties never entered
into the head of the honest-minded, sincere Paul, is evident; as it is furthermore
evident, that like all learned Jews he was well acquainted with
the doctrine of emanations and never thought of corrupting it. How
can any one imagine that Paul identified the <em>Son</em> with the <em>Father</em>, when
he tells us that God made Jesus “a <em>little lower</em> than the angels”
(<cite>Hebrews</cite> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 9), and a <em>little higher</em> than Moses! “For this <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span> was
counted worthy of more glory than Moses” (<cite>Hebrews</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 3). Of whatever,
or how many forgeries, interlined later in the <cite>Acts</cite>, the Fathers are
guilty we know not; but that Paul never considered Christ more than
a man “full of the Spirit of God” is but too evident: “In the <em>arche</em>
was the <i>Logos</i>, and the Logos was adnate to the Theos.”</p>

<p><em>Wisdom</em>, the first emanation of En-Soph; the Protogonos, the Hypostasis;
the Adam Kadmon of the kabalist, the Brahma of the Hindu;
the Logos of Plato, and the “<em>Beginning</em>” of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John—is the Rasit—ראשית,
of the <cite>Book of Genesis</cite>. If rightly interpreted it overturns, as we
have remarked, the whole elaborate system of Christian theology, for
it proves that behind the <em>creative</em> Deity, there was a
<span class="allsmcap">HIGHER</span> god; a
planner, an architect; and that the former was but His executive agent—a
simple <span class="allsmcap">POWER</span>!</p>

<p>They persecuted the Gnostics, murdered the philosophers, and burned
the kabalists and the masons; and when the day of the great reckoning
arrives, and the light shines in darkness, what will they have to offer in
the place of the departed, expired religion? What will they answer,
these pretended monotheists, these worshippers and <em>pseudo</em>-servants of
the one living God, to their Creator? How will they account for this
long persecution of them who were the true followers of the grand
Megalistor, the supreme great master of the Rosicrucians, the <span class="allsmcap">FIRST</span>
of masons. “For he is the Builder and Architect of the Temple of the
universe; He is the <i lang="la">Verbum Sapienti</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_51" id="FNanchor_51">[51]</a></p>

<p>“Every one knows,” wrote the great Manichean of the third century,
Fauste, “that the Evangeliums were written neither by Jesus Christ,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
nor his apostles, but long after their time by some unknown persons,
who, judging well that they would hardly be believed when telling of
things they had not seen themselves, headed their narratives with the
names of the apostles or of disciples contemporaneous with the latter.”</p>

<p>Commenting upon the subject, A. Franck, the learned Hebrew
scholar of the Institute and translator of the <cite>Kabala</cite>, expresses the same
idea. “Are we not authorized,” he asks, “to view the <cite>Kabala</cite> as a
precious remnant of religious philosophy of the Orient, which, transported
into Alexandria, got mixed to the doctrine of Plato, and under the
usurped name of Dionysius the Areopagite, bishop of Athens, converted
and consecrated by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, was thus enabled to penetrate into the
mysticism of the mediæval <span class="lock">ages?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_52" id="FNanchor_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Says Jacolliot: “What is then this religious philosophy of the Orient,
which has penetrated into the mystic symbolism of Christianity? We
answer: This philosophy, the traces of which we find among the Magians,
the Chaldeans, the Egyptians, the Hebrew kabalists and the Christians,
is none other than that of the Hindu Brahmans, the sectarians of
the <em>pitris</em>, or the spirits of the invisible worlds which surround
 <span class="lock">us.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_53" id="FNanchor_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>But if the Gnostics were destroyed, the <cite>Gnosis</cite>, based on the secret
science of sciences, still lives. It is the earth which helps the woman,
and which is destined to open her mouth to swallow up mediæval Christianity,
the usurper and assassin of the great master’s doctrine. The
ancient <cite>Kabala</cite>, the Gnosis, or traditional <em>secret</em> knowledge, was never
without its representatives in any age or country. The trinities of initiates,
whether passed into history or concealed under the impenetrable veil of
mystery, are preserved and impressed throughout the ages. They are
known as Moses, Aholiab, and Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur,
as Plato, Philo, and Pythagoras, etc. At the Transfiguration we see them
as Jesus, Moses, and Elias, the three Trismegisti; and three kabalists,
Peter, James, and John—whose <em>revelation</em> is the key to all wisdom. We
found them in the twilight of Jewish history as Zoroaster, Abraham, and
Terah, and later as Henoch, Ezekiel, and Daniel.</p>

<p>Who, of those who ever studied the ancient philosophies, who understand
intuitionally the grandeur of their conceptions, the boundless sublimity
of their views of the Unknown Deity, can hesitate for a moment to
give the preference to their doctrines over the incomprehensible dogmatic
and contradictory theology of the hundreds of Christian sects?
Who that ever read Plato and fathomed his Το Ὀν, “<cite>whom no person has
seen except the Son</cite>,” can doubt that Jesus was a disciple of the same

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
secret doctrine which had instructed the great philosopher? For, as we
have shown before now, Plato never claimed to be the inventor of all
that he wrote, but gave credit for it to Pythagoras, who, in his turn,
pointed to the remote East as the source whence he derived his information
and his philosophy. Colebrooke shows that Plato confesses it in his
epistles, and says that he has taken his teachings from ancient and sacred
 <span class="lock">doctrines!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_54" id="FNanchor_54">[54]</a></span>
 Moreover, it is undeniable that the theologies of all the
great nations dovetail together and show that each is a part of “one
stupendous whole.” Like the rest of the initiates we see Plato taking
great pains to conceal the true meaning of his allegories. Every time
the subject touches the greater secrets of the Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>, secret of
the true cosmogony of the universe and of the <em>ideal</em>, preëxisting world,
Plato shrouds his philosophy in the profoundest darkness. His <cite>Timæus</cite>
is so confused that no one but an <em>initiate</em> can understand the secret
meaning. And Mosheim thinks that Philo has filled his works with passages
directly contradicting each other for the sole purpose of concealing
the true doctrine. For once we see a critic on the right track.</p>

<p>And this very trinitarian idea, as well as the so bitterly denounced
doctrine of emanations, whence their remotest origin? The answer is
easy, and every proof is now at hand. In the sublime and profoundest
of all philosophies, that of the universal “Wisdom-Religion,” the first
traces of which, historical research now finds in the old pre-Vedic
religion of India. As the much-abused Jacolliot well remarks, “It is not
in the religious works of antiquity, such as the <cite>Vedas</cite>, the <cite>Zend Avesta</cite>,
the <cite>Bible</cite>, that we have to search for the exact expression of the ennobling
and sublime beliefs of those
 <span class="lock">epochs.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_55" id="FNanchor_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>“The holy primitive syllable, composed of the three letters
A—U—M., in which is contained the Vedic Trimurti (Trinity), must
be kept secret, like another triple Veda,” says Manu, in book <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>, sloka
265.</p>

<p>Swayambhouva is the unrevealed Deity; it is the Being existent
through and of itself; he is the central and immortal germ of all that
exists in the universe. Three trinities emanate and are confounded in
him, forming a Supreme <em>unity</em>. These trinities, or the triple <em>Trimurti</em>,
are: the Nara, Nari, and Viradyi—the <em>initial</em> triad; the Agni, Vaya, and
Sourya—the <em>manifested</em> triad; Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva, the <em>creative</em> triad.
Each of these triads becomes less metaphysical and more adapted to
the vulgar intelligence as it descends. Thus the last becomes but the
symbol in its concrete expression; the necessarianism of a purely metaphysical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
conception. Together with Swayambhouva, they are the ten
<em>Sephiroth</em> of the Hebrew kabalists, the ten Hindu Pragâpatis—the
En-Soph of the former, answering to the great <em>Unknown</em>, expressed by
the mystic A U M of the latter.</p>

<p>Says Franck, the translator of the <cite>Kabala</cite>:</p>

<p>“The ten Sephiroth are divided into <em>three classes</em>, each of them
presenting to us the divinity <em>under a different aspect</em>, the whole still
remaining an <em>indivisible Trinity</em>.</p>

<p>“The first three Sephiroth are purely intellectual in metaphysics,
they express the absolute identity of existence and thought, and form
what the modern kabalists called the intelligible world—which is the
first manifestation of God.</p>

<p>“The three that follow, make us conceive God in one of their
aspects, as the identity of goodness and wisdom; in the other they show
to us, in the Supreme good, the origin of beauty and magnificence (in
the creation). Therefore, they are named the <em>virtues</em>, or the <em>sensible
world</em>.</p>

<p>“Finally, we learn, by the last three Sephiroth, that the Universal
Providence, that the Supreme artist is also <em>absolute Force</em>, the all-powerful
cause, and that, at the same time, this cause <em>is the generative
element of all that is</em>. It is these last Sephiroth that constitute the
<em>natural world</em>, or nature in its essence and in its <em>active</em> principle,
<i lang="la">Natura naturans.</i>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_56" id="FNanchor_56">[56]</a></p>

<p>This kabalistic conception is thus proved identical with that of the
Hindu philosophy. Whoever reads Plato and his <cite>Dialogue</cite> Timæus,
will find these ideas as faithfully re-echoed by the Greek philosopher.
Moreover, the injunction of secrecy was as strict with the kabalists, as
with the initiates of the Adyta and the Hindu Yogis.</p>

<p>“Close thy mouth, lest thou shouldst speak of <em>this</em> (the mystery),
and thy heart, lest thou shouldst think aloud; and if thy heart has escaped
thee, bring it back to its place, for such is the object of our alliance”
(<cite>Sepher Jezireh</cite>, <cite>Book of Creation</cite>).</p>

<p>“This is a secret which gives death: close thy mouth lest thou
shouldst reveal to the vulgar; compress thy brain lest something should
escape from it and fall outside” (<cite>Agrouchada-Parikshai</cite>).</p>

<p>Truly the fate of many a future generation hung on a gossamer thread,
in the days of the third and fourth centuries. Had not the Emperor
sent in 389 to Alexandria a rescript—which was forced from him by the
Christians—for the destruction of every idol, our own century would
never have had a Christian mythological Pantheon of its own. Never

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
did the Neo-platonic school reach such a height of philosophy as when
nearest its end. Uniting the mystic theosophy of old Egypt with the
refined philosophy of the Greeks; nearer to the ancient Mysteries of
Thebes and Memphis than they had been for centuries; versed in the
science of soothsaying and divination, as in the art of the Therapeutists;
friendly with the acutest men of the Jewish nation, who were deeply
imbued with the Zoroastrian ideas, the Neo-platonists tended to amalgamate
the old wisdom of the Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite> with the more refined
conceptions of the Occidental Theosophists. Notwithstanding the
treason of the Christians, who saw fit, for political reasons, after the days
of Constantine, to repudiate their tutors, the influence of the new
Platonic philosophy is conspicuous in the subsequent adoption of
dogmas, the origin of which can be traced but too easily to that remarkable
school. Though mutilated and disfigured, they still preserve a
strong family likeness, which nothing can obliterate.</p>

<p>But, if the knowledge of the occult powers of nature opens the
spiritual sight of man, enlarges his intellectual faculties, and leads him
unerringly to a profounder veneration for the Creator, on the other hand
ignorance, dogmatic narrow-mindedness, and a childish fear of looking to
the bottom of things, invariably leads to fetish-worship and superstition.</p>

<p>When Cyril, the Bishop of Alexandria, had openly embraced the
cause of Isis, the Egyptian goddess, and had anthropomorphized her into
Mary, the mother of God; and the trinitarian controversy had taken
place; from that moment the Egyptian doctrine of the emanation of the
creative God out of Emepht began to be tortured in a thousand ways,
until the Councils had agreed upon the adoption of it as it now stands—the
disfigured Ternary of the kabalistic Solomon and Philo! But as
its origin was yet too evident, the <em>Word</em> was no longer called the
“Heavenly man,” the <em>primal</em> Adam Kadmon, but became the Logos—Christ,
and was made as old as the “Ancient of the Ancient,” his
father. The <em>concealed</em> WISDOM became identical with its emanation,
the <span class="smcap">Divine Thought</span>, and made to be regarded coëqual and coëternal
with its first manifestation.</p>

<p>If we now stop to consider another of the fundamental dogmas of
Christianity, the doctrine of atonement, we may trace it as easily back to
heathendom. This corner-stone of a Church which had believed herself
built on a firm rock for long centuries, is now excavated by science and
proved to come from the Gnostics. Professor Draper shows it as hardly
known in the days of Tertullian, and as having “<em>originated</em> among the
Gnostic
 <span class="lock"> heretics.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_57" id="FNanchor_57">[57]</a></span>
 We will not permit ourselves to contradict such a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
learned authority, farther than to state that it <em>originated</em> among them
no more than their “anointed” Christos and Sophia. The former
they modelled on the original of the “King Messiah,” the male principle
of wisdom, and the latter on the third Sephiroth, from the Chaldean
<cite>Kabala</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_58" id="FNanchor_58">[58]</a>
 and even from the Hindu Brahma and Sara-âsvati,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_59" id="FNanchor_59">[59]</a>
    and the
Pagan Dionysus and Demeter. And here we are on firm ground, if it
were only because it is now proved that the <cite>New Testament</cite> never
appeared in its complete form, such as we find it now, till 300 years
after the period of apostles,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_60" id="FNanchor_60">[60]</a>
 and the <cite>Sohar</cite> and other kabalistic books
are found to belong to the first century before our era, if not to be far
older still.</p>

<p>The Gnostics entertained many of the Essenean ideas; and the
Essenes had their “greater” and “minor” Mysteries at least two centuries
before our era. They were the <i>Isarim</i> or <i>Initiates</i>, the descendants
of the Egyptian hierophants, in whose country they had been settled for
several centuries before they were converted to Buddhistic monasticism by
the missionaries of King Asoka, and amalgamated later with the earliest
Christians; and they existed, probably, before the old Egyptian temples
were desecrated and ruined in the incessant invasions of Persians, Greeks,
and other conquering hordes. The hierophants had their <em>atonement</em>
enacted in the Mystery of Initiation ages before the Gnostics, or even
the Essenes, had appeared. It was known among hierophants as the <span class="smcap">Baptism
of Blood</span>, and was considered not as an atonement for the “fall of
man” in Eden, but simply as an expiation for the past, present, and future
sins of ignorant but nevertheless polluted mankind. The hierophant
had the option of either offering his pure and sinless life as a sacrifice for
his race to the gods whom he hoped to rejoin, or an animal victim. The
former depended entirely on their own will. At the last moment of the
solemn “new birth,” the initiator passed “the word” to the initiated, and
immediately after that the latter had a weapon placed in his right hand,
and was ordered <em>to</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>strike</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_61" id="FNanchor_61">[61]</a></span>
 This is the true origin of the Christian dogma
of atonement.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Verily the “Christs” of the pre-Christian ages were many. But they
died unknown to the world, and disappeared as silently and as mysteriously
from the sight of man as Moses from the top of Pisgah, the mountain
of Nebo (oracular wisdom), after he had laid his hands upon Joshua,
who thus became “full of the spirit of wisdom” (<i>i.e.</i>, <em>initiated</em>).</p>

<p>Nor does the Mystery of the Eucharist pertain to Christians alone.
Godfrey Higgins proves that it was instituted many hundreds of years
before the “Paschal Supper,” and says that “the sacrifice of bread and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
wine was common to many ancient
 <span class="lock">nations.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_62" id="FNanchor_62">[62]</a></span>
 Cicero mentions it in his
works, and wonders at the strangeness of the rite. There had been an
esoteric meaning attached to it from the first establishment of the Mysteries,
and the Eucharistia is one of the oldest rites of antiquity. With
the hierophants it had nearly the same significance as with the Christians.
Ceres was <em>bread</em>, and Bacchus was <em>wine</em>; the former meaning regeneration
of life from the seed, and the latter—the grape—the emblem
of wisdom and knowledge; the accumulation of the spirit of things, and
the fermentation and subsequent strength of that esoteric knowledge
being justly symbolized by wine. The mystery related to the drama of
Eden; it is said to have been first taught by Janus, who was also the first
to introduce in the temples the sacrifices of “bread” and “wine” in commemoration
of the “fall into generation” as the symbol of the “seed.”
“I am the vine, and my Father is the husbandman,” says Jesus, alluding
to the secret knowledge that could be imparted by him. “I will drink
no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the
kingdom of God.”</p>

<p>The festival of the Eleusinian Mysteries began in the month of Boëdromion,
which corresponds with the month of September, the time of
grape-gathering, and lasted from the 15th to the
 <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of the month, <em>seven</em>
days.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_63" id="FNanchor_63">[63]</a>
 The Hebrew festival of the Feast of Tabernacles began on the
15th and ended on the <abbr title="twenty-second">22d</abbr> of the
 month of Ethanim, which Dunlap
shows as derived from Adonim, Adonia, Attenim,
 <span class="lock">Ethanim;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_64" id="FNanchor_64">[64]</a></span>
 and this
feast is named in <cite>Exodus</cite> (<abbr title="twenty-three">xxiii.</abbr> 16)
 the feast of <em>ingatherings</em>. “All the
men of Israel assembled unto King Solomon at the feast in the month
Ethanim, which is the <span class="lock"><em>seventh</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_65" id="FNanchor_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Plutarch thinks the feast of the booths to be the Bacchic rites, not

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the Eleusinian. Thus “Bacchus was directly called upon,” he says.
The <i>Sabazian</i> worship was <i>Sabbatic</i>; the names Evius, or Hevius, and
Luaios are identical with <i>Hivite</i> and <i>Levite</i>. The French name Louis
is the Hebrew <i>Levi</i>; Iacchus again is Iao or Jehovah; and Baal or Adon,
like Bacchus, was a phallic god. “Who shall ascend into the hill (the
high place) of the Lord?” asks the holy king David, “who shall stand in
the place of his <i>Kadushu</i> קדשו”? (<cite>Psalms</cite> <abbr title="twenty-four">xxiv.</abbr> 3). Kadesh may mean in
one sense to <i>devote, hallow, sanctify</i>, and even to initiate or to set apart;
but it also means the ministers of lascivious rites (the Venus-worship)
and the true interpretation of the word Kadesh is bluntly rendered in
<cite>Deuteronomy</cite> <abbr title="twenty-three">xxiii</abbr>. 17; <cite>Hosea</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 14; and <cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="thirty-eight">xxxviii.</abbr>, from verses
15 to 22. The “holy” Kadeshuth of the <cite>Bible</cite> were identical as to the
duties of their office with the Nautch-girls of the later Hindu pagodas.
The Hebrew <i>Kadeshim</i> or galli lived “by the house of the Lord, where
the women wove hangings for the grove,” or bust of Venus-Astartè, says
verse the seventh in the twenty-third chapter of 2 Kings.</p>

<p>The dance performed by David round the ark was the “circle-dance”
said to have been prescribed by the Amazons for the Mysteries. Such
was the dance of the daughters of Shiloh (<cite>Judges</cite> <abbr title="twenty-one">xxi.</abbr> 21, 23 <i>et passim</i>),
and the leaping of the prophets of Baal (<cite>1 Kings</cite> <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 26). It was simply
a characteristic of the Sabean worship, for it denoted the motion of the
planets round the sun. That the dance was a Bacchic frenzy is apparent.
Sistra were used on the occasion, and the taunt of Michael and the
king’s reply are very expressive. “The king of Israel uncovered himself
before his maid-servants as one of the <em>vain</em> (or debauched) fellows
shamelessly uncovereth himself.” And he retorts: “I will play (act
wantonly) before יהוה, and I will be yet more vile than this, and I will
be base in my own sight.” When we remember that David had sojourned
among the Tyrians and Philistines, where their rites were common;
and that indeed he had conquered that land away from the house
of Saul, by the aid of mercenaries from their country, the countenancing
and even, perhaps, the introduction of such a Pagan-like worship by the
weak “psalmist” seems very natural. David knew nothing of Moses, it
seems, and if he introduced the Jehovah-worship it was not in its monotheistic
character, but simply as that of one of the many gods of the
neighboring nations—a tutelary deity to whom he had given the preference,
and chosen among “all other gods.”</p>

<p>Following the Christian dogmas seriatim, if we concentrate our attention
upon one which provoked the fiercest battles until its recognition,
that of the Trinity, what do we find? We meet it, as we have shown,
northeast of the Indus; and tracing it to Asia Minor and Europe, recognize
it among every people who had anything like an established religion.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
It was taught in the oldest Chaldean, Egyptian, and Mithraïtic
schools. The Chaldean Sun-god, Mithra, was called “Triple,” and the
trinitarian idea of the Chaldeans was a doctrine of the Akkadians, who,
themselves, belonged to a race which was the first to conceive a metaphysical
trinity. The Chaldeans are a tribe of the Akkadians, according
to Rawlinson, who lived in Babylonia from the earliest times. They were
Turanians, according to others, and instructed the Babylonians into the
first notions of religion. But these same Akkadians, who were they?
Those scientists who would ascribe to them a Turanian origin, make
of them the inventors of the cuneiform characters; others call them Sumerians;
others again, respectively, make their language, of which (for
very good reasons) no traces whatever remain—Kasdean, Chaldaic,
Proto-Chaldean, Kasdo-Scythic, and so on. The only tradition worthy
of credence is that these Akkadians instructed the Babylonians in the
Mysteries, and taught them the sacerdotal or <em>Mystery</em>-language. These
Akkadians were then simply a tribe of the Hindu-Brahmans, now called
Aryans—their vernacular language, the
 <span class="lock"> Sanscrit<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_66" id="FNanchor_66">[66]</a></span>
 of the Vedas; and the
sacred or Mystery-language, that which, even in our own age, is used by
the Hindu fakirs and initiated Brahmans in their magical evocations.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_67" id="FNanchor_67">[67]</a>
It has been, from time immemorial, and still is employed by the initiates
of all countries, and the Thibetan lamas claim that it is in this tongue
that appear the mysterious characters on the leaves and bark of the
sacred Koumboum.</p>

<p>Jacolliot, who took such pains to penetrate the mysteries of the
Brahmanical initiation in translating and commenting upon the <cite>Agrouchada-Parikshai</cite>,
confesses the following:</p>

<p>“It is pretended also, without our being able to verify the assertion,
that the magical evocations were pronounced in a particular language,
and that it was forbidden, under pain of death, to translate them into
vulgar dialects. The rare expressions that we have been able to catch
like—<i>L’rhom</i>, <i>h’hom</i>, <i>sh’hrum</i>, <i>sho’rhim</i>, are in fact most curious, and do
not seem to belong to any known <span class="lock">idiom.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_68" id="FNanchor_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Those who have seen a fakir or a lama reciting his mantras and conjurations,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
know that he never pronounces the words audibly when preparing
for a phenomenon. His lips move, and none will ever hear the
terrible formula pronounced, except in the interior of the temples, and
then in a cautious whisper. This, then, was the language now respectively
baptized by every scientist, and, according to his imaginative and
philological propensities, Kasdeo-Semitic, Scythic, Proto-Chaldean, and
the like.</p>

<p>Scarcely two of even the most learned Sanscrit philologists are agreed
as to the true interpretation of Vedic words. Let one put forth an essay,
a lecture, a treatise, a translation, a dictionary, and straightway all the
others fall to quarrelling with each other and with him as to his sins of
omission and commission. Professor Whitney, greatest of American
Orientalists, says that Professor Müller’s notes on the <cite>Rig Veda Sânhita</cite>
“are far from showing that sound and thoughtful judgment, that moderation
and economy which are among the most precious qualities of an
exegete.” Professor Müller angrily retorts upon his critics that “not
only is the joy embittered which is the inherent reward of all <i lang="la">bona fide</i>
work, but selfishness, malignity, aye, <em>even untruthfulness</em>, gain the upper
hand, and the healthy growth of science is stunted.” He differs “in
many cases from the explanations of Vedic words given by Professor
Roth” in his <cite>Sanscrit Dictionary</cite>, and Professor Whitney shampooes
both their heads by saying that there are, unquestionably, words and
phrases “as to which both alike will hereafter be set right.”</p>

<p>In volume <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> of his <cite>Chips</cite>,
 Professor Müller stigmatizes all the <cite>Vedas</cite>
except the <cite>Rik</cite>, the <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite> included, as “theological twaddle,”
while Professor Whitney regards the latter as “the most comprehensive
and valuable of the four collections, next after the <cite>Rik</cite>.” To return to
the case of Jacolliot. Professor Whitney brands him as a “bungler
and a humbug,” and, as we remarked above, this is the very general
verdict. But when the <cite lang="fr">Bible dans l’Inde</cite> appeared, the Société Académique
de Saint Quentin requested M. Textor de Ravisi, a learned Indianist,
ten years Governor of Karikal, India, to report upon its merits.
He was an ardent Catholic, and bitterly opposed Jacolliot’s conclusions
where they discredited the Mosaic and Catholic revelations; but he was
forced to say: “Written with good faith, in an easy, vigorous, and passionate
style, of an easy and varied argumentation, the work of M. Jacolliot
is of absorbing interest ... a learned work on known facts and
with familiar arguments.”</p>

<p>Enough. Let Jacolliot have the benefit of the doubt when such
very imposing authorities are doing their best to show up each other as
incompetents and literary journeymen. We quite agree with Professor
Whitney that “the truism, that [for European critics?] it is far easier to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
pull to pieces than to build up, is nowhere truer than in matters affecting
the archæology and history of <span class="lock">India.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_69" id="FNanchor_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Babylonia happened to be situated on the way of the great stream of
the earliest Hindu emigration, and the Babylonians were one of the first
peoples benefited
 <span class="lock"> thereby.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_70" id="FNanchor_70">[70]</a></span>
 These Khaldi were the worshippers of the
Moon-god, Deus Lunus, from which fact we may infer that the Akkadians—if
such must be their name—belonged to the race of the Kings of the
Moon, whom tradition shows as having reigned in Pruyay—now Allahabad.
With them the trinity of Deus Lunus was manifested in the three
lunar phases, completing the quaternary with the fourth, and typifying
the death of the Moon-god in its gradual waning and final disappearance.
This death was allegorized by them, and attributed to the triumph of the
genius of evil over the light-giving deity; as the later nations allegorized
the death of their Sun-gods, Osiris and Apollo, at the hands of Typhon
and the great Dragon Python, when the sun entered the winter solstice.
Babel, Arach, and Akkad are names of the sun. The <cite>Zoroastrian
Oracles</cite> are full and explicit upon the subject of the Divine Triad. “A
triad of Deity shines forth throughout the whole world, of which a Monad
is the head,” admits the Reverend Dr. Maurice.</p>

<p>“For from this Triad, in the bosoms, are all things governed,” says
a Chaldean oracle. The Phos, Pur, and Phlox, of
 <span class="lock"> Sanchoniathon,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_71" id="FNanchor_71">[71]</a></span>
 are
Light, Fire, and Flame, three manifestations of the Sun who is <em>one</em>.
Bel-Saturn, Jupiter-Bel, and Bel or Baal-Chom are the Chaldean trinity;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_72" id="FNanchor_72">[72]</a>
The Babylonian Bel was regarded in the Triune aspect of Belitan,
Zeus-Belus (the mediator) and Baal-Chom who is Apollo Chomæus.
This was the Triune aspect of the ‘Highest God,’ who is, according to
Berosus, either El (the Hebrew), Bel, Belitan, Mithra, or Zervana, and
has the name πατηρ, “the Father.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_73" id="FNanchor_73">[73]</a>
The Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_74" id="FNanchor_74">[74]</a>
corresponding to Power, Wisdom, and Justice, which answer in their turn

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
to Spirit, Matter, Time, and the Past, Present, and Future, can be found
in the temple of Gharipuri; thousands of dogmatic Brahmans worship
these attributes of the Vedic Deity, while the severe monks and nuns
of Buddhistic Thibet recognize but the sacred trinity of the three cardinal
virtues: <em>Poverty</em>, <em>Chastity</em>, and <em>Obedience</em>, professed by the Christians,
practiced by the Buddhists and some Hindus alone.</p>

<p>The Persian triplicate Deity also consists of three persons, Ormazd,
Mithra, and Ahriman. “That is that principle,” says Porphyry,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_75" id="FNanchor_75">[75]</a> “which
the author of the <cite>Chaldaic Summary</cite> saith, ‘<cite>They conceive there is one
principle of all things, and declare that is one and good.</cite>’” The Chinese
idol Sanpao, consists of three equal in all
 <span class="lock"> respects;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_76" id="FNanchor_76">[76]</a></span>
 and the Peruvians
“supposed their Tanga-tanga to be one in three, and three in one,” says
 <span class="lock">Faber.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_77" id="FNanchor_77">[77]</a></span>
 The Egyptians have their Emepht, Eicton, and Phta; and the
triple god seated on the Lotos can be seen in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Petersburg Museum,
on a medal of the Northern Tartars.</p>

<p>Among the Church dogmas which have most seriously suffered of
late at the hands of the Orientalists, the last in question stands conspicuous.
The reputation of each of the three personages of the anthropomorphic
godhead as an original revelation to the Christians
through Divine will, has been badly compromised by inquiry into its
predecessors and origin. Orientalists have published more about the
similarity between Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Christianity than was
strictly agreeable to the Vatican. Draper’s assertion that “Paganism
was modified by Christianity, Christianity by
 <span class="lock">Paganism,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_78" id="FNanchor_78">[78]</a></span>
 is being daily
verified. “Olympus was restored but the divinities passed under other
names,” he says, treating of the Constantine period. “The more powerful
provinces insisted on the adoption of their time-honored conceptions.
Views of the trinity in accordance with the Egyptian traditions
were established. Not only was the adoration of Isis under a new name
restored, but even her image, standing on the crescent moon, reappeared.
The well-known effigy of that goddess with the infant Horus in her arms
has descended to our days, in the beautiful artistic creations of the
Madonna and child.”</p>

<p>But a still earlier origin than the Egyptian and Chaldean can be
assigned to the Virgin “Mother of God,” Queen of Heaven. Though

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Isis is also by right the Queen of Heaven, and is generally represented
carrying in her hand the Crux Ansata composed of the mundane cross,
and of the Stauros of the Gnostics, she is a great deal younger than the
celestial virgin, Neith. In one of the tombs of the Pharaohs—Rhameses,
in the valley of Biban-el-Molouk, in Thebes, Champollion, Junior,
discovered a picture, according to his opinion the most ancient ever yet
found. It represents the heavens symbolized by the figure of a woman
bedecked with stars. The birth of the Sun is figured by the form of a
little child, issuing from the bosom of its “Divine Mother.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Book of Hermes</cite>, “Pimander” is enunciated in distinct and unequivocal
sentences, the whole trinitarian dogma accepted by the Christians.
“The light is me,” says Pimander, the <span class="allsmcap">DIVINE THOUGHT</span>. “I
am the <i>nous</i> or intelligence, and I am thy god, and I am far older than
the human principle which escapes from the shadow. I am the germ of
thought, the resplendent <span class="allsmcap">WORD</span>, the <span class="allsmcap">SON</span> of God. Think that what thus
sees and hears in thee, is the <i lang="la">Verbum</i> of the Master, it is the Thought,
which is God the Father.... The celestial ocean, the <span class="smcap">Æther</span>, which
flows from east to west, is the Breath of the Father, the life-giving
Principle, the <span class="allsmcap">HOLY GHOST</span>!” “For they are not at all separated and
their union is <span class="allsmcap">LIFE</span>.”</p>

<p>Ancient as may be the origin of Hermes, lost in the unknown days of
Egyptian colonization, there is yet a far older prophecy, directly relating
to the Hindu Christna, according to the Brahmans. It is, to say the
least, strange that the Christians claim to base their religion upon a prophecy
of the <cite>Bible</cite>, which exists nowhere in that book. In what chapter
or verse does Jehovah, the “Lord God,” promise Adam and Eve to send
them a Redeemer who will save humanity? “I will put enmity between
thee and the woman,” says the Lord God to the serpent, “and between
thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his
heel.”</p>

<p>In these words there is not the slightest allusion to a Redeemer, and
the subtilest of intellects could not extract from them, as they stand in the
third chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite>, anything like that which the Christians have
contrived to find. On the other hand, in the traditions and <cite>Manu</cite>, Brahma
promises directly to the first couple to send them a Saviour who will
teach them the way to salvation.</p>

<p>“It is from the lips of a messenger of Brahma, who will be born in
Kuroukshetra, Matsya, and the land of Pantchola, also called Kanya-Cubja
(mountain of the Virgin), that all men on earth will learn their
duty,” says <cite>Manu</cite> (book <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, slokas 19 and 20).</p>

<p>The Mexicans call the Father of their Trinity Yzona, the Son Bacab,
and the Holy Ghost Echvah, “and say they received it (the doctrine)

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
from their
 <span class="lock">ancestors.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_79" id="FNanchor_79">[79]</a></span>
 Among the Semitic nations we can trace the trinity
to the prehistorical days of the fabled Sesostris, who is identified by
more than one critic with Nimrod, “the mighty hunter.” Manetho makes
the oracle rebuke the king, when the latter asks, “Tell me, O thou
strong in fire, who before me could subjugate all things? and who shall
after me?” And the oracle saith thus: “First God, then the Word,
and then ‘the <span class="lock">Spirit.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_80" id="FNanchor_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>In the foregoing lies the foundation of the fierce hatred of the Christians
toward the “Pagans” and the theurgists. Too much had been
<em>borrowed</em>; the ancient religions and the Neo-platonists had been laid by
them under contribution sufficiently to perplex the world for several
thousand years. Had not the ancient creeds been speedily obliterated,
it would have been found impossible to preach the Christian religion as a
New Dispensation, or the direct Revelation from God the Father, through
God the Son, and under the influence of God the Holy Ghost. As a
political exigence the Fathers had—to gratify the wishes of their rich
converts—instituted even the festivals of Pan. They went so far as to
accept the ceremonies hitherto celebrated by the Pagan world in honor
of the <em>God of the gardens</em>, in all their primitive
 <span class="lock"><em>sincerity</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_81" id="FNanchor_81">[81]</a></span>
 It was
time to sever the connection. Either the Pagan worship and the Neo-platonic
theurgy, with all ceremonial of magic, must be crushed out forever,
or the Christians become Neo-platonists.</p>

<p>The fierce polemics and single-handed battles between Irenæus and
the Gnostics are too well known to need repetition. They were carried on
for over two centuries after the unscrupulous Bishop of Lyons had uttered
his last religious paradox. Celsus, the Neo-platonist, and a disciple of
the school of Ammonius Saccas, had thrown the Christians into perturbation,
and even had arrested for a time the progress of proselytism by successfully
proving that the original and purer forms of the most important
dogmas of Christianity were to be found only in the teachings of Plato.
Celsus accused them of accepting the worst superstitions of Paganism, and
of interpolating passages from the books of the Sybils, without rightly
understanding their meaning. The accusations were so plausible, and the
facts so patent, that for a long time no Christian writer had ventured to
answer the challenge. Origen, at the fervent request of his friend, Ambrosius,
was the first to take the defense in hand, for, having belonged to
the same Platonic school of Ammonius, he was considered the most competent
man to refute the well-founded charges. But his eloquence failed,
and the only remedy that could be found was to destroy the writings of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Celsus
 <span class="lock">themselves.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_82" id="FNanchor_82">[82]</a></span>
 This could be achieved only in the fifth century,
when copies had been taken from this work, and many were those who
had read and studied them. If no copy of it has descended to our present
generation of scientists, it is not because there is none extant at
present, but for the simple reason that the monks of a certain Oriental
church on Mount Athos will neither show nor confess they have one in
their
 <span class="lock">possession.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_83" id="FNanchor_83">[83]</a></span>
 Perhaps they do not even know themselves the value
of the contents of their manuscripts, on account of their great ignorance.</p>

<p>The dispersion of the Eclectic school had become the fondest hope
of the Christians. It had been looked for and contemplated with intense
anxiety. It was finally achieved. The members were scattered by the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
hand of the monsters Theophilus, Bishop of Alexandria, and his nephew
Cyril—the murderer of the young, the learned, and the innocent
 <span class="lock">Hypatia!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_84" id="FNanchor_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>With the death of the martyred daughter of Theon, the mathematician,
there remained no possibility for the Neo-platonists to continue their
school at Alexandria. During the life-time of the youthful Hypatia her
friendship and influence with Orestes, the governor of the city, had assured
the philosophers security and protection against their murderous enemies.
With her death they had lost their strongest friend. How much she was
revered by all who knew her for her erudition, noble virtues, and character,
we can infer from the letters addressed to her by Synesius, Bishop of
Ptolemais, fragments of which have reached us. “My heart yearns for
the presence of your divine spirit,” he wrote in 413 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span>, “which more
than anything else could alleviate the bitterness of my fortunes.” At
another time he says: “Oh, my mother, my sister, my teacher, my benefactor!
My soul is very sad. The recollection of my children I have
lost is killing me.... When I have news of you and learn, as I hope,
that you are more fortunate than myself, I am at least only half-unhappy.”</p>

<p>What would have been the feelings of this most noble and worthy of
Christian bishops, who had surrendered family and children and happiness
for the faith into which he had been attracted, had a prophetic vision disclosed
to him that the only friend that had been left to him, his “mother,
sister, benefactor,” would soon become an unrecognizable mass of flesh
and blood, pounded to jelly under the blows of the club of Peter the
Reader—that her youthful, innocent body would be cut to pieces, “the
flesh scraped from the bones,” by oyster-shells and the rest of her cast
into the fire, by order of the same Bishop Cyril he knew so well—Cyril,
the <span class="allsmcap">CANONIZED</span> <span class="lock">Saint!!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_85" id="FNanchor_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>There has never been a religion in the annals of the world with such
a bloody record as Christianity. All the rest, including the traditional
fierce fights of the “chosen people” with their next of kin, the idolatrous
tribes of Israel, pale before the murderous fanaticism of the alleged followers
of Christ! Even the rapid spread of Mahometanism before the
conquering sword of the Islam prophet, is a direct consequence of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
bloody riots and fights among Christians. It was the intestine war between
the Nestorians and Cyrilians that engendered Islamism; and it is
in the convent of Bozrah that the prolific seed was first sown by Bahira,
the Nestorian monk. Freely watered by rivers of blood, the tree of
Mecca has grown till we find it in the present century overshadowing
nearly two hundred millions of people. The recent Bulgarian atrocities
are but the natural outgrowth of the triumph of Cyril and the Mariolaters.</p>

<p>The cruel, crafty politician, the plotting monk, glorified by ecclesiastical
history with the aureole of a martyred saint. The despoiled philosophers,
the Neo-platonists, and the Gnostics, daily anathematized by the
Church all over the world for long and dreary centuries. The curse of
the unconcerned Deity hourly invoked on the magian rites and theurgic
practice, and the Christian clergy themselves using <em>sorcery</em> for ages.
Hypatia, the glorious maiden-philosopher, torn to pieces by the Christian
mob. And such as Catherine de Medici, Lucrezia Borgia, Joanna of
Naples, and the Isabellas of Spain, presented to the world as the faithful
daughters of the Church—some even decorated by the Pope with the
order of the “Immaculate Rose,” the highest emblem of womanly purity
and virtue, a symbol sacred to the Virgin-mother of God! Such are the
examples of human justice! How far less blasphemous appears a total
rejection of Mary as an immaculate goddess, than an idolatrous worship
of her, accompanied by such practices.</p>

<p>In the next chapter we will present a few illustrations of sorcery, as
practiced under the patronage of the Roman Church.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> that famous work of Bodin, on
 <span class="lock">sorcery,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_86" id="FNanchor_86">[86]</a></span>
 a frightful story is told
about Catherine of Medicis. The author was a learned publicist,
who, during twenty years of his life, collected authentic documents from
the archives of nearly every important city of France, to make up a complete
work on sorcery, magic, and the power of various “demons.”
To use an expression of Eliphas Levi, his book offers a most remarkable
collection of “bloody and hideous facts; acts of revolting superstition,
arrests, and executions of stupid ferocity.” “Burn every body!” the
Inquisition seemed to say—God will easily sort out His own! Poor
fools, hysterical women, and idiots were roasted alive, without mercy, for
the crime of “magic.” But, “at the same time, how many great culprits
escaped this unjust and sanguinary <em>justice</em>! This is what Bodin makes
us fully appreciate.”</p>

<p>Catherine, the pious Christian—who has so well deserved in the eyes
of the Church of Christ for the atrocious and never-to-be-forgotten massacre
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew—the Queen Catherine, kept in her service an
apostate Jacobin priest. Well versed in the “black art,” so fully patronized
by the Medici family, he had won the gratitude and protection
of his pious mistress, by his unparalleled skill in killing people at a distance,
by torturing with various incantations their wax simulacra. The
process has been described over and over again, and we scarcely need
repeat it.</p>

Charles was lying sick of an incurable disease. The queen-mother
who had everything to lose in case of his death, resorted to necromancy,
and consulted the oracle of the “bleeding head.” This infernal operation
required the decapitation of a child who must be possessed of great
beauty and purity. He had been prepared in secret for his first communion,
by <em>the chaplain</em> of the palace, who was apprised of the plot, and at
midnight of the appointed day, in the chamber of the sick man, and in
presence only of Catherine and a few of her confederates, the “devil’s
mass” was celebrated. Let us give the rest of the story as we find it in
one of Levi’s works: “At this mass, celebrated before the image of the
demon, having under his feet a reversed cross, the sorcerer consecrated
two wafers, one black and one white. The white was given to the child,
whom they brought clothed as for baptism, and who was murdered upon
the very steps of the altar, immediately after his communion. His head,
separated from the trunk by a single blow, was placed, all palpitating,
upon the great black wafer which covered the bottom of the paten, then
placed upon a table where some mysterious lamps were burning. The
exorcism then began, and the demon was charged to pronounce an oracle,
and reply by the mouth of this head to a secret question that the
king dared not speak aloud, and that had been confided to no one. Then
a feeble voice, a strange voice, which had nothing of human character
about it, made itself audible in this poor little martyr’s head.” The sorcery
availed nothing; the king died, and—Catherine remained the faithful
daughter of Rome!</p>

<p>How strange, that des Mousseaux, who makes such free use of Bodin’s
materials to construct his formidable indictment against Spiritualists and
other sorcerers, should have overlooked this interesting episode!</p>

<p>It is a well-attested fact that Pope Sylvester <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was publicly accused
by Cardinal Benno with being a sorcerer and an enchanter. The brazen
“oracular head” made by his Holiness was of the same kind as the one
fabricated by Albertus Magnus. The latter was smashed to pieces by
Thomas Aquinas, not because it was the work of or inhabited by a
“demon,” but because the spook who was fixed inside, by mesmeric
power, talked incessantly, and his verbiage prevented the eloquent saint
from working out his mathematical problems. These heads and other
talking statues, trophies of the magical skill of monks and bishops, were
fac-similes of the “animated” gods of the ancient temples. The accusation
against the Pope was proved at the time. It was also demonstrated
that he was constantly attended by “demons” or spirits. In the preceding
chapter we have mentioned Benedict <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, John <abbr title="Twenty">XX.</abbr>, and the
<abbr title="Sixth">VIth</abbr> and <abbr title="Seventh">VIIth</abbr> Gregory, who were all known as magicians. The
latter Pope, moreover, was the famous Hildebrand, who was said to have

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
been so expert at “shaking lightning out of his sleeve.” An expression
which makes the venerable spiritualistic writer, Mr. Howitt, think that
“it was the origin of the celebrated thunder of the Vatican.”</p>

<p>The magical achievements of the Bishop of Ratisbon and those of the
“angelic doctor,” Thomas Aquinas, are too well known to need repetition;
but we may explain farther how the “illusions” of the former were
produced. If the Catholic bishop was so clever in making people believe
on a bitter winter night that they were enjoying the delights of a splendid
summer day, and cause the icicles hanging from the boughs of the trees
in the garden to seem like so many tropical fruits, the Hindu magicians
also practice such biological powers unto this very day, and claim the
assistance of neither god nor devil. Such “miracles” are all produced
by the same human power that is inherent in every man, if he only
knew how to develop it.</p>

<p>About the time of the Reformation, the study of alchemy and magic
had become so prevalent among the clergy as to produce great scandal.
Cardinal Wolsey was openly accused before the court and the privy-council
of confederacy with a man named Wood, a sorcerer, who said
that “<cite>My Lord Cardinale had suche a rynge that whatsomevere he askyd
of the Kynges grace that he hadd yt</cite>;” adding that “<cite>Master Cromwell,
when he ... was servaunt in my lord cardynales housse ... rede many
bokes and specyally the boke of Salamon ... and studied mettells and
what vertues they had after the canon of Salamon</cite>.” This case, with several
others equally curious, is to be found among the Cromwell papers in
the Record Office of the Rolls House.</p>

<p>A priest named William Stapleton was arrested as a conjurer, during
the reign of Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, and an account of his adventures is still
preserved in the Rolls House records. The Sicilian priest whom
Benvenuto Cellini calls a necromancer, became famous through his
successful conjurations, and was never molested. The remarkable
adventure of Cellini with him in the Colosseum, where the priest conjured
up a whole host of devils, is well known to the reading public.
The subsequent meeting of Cellini with his mistress, as predicted and
brought about by the conjurer, at the precise time fixed by him, is to
be considered, as a matter of course, a “curious coincidence.” In
the latter part of the sixteenth century there was hardly a parish to
be found in which the priests did not study magic and alchemy. The
practice of exorcism to cast out devils “in imitation of Christ,” who
by the way never used exorcism at all, led the clergy to devote themselves
openly to “sacred” magic in contradistinction to black art, of
which latter crime were accused all those who were neither priests nor
monks.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
The occult knowledge gleaned by the Roman Church from the once
fat fields of theurgy she sedulously guarded for her own use, and sent to
the stake only those practitioners who “poached” on her lands of the
<cite>Scientia Scientiarum</cite>, and those whose sins could not be concealed by the
friar’s frock. The proof of it lies in the records of history. “In the
course only of fifteen years, between 1580 to 1595, and only in the single
province of Lorraine, the President Remigius burned 900 witches,”
says Thomas Wright, in his <cite>Sorcery and Magic</cite>. It was during these
days, prolific in ecclesiastical murder and unrivalled for cruelty and
ferocity, that Jean Bodin wrote.</p>

<p>While the orthodox clergy called forth whole legions of “demons”
through magical incantations, unmolested by the authorities, provided
they held fast to the established dogmas and taught no heresy, on the
other hand, acts of unparalleled atrocity were perpetrated on poor, unfortunate
fools. Gabriel Malagrida, an old man of eighty, was burnt by these
evangelical Jack Ketches in 1761. In the Amsterdam library there is a
copy of the report of his famous trial, translated from the Lisbon edition.
He was accused of sorcery and illicit intercourse with the Devil, who had
“disclosed to him <em>futurity</em>.” (?) The prophecy imparted by the Arch-Enemy
to the poor visionary Jesuit is reported in the following terms:
“The culprit hath confessed that the demon, under the form of the blessed
Virgin, having commanded him to write the life of Antichrist (?), told him
that he, Malagrida, was a second John, but more clear than John the
Evangelist; that there were to be three Antichrists, and that the last
should be born at Milan, of a monk and a nun, in the year 1920; that
he would marry Proserpine, one of the infernal furies,” etc.</p>

<p>The prophecy is to be verified forty-three years hence. Even were all
the children born of monks and nuns really to become antichrists if
allowed to grow up to maturity, the fact would seem far less deplorable
than the discoveries made in so many convents when the foundations
have been removed for some reason. If the assertion of Luther is to be
disbelieved on account of his hatred for popery, then we may name discoveries
of the same character made quite recently in Austrian and
Russian Poland. Luther speaks of a fish-pond at Rome, situated near a
convent of nuns, which, having been cleared out by order of Pope Gregory,
disclosed, at the bottom, over six thousand infant skulls; and of a
nunnery at Neinburg, in Austria, whose foundations, when searched, disclosed
the same relics of celibacy and chastity!</p>

<p>“<i lang="la">Ecclesia non novit Sanguinem!</i>” meekly repeated the scarlet-robed
cardinals. And to avoid the spilling of blood which horrified them, they
instituted the Holy Inquisition. If, as the occultists maintain, and science
half confirms, our most trifling acts and thoughts are indelibly impressed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
upon the eternal mirror of the astral ether, there must be somewhere, in
the boundless realm of the unseen universe, the imprint of a curious
picture. It is that of a gorgeous standard waving in the heavenly breeze
at the foot of the great “white throne” of the Almighty. On its crimson
damask face a cross, symbol of “the Son of God who died for mankind,”
with an <em>olive</em> branch on one side, and a sword, stained to the hilt with
human gore, on the other. A legend selected from the <cite>Psalms</cite> emblazoned
in golden letters, reading thus: “<i lang="la">Exurge, Domine, et judica causam
meam.</i>” For such appears the standard of the Inquisition, on a
photograph in our possession, from an original procured at the Escurial
of Madrid.</p>

<p>Under this Christian standard, in the brief space of fourteen years,
Tomas de Torquemada, the confessor of Queen Isabella, burned over ten
thousand persons, and sentenced to the torture eighty thousand more.
Orobio, the well-known writer, who was detained so long in prison, and
who hardly escaped the flames of the Inquisition, immortalized this institution
in his works when once at liberty in Holland. He found no better
argument against the Holy Church than to embrace the Judaic faith and
submit even to circumcision. “In the cathedral of Saragossa,” says a
writer on the Inquisition, “is the tomb of a famous inquisitor. Six pillars
surround the tomb; <em>to each is chained a Moor</em>, as preparatory to being
burned.” On this <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Foix ingenuously observes: “If ever the Jack
Ketch of any country should be rich enough to have a splendid tomb, this
might serve as an excellent model!” To make it complete, however,
the builders of the tomb ought not to have omitted a bas-relief of the
famous horse which was burnt for sorcery and witchcraft. Granger tells
the story, describing it as having occurred in his time. The poor animal
“had been taught to tell the spots upon cards, and the hour of the day
by the watch. Horse and owner were both indicted by the sacred office
for dealing with the Devil, and both were burned, with a great ceremony
of <i lang="es">auto-da-fé</i>, at Lisbon, in 1601, as wizards!”</p>

<p>This immortal institution of Christianity did not remain without its
Dante to sing its praise. “Macedo, a Portuguese Jesuit,” says the author
of <cite>Demonologia</cite>, “has discovered the origin of the Inquisition, in the
terrestrial Paradise, and presumes to allege that God was the first who
began the functions of an inquisitor over Cain and the workmen of
Babel!”</p>

<p>Nowhere, during the middle ages, were the arts of magic and sorcery
more practiced by the clergy than in Spain and Portugal. The Moors
were profoundly versed in the occult sciences, and at Toledo, Seville,
and Salamanca, were, once upon a time, the great schools of magic. The
kabalists of the latter town were skilled in all the abstruse sciences; they

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
knew the virtues of precious stones and other minerals, and had extracted
from alchemy its most profound secrets.</p>

<p>The authentic documents pertaining to the great trial of the Marechale
d’Ancre, during the regency of Marie de Medicis, disclose that the unfortunate
woman perished through the fault of the priests with whom, like
a true Italian, she surrounded herself. She was accused by the people
of Paris of sorcery, because it had been asserted that she had used, after
the ceremony of exorcism, newly-killed white cocks. Believing herself
constantly bewitched, and being in very delicate health, the Marechale
had the ceremony of exorcism publicly applied to herself in the Church
of the Augustins; as to the birds, she used them as an application to
the forehead on account of dreadful pains in the head, and had been advised
to do so by Montalto, the Jew physician of the queen, and the Italian
priests.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, the Curé de Barjota, of the diocese of Callahora,
Spain, became the world’s wonder for his magical powers. His
most extraordinary feat consisted, it was said, in transporting himself to
any distant country, witnessing political and other events, and then
returning home to predict them in his own country. He had a familiar
demon, who served him faithfully for long years, says the <cite>Chronicle</cite>, but
the curé turned ungrateful and cheated him. Having been apprised by
his demon of a conspiracy against the Pope’s life, in consequence of an
intrigue of the latter with a fair lady, the curé transported himself to
Rome (in his double, of course) and thus saved his Holiness’ life. After
which he repented, confessed his sins to the gallant Pope, and <em>got absolution</em>.
“On his return he was delivered, as a matter of form, into the
custody of the inquisitors of Logroño, but was acquitted and restored to
his liberty very soon.”</p>

<p>Friar Pietro, a Dominican monk of the fourteenth century—the magician
who presented the famous Dr. Eugenio Torralva, a physician attached
to the house of the admiral of Castile, with a <em>demon</em> named Zequiel—won
his fame through the subsequent trial of Torralva. The procedure and
circumstances attendant upon the extraordinary trial are described in
the original papers preserved in the Archives of the Inquisition. The
Cardinal of Volterra, and the Cardinal of Santa Cruz, both saw and communicated
with Zequiel, who proved, during the whole of Torralva’s life,
to be a pure, kind, elemental spirit, doing many beneficent actions,
and remaining faithful to the physician to the last hour of his life.
Even the Inquisition acquitted Torralva, on that account; and, although
an immortality of fame was insured to him by the satire of Cervantes,
neither Torralva nor the monk Pietro are fictitious heroes, but historical
personages, recorded in ecclesiastical documents of Rome and Cuença,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
in which town the trial of the physician took place, January the 29th
1530.</p>

<p>The book of Dr. W. G. Soldan, of Stuttgart, has become as famous
in Germany, as Bodin’s book on <cite>Demonomania</cite> in France. It is the
most complete German treatise on witchcraft of the sixteenth century.
One interested to learn the secret machinery underlying these thousands
of legal murders, perpetrated by a clergy who pretended to believe in the
Devil, and succeeded in making others believe in him, will find it divulged
in the above-mentioned
 <span class="lock">work.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_87" id="FNanchor_87">[87]</a></span>
 The true origin of the daily accusations
and death-sentences for sorcery are cleverly traced to personal and
political enmities, and, above all, to the hatred of the Catholics toward
the Protestants. The crafty work of the Jesuits is seen at every page of
the bloody tragedies; and it is in Bamberg and Würzburg, where these
worthy sons of Loyola were most powerful at that time, that the cases of
witchcraft were most numerous. On the next page we give a curious list
of some victims, many of whom were children between the ages of seven
and eight years, and Protestants. “Of the multitudes of persons who
perished at the stake in Germany during the first half of the seventeenth
century for sorcery, the crime of many was their attachment to the religion
of Luther,” says T. Wright, “... and the petty princes were not
unwilling to seize upon any pretense to fill their coffers ... the persons
most persecuted being those whose property was a matter of consideration....
At Bamberg, as well as at Würzburg, the bishop was a sovereign
prince in his dominions. The Prince-Bishop, John George <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, who
ruled Bamberg ... after several unsuccessful attempts to root out Lutheranism,
distinguished his reign by a series of sanguinary witch-trials,
which disgrace the annals of that city.... We may form some notion
of the proceedings of his worthy
 <span class="lock">agent,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_88" id="FNanchor_88">[88]</a></span>
 from the statement of the most
authentic historians, that between 1625 and 1630, not less than 900 trials
took place in the two courts of Bamberg and Zeil; and a pamphlet published
at Bamberg by authority, in 1659, states the number of persons
whom Bishop John George had caused to be burned for sorcery, to have
been <span class="lock">600.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_89" id="FNanchor_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Regretting that space should prevent our giving one of the most
curious lists in the world of burned witches, we will nevertheless make a
few extracts from the original record as printed in Hauber’s <cite>Bibliotheca</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
<cite>Magica</cite>. One glance at this horrible catalogue of murders in Christ’s
name, is sufficient to discover that out of 162 persons burned, more than
one-half of them are designated as <em>strangers</em> (<i>i.e.</i>, Protestants) in this
hospitable town; and of the other half we find <em>thirty-four children</em>, the
oldest of whom was fourteen, the youngest <em>an infant</em> child of Dr. Schütz.
To make the catalogue shorter we will present of each of the twenty-nine
<em>burnings</em>, but the most remarkable.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_90" id="FNanchor_90">[90]</a><span class="lock"></span></p>

<p>“There were,” says Wright, “little girls of from seven to ten years
of age among the witches, and <em>seven and twenty</em> of them were convicted
and burnt,” at some of the other <i lang="de">brände</i>, or burnings. “The numbers
brought to trial in these terrible proceedings were so great, and they
were treated with so little consideration, that it was usual not even to
take the trouble of setting down their names, but they were cited as the
accused <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3, and so
 <span class="lock">on.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_91" id="FNanchor_91">[91]</a></span>
 The Jesuits took their confessions
in private.”</p>

<p>What room is there in a theology which exacts such holocausts as these
to appease the bloody appetites of its priests for the following gentle
words:</p>

<p>“Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for
of such is the kingdom of Heaven.” “Even so it is not the will of your
Father ... that one of these little ones should perish.” “But whoso
shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it <em>were better
for him that a millstone were hanged</em> about his neck and that he were
drowned in the depths of the sea.”</p>

<p>We sincerely hope that the above words have proved no vain threat
to these child-burners.</p>

<p>Did this butchery in the name of their Moloch-god prevent these
treasure-hunters from resorting to the black art themselves? Not in the
least; for in no class were such consulters of “familiar” spirits more
numerous than among the clergy during the fifteenth, sixteenth, and
seventeenth centuries. True, there were some Catholic priests among
the victims, but though these were generally accused of having “been

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
led into practices too dreadful to be described,” it was not so. In the
twenty-nine burnings above catalogued we find the names of <em>twelve
vicars</em>, <em>four</em> canons, and two doctors of divinity <em>burnt alive</em>. But we
have only to turn to such works as were published at the time to assure
ourselves that each popish priest executed was accused of “damnable
heresy,” <i>i.e.</i>, a tendency to reformation—a crime more heinous far than
sorcery.</p>

<p>We refer those who would learn how the Catholic clergy united duty
with pleasure in the matter of exorcisms, revenge, and treasure-hunting,
to volume <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, chapter <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, of W. Howitt’s
 <cite>History of the Supernatural</cite>.
“In the book called <cite lang="la">Pneumatologia Occulta et Vera</cite>, all the forms of
adjuration and conjuration were laid down,” says this veteran writer.
He then proceeds to give a long description of the favorite <i lang="la">modus
operandi</i>. The <cite lang="fr">Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie</cite> of the late Eliphas
Levi, treated with so much abuse and contempt by des Mousseaux,
tells nothing of the weird ceremonies and practices but what was practiced
legally and with the tacit if not open consent of the Church, by the
priests of the middle ages. The exorcist-priest entered a circle at midnight;
he was clad in a new surplice, and had a consecrated band hanging
from the neck, covered with sacred characters. He wore on the head a
tall pointed cap, on the front of which was written in Hebrew the holy
word, Tetragrammaton—the ineffable name. It was written with a new
pen dipped in the blood of a white dove. What the exorcists most
yearned after, was to release miserable spirits <em>which haunt spots where
hidden treasures lie</em>. The exorcist sprinkles the circle with the blood
of a black lamb and a white pigeon. The priest had to adjure the evil
spirits of hell—Acheront, Magoth, Asmodei, Beelzebub, Belial, and all the
damned souls, in the mighty names of Jehovah, Adonay, Elohah, and
Sabaioth, which latter was the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who
dwelt in the Urim and Thummim. When the damned souls flung in the
face of the exorcist that he was a sinner, and could not get the treasure
from them, the priest-sorcerer had to reply that “all his sins were washed
out in the blood of
 <span class="lock">Christ,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_92" id="FNanchor_92">[92]</a></span>
 and he bid them depart as cursed ghosts and
damned flies.” When the exorcist dislodged them at last, the poor soul
was “comforted in the name of the Saviour, and <em>consigned to the care of
good angels</em>,” who were less powerful, we must think, than the exorcising
Catholic worthies, “and the rescued treasure, of course, was secured for
the Church.”</p>

<p>“Certain days,” adds Howitt, “are laid down in the calendar of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Church as most favorable for the practice of exorcism; and, if the devils
are difficult to drive, a fume of sulphur, assafœtida, bear’s gall, and rue is
recommended, which, it was presumed, would outstench even devils.”</p>

<p>This is the Church, and this the priesthood, which, in the nineteenth
century, pays 5,000 priests to teach the people of the United States the
infidelity of science and the infallibility of the Bishop of Rome!</p>

<p>We have already noticed the confession of an eminent prelate
that the elimination of Satan from theology would be fatal to the perpetuity
of the Church. But this is only partially true. The Prince of
Sin would be gone, but sin itself would survive. If the Devil were
annihilated, the <cite>Articles of Faith</cite> and the <cite>Bible</cite> would remain. In short
there would still be a pretended divine revelation, and the necessity for
self-assumed inspired interpreters. We must, therefore, consider the
authenticity of the <cite>Bible</cite> itself. We must study its pages, and see if
they, indeed, contain the commands of the Deity, or but a compendium
of ancient traditions and hoary myths. We must try to interpret them
for ourselves—if possible. As to its pretended interpreters, the only
possible assimilation we can find for them in the <cite>Bible</cite> is to compare
them with the man described by the wise King Solomon in his <cite>Proverbs</cite>,
with the perpetrator of these “six things ... yea <em>seven</em> ... which
doth the Lord hate,” and which are an abomination unto Him, to wit:
“A <em>proud</em> look, a <em>lying</em> tongue, and hands that shed <em>innocent blood</em>;
an heart <em>that deviseth wicked imaginations</em>, feet that be swift in running
to mischief; a <em>false witness</em> that speaketh lies, and <i>he that soweth
discord among brethren</i>” (<cite>Proverbs</cite> <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 16, 17, 18, 19).</p>

<p>Of which of these accusations are the long line of men who have left
the imprint of their feet in the Vatican guiltless?</p>

<p>“When the demons,” says Augustine, “<em>insinuate</em> themselves in the
creatures, they begin by conforming themselves <em>to the will of every one</em>....
In order to attract men, they begin by seducing them, by simulating
obedience.... <em>How could one know, had he not been taught by the
demons themselves</em>, what they like or what they hate; <em>the name which attracts,
or that which forces them into obedience</em>; all this art, in short, of
<em>magic</em>, the whole science of the <span class="lock">magicians?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_93" id="FNanchor_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>To this impressive dissertation of the “saint,” we will add that no
magician has ever denied that he had learned the <em>art</em> from “spirits,”
whether, being a medium, they acted independently on him, or he had
been initiated into the science of “evocation” by his fathers who knew
it before himself. But who was it then that taught the exorcist? The priest

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
who clothes himself with an authority not only over the magician, but
even over all these “spirits,” whom he calls demons and <em>devils</em> as soon
as he finds them obeying any one but himself? He must have learned
somewhere from some one that power which he pretends to possess.
For, “... <cite>how could one know had he not been taught by the demons themselves
... the name which attracts, or that which forces them into obedience?</cite>”
asks Augustine.</p>

<p>Useless to remark that we know the answer beforehand: “Revelation
... <em>divine</em> gift ... the Son of God; nay, God Himself, through
His direct Spirit, who descended on the apostles as the Pentecostal fire,
and who is now alleged to overshadow every priest who sees fit to exorcise
for either glory or a gift. Are we then to believe that the recent
scandal of public exorcism, performed about the 14th of October, 1876,
by the senior priest of the Church of the Holy Spirit, at Barcelona, Spain,
was also done under the direct superintendence of the Holy Ghost?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_94" id="FNanchor_94">[94]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
It will be urged that the “bishop was not cognizant of this freak of the
clergy;” but even if he were, how could he have protested against a rite
considered since the days of the apostles, one of the most holy prerogatives
of the Church of Rome? So late as in 1852, only twenty-five
years ago, these rites received a public and solemn sanction from the
Vatican, and a new <cite>Ritual of Exorcism</cite> was published in Rome, Paris,
and other Catholic capitals. Des Mousseaux, writing under the immediate
patronage of Father Ventura, the General of the Theatines of
Rome, even favors us with lengthy extracts from this famous ritual, and
explains the reason <em>why</em> it was enforced again. It was in consequence
of the revival of Magic under the name of Modern Spiritualism. The
bull of Pope Innocent <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> is exhumed, and translated for the benefit
of des Mousseaux’s readers. “We have heard,” exclaims the Sovereign
Pontiff, “that a great number of persons of both sexes have feared not to
enter into relations with the spirits of hell; and that, by their practice of
sorcery ... they strike with sterility the conjugal bed, destroy the germs
of humanity in the bosom of the mother, and throw spells on them, and
set a barrier to the multiplication of animals ... etc., etc.;” then follow
curses and anathemas against the practice.</p>

<p>This belief of the Sovereign Pontiffs of an enlightened Christian country
is a direct inheritance by the most ignorant multitudes from the southern
Hindu rabble—the “heathen.” The diabolical arts of certain kangalins
(witches) and jadūgar (sorcerers) are firmly believed in by these people.
The following are among their most dreaded powers: to inspire love and
hatred at will; to send a devil to take possession of a person and torture

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
him; to expel him; to cause sudden death or an incurable disease; to
either strike cattle with or protect them from epidemics; to compose
philtres that will either strike with sterility or provoke unbounded passions
in men and women, etc., etc. The sight alone of a man said to be
such a sorcerer excites in a Hindu profound terror.</p>

<p>And now we will quote in this connection the truthful remark of a
writer who passed years in India in the study of the origin of such superstitions:
“Vulgar magic in India, like a degenerated infiltration, goes
hand-in-hand with the most ennobling beliefs of the sectarians of the
<i>Pitris</i>. It was the <em>work of the lowest clergy</em>, and designed to hold the
populace in a perpetual state of fear. It is thus that in all ages and
under every latitude, side by side with philosophical speculations of the
highest character, one always finds <em>the religion of the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>rabble</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_95" id="FNanchor_95">[95]</a></span>
 In
India it was the work of the <em>lowest clergy</em>; in Rome, that of the <em>highest
Pontiffs</em>. But then, have they not as authority their greatest saint,
Augustine, who declares that “whoever believes not in the evil spirits,
refuses to believe in Holy <span class="lock">Writ?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_96" id="FNanchor_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, in the second half of the nineteenth century, we find the
counsel for the Sacred Congregation of Rites (exorcism of demons included),
Father Ventura de Raulica, writing thus, in a letter published
by des Mousseaux, in 1865:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We are in full magic! and under false names; the Spirit of lies and impudicity
goes on perpetrating his horrible deprecations.... The most grievous feature in this
is that among the most serious persons they do not attach the importance to the strange
phenomena which they deserve, these manifestations that we witness, and which become
with every day more weird, striking, as well as most fatal.</p>

<p>“I cannot sufficiently admire and praise, from this standpoint, the zeal and courage
displayed by you in your work. The facts which you have collected are calculated to
throw light and conviction into the most skeptical minds; and after reading this remarkable
work, written with so much learnedness and consciousness, blindness is no longer
possible.</p>

<p>“If anything could surprise us, it would be the indifference with which these phenomena
have been treated by <em>false</em> Science, endeavoring, as she has, to turn into ridicule
so grave a subject; the childish simplicity exhibited by her in the desire to explain the
facts by absurd and contradictory <span class="lock">hypotheses....<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_97" id="FNanchor_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p class="right r2">
[Signed] “<i>The Father Ventura de Raulica</i>, etc., etc.”<br>

<p>Thus encouraged by the greatest authorities of the Church of Rome,
ancient and modern, the Chevalier argues the necessity and the efficacy of
exorcism by the priests. He tries to demonstrate—<em>on faith</em>, as usual—

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
that the power of the spirits of hell is closely related to certain rites,
words, and formal signs. “In the diabolical Catholicism,” he says
“as well as in the <em>divine</em> Catholicism, potential grace is <em>bound</em> (<i lang="fr">liée</i>) to
certain signs.” While the power of the Catholic priest proceeds from
God, that of the Pagan priest proceeds from the Devil. The Devil, he
adds, “is forced to submission” before the holy minister of God—“<em>he
dares not</em> <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">LIE</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_98" id="FNanchor_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>We beg the reader to note well the underlined sentence, as we
mean to test its truth impartially. We are prepared to adduce proofs,
undeniable and undenied even by the Popish Church—forced, as she
was, into the confession—proofs of hundreds of cases in relation to the
most solemn of her dogmas, wherein the “spirits” lied from beginning
to end. How about certain holy relics authenticated by visions of the
blessed Virgin, and a host of saints? We have at hand a treatise by a
pious Catholic, Jilbert de Nogen, on the relics of saints. With honest
despair he acknowledges the “great number of false relics, as well as
false legends,” and severely censures the inventors of these lying miracles.
“It was on the occasion <em>of one of our Saviour’s teeth</em>,” writes the
author of <cite>Demonologia</cite>, “that de Nogen took up his pen on this subject,
by which the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Medard de Soissons pretended to work miracles;
a pretension which he asserted to be as chimerical as that of several
persons who believed they possessed the navel, and other parts less
comely, of the body of <span class="lock">Christ.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_99" id="FNanchor_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>“A monk of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Antony,” says Stephens,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_100" id="FNanchor_100">[100]</a> “having been at Jerusalem,
saw there several relics, among which was a bit of <em>the finger of the
Holy Ghost</em>, as sound and entire as it had ever been; the snout of the
seraph that appeared to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis; one of the nails of a cherub;
one of the ribs of the <i lang="la">Verbum caro factum</i> (the Word made flesh); some
rays of the star that appeared to the three kings of the East; a phial of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael’s sweat, that exuded when he was fighting against the Devil,
etc. ‘All which things,’ observes the monkish treasurer of relics, ‘I have
brought with me home very devoutly.’”</p>

<p>And if the foregoing is set aside as the invention of a Protestant enemy,
may we not be allowed to refer the reader to the History of England and
authentic documents which state the existence of a relic not less extraordinary
than the best of the others? Henry <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> received from the Grand
Master of the Templars a phial containing a small portion of the sacred
blood of Christ which he had shed upon the cross. It was attested to be
genuine by the seals of the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and others. The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
procession bearing the sacred phial from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s to Westminster Abbey
is described by the historian: “Two monks received the phial, and
deposited it in the Abbey ... which made all England shine with glory,
dedicating it to God and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edward.”</p>

<p>The story of the Prince Radzivil is well known. It was the undeniable
deception of the monks and nuns surrounding him and his own
confessor which made the Polish nobleman become a Lutheran. He felt
at first so indignant at the “heresy” of the Reformation spreading in
Lithuania, that he travelled all the way to Rome to pay his homage of
sympathy and veneration to the Pope. The latter presented him with a
precious box of relics. On his return home, his confessor saw the Virgin,
who descended from her glorious abode for the sole purpose of blessing
these relics and authenticating them. The superior of the neighboring
convent and the mother-abbess of a nunnery both saw the same vision,
with a reënforcement of several saints and martyrs; they prophesied and
“felt the Holy Ghost” ascending from the box of relics and overshadowing
the prince. A demoniac provided for the purpose by the clergy was
exorcised in full ceremony, and upon being touched by the box immediately
recovered, and rendered thanks on the spot to the Pope and the
Holy Ghost. After the ceremony was over the guardian of the treasury
in which the relics were kept, threw himself at the feet of the prince, and
confessed that on their way back from Rome he had lost the box of relics.
Dreading the wrath of his master, he had procured a similar box, “which
he had filled with the small bones of dogs and cats;” but seeing how the
prince was deceived, he preferred confessing his guilt to such blasphemous
tricks. The prince said nothing, but continued for some time testing—not
the relics, but his confessor and the vision-seers. Their mock raptures
made him discover so thoroughly the gross impositions of the monks and
nuns that he joined the Reformed Church.</p>

<p>This is history. Bayle shows that when the Roman Church is no
longer able to deny that there have been false relics, she resorts to sophistry,
and replies that if false relics have wrought miracles it is “because
of the good intentions of the believers, who thus obtained from God a
reward of their good faith!” The same Bayle shows, by numerous instances,
that whenever it was proved that several bodies of the same saint,
or three heads of him, or three arms (as in the case of Augustine) were said
to exist in different places, and that they could not well be all authentic,
the cool and invariable answer of the Church was that they were all
genuine; for “God had multiplied and miraculously reproduced them
for the greater glory of His Holy Church!” In other words they would
have the faithful believe that the body of a deceased saint may, through
divine miracle, acquire the physiological peculiarities of a crawfish!</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
We fancy that it would be hard to demonstrate to satisfaction that the
visions of Catholic saints, are, in any one particular instance, better or
more trustworthy than the average visions and prophecies of our modern
“mediums.” The visions of Andrew Jackson Davis—however our critics
may sneer at them—are by long odds more philosophical and more compatible
with modern science than the Augustinian speculations. Whenever
the visions of Swedenborg, the greatest among the modern seers,
run astray from philosophy and scientific truth, it is when they most run
parallel with theology. Nor are these visions any more useless to either
science or humanity than those of the great orthodox saints. In the life
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernard it is narrated that as he was once in church, upon a Christmas
eve, he prayed that the very hour in which Christ was born might be
revealed to him; and when the “true and correct hour came, he saw the
divine babe appear in his manger.” What a pity that the divine babe did
not embrace so favorable an opportunity to fix the correct day and year
of his death, and thereby reconcile the controversies of his putative
historians. The Tischendorfs, Lardners, and Colensos, as well as many
a Catholic divine, who have vainly squeezed the marrow out of historical
records and their own brains, in the useless search, would at least have
had something for which to thank the saint.</p>

<p>As it is, we are hopelessly left to infer that most of the beatific and
divine visions of the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>, and those to be found in the more
complete biographies of the most important “saints,” as well as most
of the visions of our own persecuted seers and seeresses, were produced
by ignorant and undeveloped “spirits” passionately fond of personating
great historical characters. We are quite ready to agree with the Chevalier
des Mousseaux, and other unrelenting persecutors of magic and spiritualism
in the name of the Church, that modern spirits are often “lying
spirits;” that they are ever on hand to humor the respective hobbies of
the persons who communicate with them at “circles;” that they <em>deceive</em>
them and, therefore, are not <em>always</em> good “spirits.”</p>

<p>But, having conceded so much, we will now ask of any impartial
person: is it possible to believe at the same time that the <em>power</em> given
to the exorcist-priest, that supreme and <em>divine</em> power of which he boasts,
has been given to him by God for the purpose of deceiving people?
That the prayer pronounced by him <em>in the name of Christ</em>, and which,
forcing the <em>demon</em> into submission, makes him reveal himself, is calculated
at the same time to make the devil confess <em>not the truth</em>, but that only
which it is the <em>interest of the church to which the exorcist belongs</em>, should
<em>pass for truth</em>? And this is what invariably happens. Compare, for
instance, the responses given by the demon to Luther, with those
obtained from the devils by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick. The one argues against the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
private mass, and upbraids Luther with placing the Virgin Mary and
saints before Christ, and thus dishonoring the Son of
 <span class="lock">God;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_101" id="FNanchor_101">[101]</a></span>
 while the
demons exorcised by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick, upon seeing the Virgin whom the
holy father had also evoked to help him, roar out: “Oh! our enemy!
oh! our damner! ... why didst thou descend from heaven to torment us?
Why art thou so powerful an intercessor for sinners! Oh! <em>thou most
certain and secure way to heaven</em> ... thou commandest us <em>and we are
forced to confess</em> that nobody is damned who only perseveres in thy holy
worship, etc.,
 <span class="lock">etc.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_102" id="FNanchor_102">[102]</a></span>
 Luther’s “Saint Satan” assures him that while
believing in the transubstantiation of Christ’s body and blood he had
been worshipping merely bread and wine; and the <em>devils</em> of all the
Catholic saints promise <em>eternal damnation</em> to whomsoever disbelieves or
even so much as doubts the dogma!</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject, let us give one or two more instances from
the <cite>Chronicles of the Lives of the Saints</cite>, selected from such narratives
as are fully accepted by the Church. We might fill volumes with proofs
of undeniable confederacy between the exorcisers and the demons. Their
very nature betrays them. Instead of being independent, crafty entities,
bent on the destruction of men’s souls and spirits, the majority of them
are simply the elementals of the kabalists; creatures with no intellect
of their own, but faithful mirrors of the <span class="allsmcap">WILL</span> which evokes, controls, and
guides them. We will not waste our time in drawing the reader’s attention
to doubtful or obscure thaumaturgists and exorcisers, but take as
our standard one of the greatest saints of Catholicism, and select a bouquet
from that same prolific conservatory of pious lies, <cite>The Golden
Legend</cite>, of James de <span class="lock">Veragine.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_103" id="FNanchor_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick, the founder of the famous order of that name, is one of
the mightiest saints on the calendar. His order was the first that received
a solemn confirmation from the
 <span class="lock">Pope,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_104" id="FNanchor_104">[104]</a></span>
 and he is well known in history
as the associate and counsellor of the infamous Simon de Montford, the
papal general, whom he helped to butcher the unfortunate Albigenses in
and near Toulouse. The story goes that this saint and the Church after
him, claim that he received from the Virgin, <i lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>, a rosary,
whose virtues produced such stupendous miracles that they throw entirely
into the shade those of the apostles, and even of Jesus himself. A man,
says the biographer, an abandoned sinner, was bold enough to doubt the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
virtue of the Dominican rosary; and for this unparalleled blasphemy was
punished on the spot by having 15,000 devils take possession of him.
Seeing the great suffering of the tortured demoniac, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dominick forgot
the insult and called the devils to account.</p>

<p>Following is the colloquy between the “blessed exorcist” and the
demons:</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—How did you take possession of this man, and how many
are you?</p>

<p><i>Answer of the Devils.</i>—We came into him for having spoken disrespectfully
of the rosary. We are 15,000.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>—Why did so many as 15,000 enter him?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>—Because there are fifteen decades in the rosary which he
derided, etc.</p>

<p><i>Dominick.</i>—Is not all true I have said of the virtues of the rosary?</p>

<p><i>Devils.</i>—Yes! Yes! (<em>they emit flames through the nostrils of the
demoniac</em>). Know all ye Christians that Dominick never said one word
concerning the rosary that is not most true; and know ye further, that
if you do not believe him, great calamities will befall you.</p>

<p><i>Dominick.</i>—Who is the man in the world the Devil hates the most?</p>

<p><i>Devils.</i>—(<i>In chorus.</i>) Thou art the very man (<i>here follow verbose
compliments</i>).</p>

<p><i>Dominick.</i>—Of which state of Christians are there the most damned?</p>

<p><i>Devils.</i>—In hell we have merchants, pawnbrokers, fraudulent bankers,
grocers, Jews, apothecaries, etc., etc.</p>

<p><i>Dominick.</i>—Are there any priests or monks in hell?</p>

<p><i>Devils.</i>—There are a great number of priests, but <em>no monks</em>, with the
exception of such as have transgressed the rule of their order.</p>

<p><i>Dominick.</i>—Have you any Dominicans?</p>

<p><i>Devils.</i>—Alas! alas! we have not one yet, but we expect a great
number of them after their devotion is a little cooled.</p>

<p>We do not pretend to give the questions and answers literally, for
they occupy twenty-three pages; but the substance is here, as may be
seen by any one who cares to read the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>. The full description
of the hideous bellowings of the demons, their enforced glorification
of the saint, and so on, is too long for this chapter. Suffice it to say
that as we read the numerous questions offered by Dominick and the
answers of the demons, we become fully convinced that they corroborate
in every detail the unwarranted assertions and support the interests of
the Church. The narrative is suggestive. The legend graphically
describes the battle of the exorcist with the legion from the bottomless
pit. The sulphurous flames which burst forth from the nose, mouth,
eyes, and ears, of the demoniac; the sudden appearance of over a hundred

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
angels, clad in golden armor; and, finally, the descent of the blessed
Virgin herself, in person, bearing a golden rod, with which she administers
a sound thrashing to the demoniac, to force the devils to confess that
of herself which we scarcely need repeat. The whole catalogue of theological
truths uttered by Dominick’s devils were embodied in so many
articles of faith by his Holiness, the present Pope, in 1870, at the last
Œcumenical Council.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it is easy to see that the only substantial difference
between infidel “mediums” and orthodox saints lies in the relative
usefulness of the <em>demons</em>, if demons we must call them. While the Devil
faithfully supports the Christian exorcist in his <em>orthodox</em> (?) views, the
modern spook generally leaves his medium in the lurch. For, by lying,
he acts <em>against</em> his or her interests rather than otherwise, and thereby
too often casts foul suspicion on the genuineness of the mediumship.
Were modern “spirits” <em>devils</em>, they would evidently display a little more
discrimination and cunning than they do. They would act as the <em>demons</em>
of the saint which, compelled by the ecclesiastical magician and by the
power of “the name ... which forces them into submission,” <em>lie in
accordance with the direct interest</em> of the exorcist and his church. The
moral of the parallel we leave to the sagacity of the reader.</p>

<p>“Observe well,” exclaims des Mousseaux, “that there are <em>demons</em>
which sometimes will speak the truth.” “The exorcist,” he adds, quoting
the <cite>Ritual</cite>, “must command the demon to tell him whether he is detained
in the body of the demoniac through some magic art, or by <em>signs</em>,
or any objects which usually serve for this evil practice. In case the
exorcised person has swallowed the latter, he must vomit them back;
and if they are not in his body, the demon must indicate the proper place
where they are to be found; and having found them they must be
burned.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_105" id="FNanchor_105">[105]</a>
 Thus some demons reveal the existence of the bewitchment,
tell who is its author, and indicate the means to destroy the <em>malefice</em>.
But beware to ever resort, in such a case, to magicians, sorcerers, or
mediums. You must call to help you but the minister of your Church!
“The Church believes in magic, as you well see,” he adds, “since she
expresses it so formally. And those who <em>disbelieve in magic</em>, can they
still hope to share the faith of their own Church? And who can teach
them better? To whom did Christ say: ‘Go ye therefore, and teach all
nations ... and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the
<span class="lock">world?’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_106" id="FNanchor_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Are we to believe that he said this but to those who wear these black

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
or scarlet liveries of Rome? Must we then credit the story that this
power was given by Christ to Simon Stylites, the saint who sanctified
himself by perching on a pillar (<i>stylos</i>) sixty feet high, for thirty-six years
of his life, without ever descending from it, in order that, among other
miracles stated in the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>, he might cure a <em>dragon</em> of a sore
eye? “Near Simon’s pillar was the dwelling of a dragon, so very
venomous that the stench was spread for miles round his cave.” This
ophidian-hermit met with an accident; he got a thorn in his eye, and,
becoming blind, crept to the saint’s pillar, and pressed his eye against it
for three days, without touching any one. Then the blessed saint, from
his aërial seat, “<em>three feet in diameter</em>,” ordered earth and water to be
placed on the dragon’s eye, out of which suddenly emerged a thorn (or
stake), a cubit in length; when the people saw the “miracle” they glorified
the Creator. As to the grateful dragon, he arose and, “having adored
God for two hours, returned to his cave”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_107" id="FNanchor_107">[107]</a>—a half-converted ophidian,
we must suppose.</p>

<p>And what are we to think of that other narrative, to disbelieve in
which is “<cite>to risk one’s salvation</cite>,” as we were informed by a Pope’s
missionary, of the Order of the Franciscans? When <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis preached
a sermon in the wilderness, the birds assembled from the four cardinal
points of the world. They warbled and applauded every sentence; they
sang a holy mass in chorus; finally they dispersed to carry the glad
tidings all over the universe. A grasshopper, profiting by the absence
of the Holy Virgin, who generally kept company with the saint, remained
perched on the head of the “blessed one” for a whole week. Attacked
by a ferocious wolf, the saint, who had no other weapon but the sign
of the cross which he made upon himself, instead of running away from
his rabid assailant, began arguing with the beast. Having imparted to
him the benefit to be derived from the holy religion, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis never
ceased talking until the wolf became as meek as a lamb, and even
shed tears of repentance over his past sins. Finally, he “stretched his
paws in the hands of the saint, followed him like a dog through all the
towns in which he preached, and became half a
 <span class="lock">Christian!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_108" id="FNanchor_108">[108]</a></span>
 Wonders
of zoölogy! a horse turned sorcerer, a wolf and a dragon turned Christians!</p>

<p>These two anecdotes, chosen at random from among hundreds, if
rivalled are not surpassed by the wildest romances of the Pagan thaumaturgists,
magicians, and spiritualists! And yet, when Pythagoras is
said to have subdued animals, even wild beasts, merely through a powerful
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
mesmeric influence, he is pronounced by one-half of the Catholics a
bare-faced impostor, and by the rest a sorcerer, who worked magic in
confederacy with the Devil! Neither the she-bear, nor the eagle, nor
yet the bull that Pythagoras is said to have persuaded to give up eating
beans, were alleged to have answered with human voices; while <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Benedict’s
“black raven,” whom he called “brother,” argues with him, and
croaks his answers like a born casuist. When the saint offers him one-half
of a poisoned loaf, the raven grows indignant and reproaches him in
Latin as though he had just graduated at the Propaganda!</p>

<p>If it be objected that the <cite>Golden Legend</cite> is now but half supported
by the Church; and that it is known to have been compiled by the writer
from a collection of the lives of the saints, for the most part unauthenticated,
we can show that, at least in one instance, the biography is no
legendary compilation, but the history of one man, by another one who
was his contemporary. Jortin and Gibbons demonstrated years ago, that
the early fathers used to select narratives, wherewith to ornament the
lives of their apocryphal saints, from Ovid, Homer, Livy, and even from
the unwritten popular legends of Pagan nations. But such is not the case
in the above instances. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bernard lived in the twelfth century, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Dominick was nearly contemporaneous with the author of the <cite>Golden
Legend</cite>. De Veragine died in 1298, and Dominick, whose exorcisms
and life he describes so minutely, instituted his order in the first quarter
of the thirteenth century. Moreover, de Veragine was Vicar-General of
the Dominicans himself, in the middle of the same century, and therefore
described the miracles wrought by his hero and patron but a few years
after they were alleged to have happened. He wrote them in the same
convent; and while narrating these wonders he had probably fifty persons
at hand who had been eye-witnesses to the saint’s mode of living. What
must we think, in such a case, of a biographer who seriously describes the
following: One day, as the blessed saint was occupied in his study, the
Devil began pestering him, in the shape of a flea. He frisked and jumped
about the pages of his book until the harassed saint, unwilling as he was
to act unkindly, even toward a devil, felt compelled to punish him by
fixing the troublesome devil on the very sentence on which he stopped,
by clasping the book. At another time the same devil appeared under
the shape of a monkey. He grinned so horribly that Dominick, in order
to get rid of him, ordered the devil-monkey to take the candle and hold
it for him until he had done reading. The poor imp did so, and held it
until it was consumed to the very end of the wick; and, notwithstanding
his pitiful cries for mercy, the saint compelled him to hold it till his fingers
were burned to the bones!</p>

<p>Enough! The approbation with which this book was received by the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Church, and the peculiar sanctity attributed to it, is sufficient to show the
estimation in which veracity was held by its patrons. We may add, in
conclusion, that the finest quintessence of Boccaccio’s <cite>Decameron</cite> appears
prudery itself by comparison with the filthy realism of the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>.</p>

<p>We cannot regard with too much astonishment the pretensions of the
Catholic Church in seeking to convert Hindus and Buddhists to Christianity.
While the “heathen” keeps to the faith of his fathers, he has at
least the one redeeming quality—that of not having apostatized for the
mere pleasure of exchanging one set of idols for another. There may be
for him some novelty in his embracing Protestantism; for in that he gains
the advantage, at least, of limiting his religious views to their simplest
expression. But when a Buddhist has been enticed into exchanging his
Shoe Dagoon for the Slipper of the Vatican, or the eight hairs from the
head of Gautama and Buddha’s tooth, which work miracles, for the locks
of a Christian saint, and a tooth of Jesus, which work far less clever
miracles, he has no cause to boast of his choice. In his address to the
Literary Society of Java, Sir T. S. Raffles is said to have narrated the following
characteristic anecdote: “On visiting the great temple on the
hills of Nangasaki, the English commissioner was received with marked
regard and respect by the venerable patriarch of the northern provinces,
a man eighty years of age, who entertained him most sumptuously. On
showing him round the courts of the temple, one of the English officers
present heedlessly exclaimed, in surprise, ‘Jesus Christus!’ The patriarch
turning half round, with a placid smile, bowed significantly, with the
expression: ‘We know your Jasus Christus! Well, don’t obtrude him
upon us in our temples, and we remain friends.’ And so, with a hearty
shake of the hands, these two opposites <span class="lock">parted.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_109" id="FNanchor_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>There is scarcely a report sent by the missionaries from India, Thibet,
and China, but laments the diabolical “obscenity” of the heathen rites,
their lamentable impudicity; all of which “are so strongly suggestive of
devil-worship,” as des Mousseaux tells us. We can scarcely be assured
that the morality of the Pagans would be in the least improved were they
allowed a free inquiry into the life of say the psalmist-king, the author
of those sweet <cite>Psalms</cite> which are so rapturously repeated by Christians.
The difference between David performing a phallic dance before the holy
ark—emblem of the female principle—and a Hindu Vishnavite bearing
the same emblem on his forehead, favors the former only in the eyes of
those who have studied neither the ancient faith nor their own. When a
religion which compelled David to cut off and deliver two hundred foreskins
of his enemies before he could become the king’s son-in-law
 (<cite>1 <abbr title="Samuel">Sam.</abbr></cite> <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr>)

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
is accepted as a standard by Christians, they would do well not to
cast into the teeth of heathen the impudicities of their faiths. Remembering
the suggestive parable of Jesus, they ought to cast the beam out of
their own eye before plucking at the mote in their neighbor’s. The sexual
element is as marked in Christianity as in any one of the “heathen religions.”
Certainly, nowhere in the <cite>Vedas</cite> can be found the coarseness and
downright immodesty of language, that Hebraists now discover throughout
the Mosaic <cite>Bible</cite>.</p>

<p>It would profit little were we to dwell much upon subjects which have
been disposed of in such a masterly way by an anonymous author whose
work electrified England and Germany last
 <span class="lock">year;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_110" id="FNanchor_110">[110]</a></span>
 while as regards the
particular topic under notice, we cannot do better than recommend the
scholarly writings of Dr. Inman. Albeit one-sided, and in many instances
unjust to the ancient heathen, Pagan, and Jewish religions, the <em>facts</em>
treated in the <cite>Ancient and Pagan Christian Symbolism</cite>, are unimpeachable.
Neither can we agree with some English critics who charge him
with an intent to destroy Christianity. If by <em>Christianity</em> is meant the external
religious forms of worship, then he certainly seeks to destroy it, for in
his eyes, as well as in those of every truly religious man, who has studied
ancient exoteric faiths, and their symbology, Christianity is pure heathenism,
and Catholicism, with its fetish-worshipping, is far worse and more
pernicious than Hinduism in its most idolatrous aspect. But while
denouncing the exoteric forms and unmasking the symbols, it is not the
religion of Christ that the author attacks, but the artificial system of theology.
We will allow him to illustrate the position in his own language,
and quote from his preface:</p>

<p>“When vampires were discovered by the acumen of any observer,”
he says, “they were, we are told, ignominiously killed, by a stake being
driven through the body; but experience showed them to have such
tenacity of life that they rose, again and again, notwithstanding renewed
impalement, and were not ultimately laid to rest till wholly burned. In
like manner, the regenerated heathendom, which dominates over the
followers of Jesus of Nazareth, has risen again and again, after being
transfixed. Still cherished by the many, it is denounced by the few.
Amongst other accusers, I raise my voice against the Paganism which
exists so extensively in ecclesiastical Christianity, and will do my utmost
to expose the imposture.... In a vampire story told in <cite>Thalaba</cite>, by
Southey, the resuscitated being takes the form of a dearly-beloved maiden,
and the hero is obliged to kill her with his own hand. He does so; but,
whilst he strikes the form of the loved one, he feels sure that he slays

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
only a demon. In like manner, when I endeavor to destroy the current
heathenism, which has assumed the garb of Christianity, <cite>I do not attack</cite>
real
 <span class="lock"><cite>religion</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_111" id="FNanchor_111">[111]</a></span>
 Few would accuse a workman of malignancy, who
cleanses from filth the surface of a noble statue. There may be some
who are too nice to touch a nasty subject, yet even they will rejoice when
some one else removes the dirt. Such a scavenger is <span class="lock">wanted.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_112" id="FNanchor_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But is it merely Pagans and heathen that the Catholics persecute,
and about whom, like Augustine, they cry to the Deity, “Oh, my God!
<cite>so do I wish Thy enemies to be slain?</cite>” Oh, no! their aspirations are
more Mosaic and Cain-like than that. It is against their next of kin in
faith, against their schismatic brothers that they are now intriguing within
the walls which sheltered the murderous Borgias. The <i lang="la">larvæ</i> of the
infanticidal, parricidal, and fratricidal Popes have proved themselves fit
counsellors for the Cains of Castelfidardo and Mentana. It is now the
turn of the Slavonian Christians, the Oriental Schismatics—the Philistines
of the Greek Church!</p>

<p>His Holiness the Pope, after exhausting, in a metaphor of self-laudation,
every point of assimilation between the great biblical prophets and
himself, has finally and truly compared himself with the Patriarch Jacob
“wrestling against his God.” He now crowns the edifice of Catholic
piety by openly sympathizing with the Turks! The vicegerent of God
inaugurates his infallibility by encouraging, in a true Christian spirit, the
acts of that Moslem David, the modern Bashi Bazuk; and it seems as
if nothing would more please his Holiness than to be presented by the
latter with several thousands of the Bulgarian or Servian “foreskins.”
True to her policy to be all things to all men to promote her own interests,
the Romish Church is, at this writing (1876), benevolently viewing
the Bulgarian and Servian atrocities, and, probably, manœuvring with
Turkey against Russia. Better Islam, and the hitherto-hated Crescent
over the sepulchre of the Christian god, than the Greek Church established
at Constantinople and Jerusalem as the state religion. Like a
decrepit and toothless ex-tyrant in exile, the Vatican is eager for any
alliance that promises, if not a restoration of its own power, at least the
weakening of its rival. The axe its inquisitors once swung, it now toys

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
with in secret, feeling its edge, and waiting, and hoping against hope. In
her time, the Popish Church has lain with strange bedfellows, but never
before now sunk to the degradation of giving her moral support to those
who for over 1200 years spat in her face, called her adherents “infidel
dogs,” repudiated her teachings, and denied godhood to her God!</p>

<p>The press of even Catholic France is fairly aroused at this indignity,
and openly accuses the Ultramontane portion of the Catholic Church
and the Vatican of siding, during the present Eastern struggle, with the
Mahometan against the Christian. “When the Minister of Foreign
Affairs in the French Legislature spoke some mild words in favor of the
Greek Christians, he was only applauded by the liberal Catholics, and
received coldly by the Ultramontane party,” says the French correspondent
of a New York paper.</p>

<p>“So pronounced was this, that M. Lemoinne, the well-known editor
of the great liberal Catholic journal, the <cite lang="fr">Débats</cite>, was moved to say that
the Roman Church felt more sympathy for the Moslem than the schismatic,
just as they preferred an infidel to the Protestant. ‘There is at
bottom,’ says this writer, ‘a great affinity between the <cite>Syllabus</cite> and the
<cite>Koran</cite>, and between the two heads of the faithful. The two systems are
of the same nature, and are united on the common ground of a one and
unchangeable theory.’ In Italy, in like manner, the King and Liberal
Catholics are in warm sympathy with the unfortunate Christians, while
the Pope and Ultramontane faction are believed to be inclining to the
Mahometans.”</p>

<p>The civilized world may yet expect the apparition of the materialized
Virgin Mary within the walls of the Vatican. The so often-repeated
“miracle” of the Immaculate Visitor in the mediæval ages has recently
been enacted at Lourdes, and why not once more, as a <i lang="fr">coup de grâce</i> to
all heretics, schismatics, and infidels? The miraculous wax taper is yet
seen at Arras, the chief city of Artois; and at every new calamity threatening
her beloved Church, the “Blessed Lady” appears personally, and
lights it with her own fair hands, in view of a whole “biologized” congregation.
This sort of “miracle,” says E. Worsley, wrought by the
Roman Catholic Church, “being most certain, and never doubted of by
<span class="lock">any.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_113" id="FNanchor_113">[113]</a></span>
 Neither has the private correspondence with which the most
“Gracious Lady” honors her friends been doubted. There are two
precious missives from her in the archives of the Church. The first purports
to be a letter in answer to one addressed to her by Ignatius. She
confirms all things learned by her correspondent from “her friend”—meaning

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the Apostle John. She bids him hold fast to his vows, and adds
as an inducement: “<cite>I and John will come together and pay you a</cite>
<span class="lock"><cite>visit.</cite>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_114" id="FNanchor_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing was known of this unblushing fraud till the letters were published
at Paris, in 1495. By a curious accident it appeared at a time
when threatening inquiries began to be made as to the genuineness of
the fourth Synoptic. Who could doubt, after such a confirmation from
headquarters! But the climax of effrontery was capped in 1534, when
another letter was received from the “Mediatrix,” which sounds more like
the report of a lobby-agent to a brother-politician. It was written in excellent
Latin, and was found in the Cathedral of Messina, together with the
image to which it alludes. Its contents run as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mary Virgin, Mother of the Redeemer of the world, to the Bishop, Clergy, and
the other faithful of Messina, sendeth health and benediction from <em>herself</em>
 and <span class="lock">son:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_115" id="FNanchor_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whereas ye have been mindful of establishing the worship of me; now this is to
let you know that by so doing ye have found great favor in my sight. I have a long
time reflected with pain upon your city, which is exposed to much danger from its contiguity
to the fire of Etna, and I have often had words about it with my son, for he
was vexed with you because of your guilty neglect of my worship, so that he would
not care a pin about my intercession. Now, however, that you have come to your
senses, and have happily begun to worship me, he has conferred upon me the right to
become your everlasting protectress; but, at the same time, I warn you to mind what
you are about, and give me no cause of repenting of my kindness to you. The prayers
and festivals instituted in my honor please me tremendously (<i lang="de">vehementer</i>), and if you
faithfully persevere in these things, and provided you oppose to the utmost of your
power, the heretics which now-a-days are spreading through the world, by which both
my worship and that of the other saints, male and female, are so endangered, you shall
enjoy my perpetual protection.</p>

<p>“In sign of this compact, I send you down from Heaven the image of myself, cast
by celestial hands, and if ye hold it in the honor to which it is entitled, it will be an
evidence to me of your obedience and your faith. Farewell. Dated in Heaven,
whilst sitting near the throne of my son, in the month of December, of the 1534th
year from his incarnation.</p>

<p>The reader should understand that this document is no anti-Catholic
forgery. The author from whom it is
 <span class="lock">taken,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_116" id="FNanchor_116">[116]</a></span>
 says that the authenticity
of the missive “is attested by the Bishop himself, his Vicar-General,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Secretary, and six Canons of the Cathedral Church of Messina, all of
whom have signed that attestation with their names, and confirmed it
upon oath.</p>

<p>“Both the epistle and image were found upon the high altar, where
they had been placed by angels from heaven.”</p>

<p>A Church must have reached the last stages of degradation, when
such sacrilegious trickery as this could be resorted to by its clergy, and
accepted with or without question by the people.</p>

<p>No! far from the man who feels the workings of an immortal spirit
within him, be such a religion! There never was nor ever will be a truly
philosophical mind, whether of Pagan, heathen, Jew, or Christian, but has
followed the same path of thought. Gautama-Buddha is mirrored in the
precepts of Christ; Paul and Philo Judæus are faithful echoes of Plato;
and Ammonius Saccas and Plotinus won their immortal fame by combining
the teachings of all these grand masters of true philosophy. “Prove
all things; hold fast that which is good,” ought to be the motto of all
brothers on earth. Not so is it with the interpreters of the <cite>Bible</cite>. The
seed of the Reformation was sown on the day that the second chapter of
<cite>The Catholic Epistle of James</cite>, jostled the eleventh chapter of the <cite>Epistle
to the Hebrews</cite> in the same <cite>New Testament</cite>. One who believes in Paul
cannot believe in James, Peter, and John. The Paulists, to remain Christians
with their apostle, must withstand Peter “to the face;” and if
Peter “was to be blamed” and <em>was wrong</em>, then he was not infallible.
How then can his successor (?) boast of his infallibility? Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every house divided
against itself must fall. A plurality of masters has proved as fatal in religions
as in politics. What Paul preached, was preached by every other
mystic philosopher. “Stand <em>fast therefore in the liberty</em> wherewith Christ
hath made us free, and <em>be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage</em>!”
exclaims the honest apostle-philosopher; and adds, as if prophetically
inspired: “But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye
be not consumed one of another.”</p>

<p>That the Neo-platonists were not always despised or accused of
demonolatry is evidenced in the adoption by the Roman Church of their
very rites and theurgy. The identical evocations and incantations of the
Pagan and Jewish Kabalist, are now repeated by the Christian exorcist,
and the theurgy of Iamblichus was adopted word for word. “Distinct
as were the Platonists and Pauline Christians of the earlier centuries,”
writes Professor A. Wilder, “many of the more distinguished teachers
of the new faith were deeply tinctured with the philosophical leaven.
Synesius, the Bishop of Cyrene, was the disciple of Hypatia.
 <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony
reiterated the theurgy of Iamblichus.</em> The <i>Logos</i>, or word of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
 <cite>Gospel according to John</cite>, was a Gnostic personification. Clement of Alexandria,
Origen, and others of the fathers drank deeply from the fountains of
philosophy. The ascetic idea which carried away the Church was like
that which was practiced by Plotinus ... all through the middle ages
there rose up men who accepted the interior doctrines which were promulgated
by the renowned teacher of the <span class="lock">Academy.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_117" id="FNanchor_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>To substantiate our accusation that the Latin Church first despoiled
the kabalists and theurgists of their magical rites and ceremonies, before
hurling anathemas upon their devoted heads, we will now translate for
the reader fragments from the forms of <i>exorcism</i> employed by kabalists
and Christians. The identity in phraseology, may, perhaps, disclose one
of the reasons why the Romish Church has always desired to keep the
faithful in ignorance of the meaning of her Latin prayers and ritual. Only
those directly interested in the deception have had the opportunity to
compare the rituals of the Church and the magicians. The best Latin
scholars were, until a comparatively recent date, either churchmen, or
dependent upon the Church. Common people could not read Latin, and
even if they could, the reading of the books on magic was prohibited,
under the penalty of anathema and excommunication. The cunning
device of the confessional made it almost impossible to consult, even
surreptitiously, what the priests call a <i lang="fr">grimoire</i> (a devil’s scrawl), or <cite>Ritual
of Magic</cite>. To make assurance doubly sure, the Church began destroying

<p>It is unnecessary to try the patience of the reader any longer, although
we might multiply examples. It must not be forgotten that we have
quoted from the latest revision of the <cite>Ritual</cite>, that of 1851-2. If we were
to go back to the former one we would find a far more striking identity,
not merely of phraseology but of ceremonial form. For the purpose of
comparison we have not even availed ourselves of the ritual of ceremonial
magic of the <em>Christian</em> kabalists of the middle ages, wherein the
language modelled upon a belief in the divinity of Christ is, with the
exception of a stray expression here and there, identical with the Catholic

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
 <span class="lock">Ritual.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_122" id="FNanchor_122">[122]</a></span>
 The latter, however, makes one improvement, for the originality
of which the Church should be allowed all credit. Certainly nothing so
fantastical could be found in a ritual of magic. “Give place,” apostrophizing
the “Demon,” it says, “give place to Jesus Christ ... thou <em>filthy,
stinking, and ferocious beast</em> ... dost thou rebel? Listen and tremble,
Satan; enemy of the faith, enemy of the human race, introducer of death
... root of all evil, promoter of vice, soul of envy, origin of avarice,
cause of discord, prince of homicide, whom God curses; author of incest
and sacrilege, inventor of all obscenity, <em>professor</em> of the most detestable
actions, <em>and Grand Master of Heretics</em> (<i>!!</i>) (<em>Doctor Hæreticorum!</em>)
What! ... dost thou still stand? Dost dare to resist, and thou knowest
that Christ, our Lord, is coming?... Give place to Jesus Christ, give
place to the Holy Ghost, which, by His blessed Apostle Peter, has flung
thee down before the public, in the person of Simon the Magician”
(<i lang="la">te manifeste stravit in Simone mago</i>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_123" id="FNanchor_123">[123]</a></p>

<p>After such a shower of abuse, no devil having the slightest feeling
of self-respect could remain in such company; unless, indeed, he should
chance to be an Italian Liberal, or King Victor Emmanuel himself;
both of whom, thanks to Pius <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, have become anathema-proof.</p>

<p>It really seems too bad to strip Rome of all her symbols at once; but
justice must be done to the despoiled hierophants. Long before the
sign of the Cross was adopted as a Christian symbol, it was employed as
a secret sign of recognition among neophytes and adepts. Says Levi:
“The sign of the Cross adopted by the Christians does not belong exclusively
to them. It is kabalistic, and represents the oppositions and
quaternary equilibrium of the elements. We see by the occult verse of
the <cite>Pater</cite>, to which we have called attention in another work, that there
were originally two ways of making it, or, at least, two very different
formulas to express its meaning—one reserved for priests and initiates;
the other given to neophytes and the profane. Thus, for example, the
<em>initiate</em>, carrying his hand to his forehead, said: <cite>To thee</cite>; then he added,
<cite>belong</cite>; and continued, while carrying his hand to the breast—<cite>the kingdom</cite>;
then, to the left shoulder—<cite>justice</cite>; to the right shoulder—<cite>and
mercy</cite>. Then he joined the two hands, adding: <cite>throughout the generating
cycles: <span lang="la">‘Tibi sunt Malchut, et Geburah et Chassed per Æonas’</span></cite>—a
sign of the Cross, <em>absolutely</em> and magnificently kabalistic, which the profanations
of Gnosticism made the militant and official Church completely
<em>lose</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_124" id="FNanchor_124">[124]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>How fantastical, therefore, is the assertion of Father Ventura, that,
while Augustine was a Manichean, a philosopher, ignorant of and refusing
to humble himself before the sublimity of the “grand Christian revelation,”
he knew nothing, understood naught of God, man, or universe;
“... he remained poor, small, obscure, sterile, and wrote nothing, did
nothing really grand or useful.” But, hardly had he become a Christian
“... when his reasoning powers and intellect, enlightened at the
<em>luminary of faith</em>, elevated him to the most sublime heights of philosophy
and theology.” And his other proposition that Augustine’s genius, as a
consequence, “developed itself in all its grandeur and prodigious fecundity
... his intellect radiated with that immense splendor which, reflecting
itself in his immortal writings, has never ceased for one moment during
fourteen centuries to illuminate the Church and the <span class="lock">world!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_125" id="FNanchor_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever Augustine was as a Manichean, we leave Father Ventura
to discover; but that his accession to Christianity established an everlasting
enmity between theology and science is beyond doubt. While forced
to confess that “the Gentiles had possibly something <em>divine</em> and true in
their doctrines,” he, nevertheless, declared that for their superstition,
idolatry, and pride, they had “to be detested, and, unless they improved,
to be punished by divine judgment.” This furnishes the clew to the subsequent
policy of the Christian Church, even to our day. If the Gentiles
did not choose to come into the Church, all that was divine in their philosophy
should go for naught, and the divine wrath of God should be visited
upon their heads. What effect this produced is succinctly stated by
Draper: “No one did more than this Father to bring science and
religion into antagonism; it was mainly he who diverted the <cite>Bible</cite> from
its true office—a guide to purity of life—and placed it in the perilous
position of being the arbiter of human knowledge, an audacious tyranny
over the mind of man. The example once set, there was no want of
followers; the works of the Greek philosophers were stigmatized as profane;
the transcendently glorious achievements of the Museum of Alexandria
were hidden from sight by a cloud of ignorance, mysticism, and
unintelligible jargon, out of which there too often flashed the destroying
lightnings of ecclesiastical <span class="lock">vengeance.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_126" id="FNanchor_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>Augustine and
 <span class="lock">Cyprian<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_127" id="FNanchor_127">[127]</a></span>
 admit that Hermes and Hostanes believed
in one true god; the first two maintaining, as well as the two Pagans,
that he is invisible and incomprehensible, except spiritually. Moreover
we invite any man of intelligence—provided he be not a religious fanatic—after
reading fragments chosen at random from the works of Hermes

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
and Augustine on the Deity, to decide which of the two gives a more
philosophical definition of the “unseen Father.” We have at least one
writer of fame who is of our opinion. Draper calls the Augustinian
productions a “rhapsodical conversation” with God; an “incoherent
<span class="lock">dream.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_128" id="FNanchor_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Ventura depicts the saint as attitudinizing before an astonished
world upon “the most sublime heights of philosophy.” But here steps
in again the same unprejudiced critic, who passes the following remarks
on this colossus of Patristic philosophy. “Was it for this preposterous
scheme,” he asks, “this product of ignorance and audacity, that the
works of the Greek philosophers were to be given up? It was none too
soon that the great critics who appeared at the Reformation, by comparing
the works of these writers with one another, brought them to their
proper level, and taught us to look upon them all with
 <span class="lock">contempt.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_129" id="FNanchor_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>For such men as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, Apollonius, and
even Simon Magus, to be accused of having formed a pact with the
Devil, whether the latter personage exist or not, is so absurd as to need
but little refutation. If Simon Magus—the most problematical of all in
an historical sense—ever existed otherwise than in the overheated fancy
of Peter and the other apostles, he was evidently no worse than any of
his adversaries. A difference in religious views, however great, is insufficient
<i lang="la">per se</i> to send one person to heaven and the other to hell. Such
uncharitable and peremptory doctrines might have been taught in the
middle ages; but it is too late now for even the Church to put forward
this traditional scarecrow. Research begins to suggest that which, if
ever verified, will bring eternal disgrace on the Church of the Apostle
Peter, whose very imposition of herself upon that disciple must be regarded
as the most unverified and unverifiable of the assumptions of the
Catholic clergy.</p>

<p>The erudite author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> assiduously endeavors
to prove that by <em>Simon Magus</em> we must understand the apostle Paul,
whose Epistles were secretly as well as openly calumniated by Peter,
and charged with containing “<em>dysnoëtic</em> learning.” The Apostle of the
Gentiles was brave, outspoken, sincere, and very learned; the Apostle
of Circumcision, cowardly, cautious, <em>insincere</em>, and very ignorant. That
Paul had been, partially, at least, if not completely, initiated into the
theurgic mysteries, admits of little doubt. His language, the phraseology
so peculiar to the Greek philosophers, certain expressions used but by the
initiates, are so many sure ear-marks to that supposition. Our suspicion
has been strengthened by an able article in one of the New York periodicals,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
entitled <cite>Paul and Plato</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_130" id="FNanchor_130">[130]</a>
 in which the author puts forward one
remarkable and, for us, very precious observation. In his <cite>Epistles to the
Corinthians</cite> he shows Paul abounding with “expressions suggested by
the initiations of Sabazius and Eleusis, and the lectures of the (Greek)
philosophers. He (Paul) designates himself an <em>idiotes</em>—a person unskilful
in the Word, but not in the <em>gnosis</em> or philosophical learning. ‘We
speak wisdom among the perfect or initiated,’ he writes; ‘not the wisdom
of this world, nor of the archons of this world, but divine wisdom
in a mystery, secret—which <em>none of the Archons of this world knew</em>.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_131" id="FNanchor_131">[131]</a></p>

<p>What else can the apostle mean by these unequivocal words, but
that he himself, as belonging to the <em>mystæ</em> (initiated), spoke of things
shown and explained only in the Mysteries? The “divine wisdom in a
mystery which none of the <em>archons of this world knew</em>,” has evidently
some direct reference to the <em>basileus</em> of the Eleusinian initiation who
<em>did know</em>. The <em>basileus</em> belonged to the staff of the great hierophant,
and was an <em>archon</em> of Athens; and as such was one of the chief <i>mystæ</i>,
belonging to the <em>interior</em> Mysteries, to which a very select and small
number obtained an
 <span class="lock">entrance.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_132" id="FNanchor_132">[132]</a></span>
 The magistrates supervising the Eleusinians
were called archons.</p>

<p>Another proof that Paul belonged to the circle of the “Initiates” lies
in the following fact. The apostle had his head shorn at Cenchrea
(where Lucius, <i>Apuleius</i>, was initiated) because “he had a vow.” The
<i>nazars</i>—or set apart—as we see in the Jewish Scriptures, had to cut
their hair which they wore long, and which “no razor touched” at any
other time, and sacrifice it on the altar of initiation. And the nazars
were a class of Chaldean theurgists. We will show further that Jesus
belonged to this class.</p>

<p>Paul declares that: “According to the grace of God which is given
unto me, as a wise <em>master-builder</em>, I have laid the <span class="lock">foundation.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_133" id="FNanchor_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>This expression, master-builder, used only <em>once</em> in the whole <cite>Bible</cite>,
and by Paul, may be considered as a whole revelation. In the Mysteries,
the third part of the sacred rites was called <cite>Epopteia</cite>, or revelation, reception
into the secrets. In substance it means that stage of divine clairvoyance
when everything pertaining to this earth disappears, and earthly sight
is paralyzed, and the soul is united free and pure with its Spirit, or God.
But the real significance of the word is “overseeing,” from οπτομαι—<i>I
see myself</i>. In Sanscrit the word <i>evâpto</i> has the same meaning,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
as well as <i>to obtain</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_134" id="FNanchor_134">[134]</a>
 The word <i>epopteia</i> is a compound one, from <a id="Greekch1"></a>Επι—upon,
and οπτομαι—to look, or an overseer, an inspector—also used
for a master-builder. The title of master-mason, in Freemasonry, is
derived from this, in the sense used in the Mysteries. Therefore, when
Paul entitles himself a “master-builder,” he is using a word pre-eminently
kabalistic, theurgic, and masonic, and one which no other apostle uses.
He thus declares himself an <em>adept</em>, having the right to <em>initiate</em> others.</p>

<p>If we search in this direction, with those sure guides, the Grecian
Mysteries and the <cite>Kabala</cite>, before us, it will be easy to find the secret reason
why Paul was so persecuted and hated by Peter, John, and James. The
author of the <cite>Revelation</cite> was a Jewish kabalist <i lang="fr">pur sang</i>, with all the
hatred inherited by him from his forefathers toward the
 <span class="lock">Mysteries.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_135" id="FNanchor_135">[135]</a></span>
 His
jealousy during the life of Jesus extended even to Peter; and it is but
after the death of their common master that we see the two apostles—the
former of whom wore the Mitre and the Petaloon of the Jewish
Rabbis—preach so zealously the rite of circumcision. In the eyes of
Peter, Paul, who had humiliated him, and whom he felt so much his
superior in “Greek learning” and philosophy, must have naturally
appeared as a magician, a man polluted with the “<i>Gnosis</i>,” with the
“wisdom” of the Greek Mysteries—hence, perhaps,
 <span class="lock">“Simon<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_136" id="FNanchor_136">[136]</a></span>
 the Magician.”</p>

<p>As to Peter, biblical criticism has shown before now that he had
probably no more to do with the foundation of the Latin Church at
Rome, than to furnish the pretext so readily seized upon by the cunning
Irenæus to benefit this Church with the new name of the apostle—<i>Petra</i>
or <i>Kiffa</i>, a name which allowed so readily, by an easy play upon
words, to connect it with <i>Petroma</i>, the double set of stone tablets used

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
by the hierophant at the initiations, during the final Mystery. In this,
perhaps, lies concealed the whole secret of the claims of the Vatican.
As Professor Wilder happily suggests: “In the Oriental countries the
designation פתר, Peter (in Phœnician and Chaldaic, an interpreter)
appears to have been the title of this personage (the hierophant)....
There is in these facts some reminder of the peculiar circumstances of the
Mosaic Law ... and also of the claim of the Pope to be the successor
of Peter, the hierophant or interpreter of the Christian <span class="lock">religion.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_137" id="FNanchor_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>As such, we must concede to him, to some extent, the right to be
such an interpreter. The Latin Church has faithfully preserved in
symbols, rites, ceremonies, architecture, and even in the very dress of her
clergy, the tradition of the Pagan worship—of the public or exoteric
ceremonies, we should add; otherwise her dogmas would embody more
sense and contain less blasphemy against the majesty of the Supreme
and Invisible God.</p>

<p>An inscription found on the coffin of Queen Mentuhept, of the eleventh
dynasty (2250 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), now proved to have been transcribed from the
seventeenth chapter of the <cite>Book of the Dead</cite> (dating not later than
4500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), is more than suggestive. This monumental text contains a
group of hieroglyphics, which, when interpreted, read thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="sansserif"><b>PTR.</b>  <b>RF.</b>  <b>SU.</b></span><br>
Peter-   ref-   su.<br>
</p>

<p>Baron Bunsen shows this sacred formulary mixed up with a whole
series of glosses and various interpretations on a monument forty centuries
old. “This is identical with saying that the record (the true interpretation)
was at that time no longer intelligible.... We beg our
readers to understand,” he adds, “that a sacred text, a hymn, containing
the words of a departed spirit, existed in such a state about 4,000
years ago ... as to be all but unintelligible to royal <span class="lock">scribes.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_138" id="FNanchor_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>That it was unintelligible to the uninitiated among the latter is as well
proved by the confused and contradictory glossaries, as that it was a
“mystery”-word, known to the hierophants of the sanctuaries, and, moreover,
a word chosen by Jesus, to designate the office assigned by him to
one of his apostles. This word, PTR, was partially interpreted, owing
to another word similarly written in another group of hieroglyphics, on a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
stele, the sign used for it being an opened
 <span class="lock">eye.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_139" id="FNanchor_139">[139]</a></span>
 Bunsen mentions as
another explanation of PTR—“to show.” “It appears to me,” he remarks,
“that our PTR is literally the old Aramaic and Hebrew ‘Patar’,
which occurs in the history of Joseph as the specific word for <em>interpreting</em>;
whence also <em>Pitrum</em> is the term for interpretation of a text, a
 <span class="lock">dream.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_140" id="FNanchor_140">[140]</a></span>
 In a manuscript of the first century, a combination of the
Demotic and Greek
 <span class="lock">texts,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_141" id="FNanchor_141">[141]</a></span>
 and most probably one of the few which
miraculously escaped the Christian vandalism of the second and third
centuries, when all such precious manuscripts were burned as magical,
we find occurring in several places a phrase, which, perhaps, may throw
some light upon this question. One of the principal heroes of the manuscript,
who is constantly referred to as “the Judean Illuminator” or
Initiate, Τελειωτὴς, is made to communicate but with his <i>Patar</i>; the
latter being written in Chaldaic characters. Once the latter word is
coupled with the name <i>Shimeon</i>. Several times, the “Illuminator,” who
rarely breaks his contemplative solitude, is shown inhabiting a Κρύπτη
(cave), and teaching the multitudes of eager scholars standing outside, not
orally, but through this <i>Patar</i>. The latter receives the words of wisdom
by applying his ear to a circular hole in a partition which conceals the
teacher from the listeners, and then conveys them, with explanations and
glossaries, to the crowd. This, with a slight change, was the method
used by Pythagoras, who, as we know, never allowed his neophytes to
see him during the years of probation, but instructed them from behind
a curtain in his cave.</p>

<p>But, whether the “Illuminator” of the Græco-Demotic manuscript
is identical with Jesus or not, the fact remains, that we find him selecting
a “mystery”-appellation for one who is made to appear later by the
Catholic Church as the janitor of the Kingdom of Heaven and the interpreter
of Christ’s will. The word Patar or Peter locates both master and
disciple in the circle of initiation, and connects them with the “Secret
Doctrine.” The great hierophant of the ancient Mysteries never allowed
the candidates to see or hear him personally. He was the <span lang="la">Deus-ex-Machina</span>,
the presiding but invisible Deity, uttering his will and instructions
through a second party; and 2,000 years later, we discover that the
Dalaï-Lamas of Thibet had been following for centuries the same traditional
programme during the most important religious mysteries of lamaism.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
If Jesus knew the secret meaning of the title bestowed by him on Simon,
then he must have been initiated; otherwise he could not have learned
it; and if he was an initiate of either the Pythagorean Essenes, the Chaldean
Magi, or the Egyptian Priests, then the doctrine taught by him was
but a portion of the “Secret Doctrine” taught by the Pagan hierophants
to the few select adepts admitted within the sacred adyta.</p>

<p>But we will discuss this question further on. For the present we will
endeavor to briefly indicate the extraordinary similarity—or rather identity,
we should say—of rites and ceremonial dress of the Christian clergy
with that of the old Babylonians, Assyrians, Phœnicians, Egyptians, and
other Pagans of the hoary antiquity.</p>

<p>If we would find the model of the Papal tiara, we must search the
annals of the ancient Assyrian tablets. We invite the reader to give his
attention to Dr. Inman’s illustrated work, <cite>Ancient Pagan and Modern
Christian Symbolism</cite>. On page sixty-four, he will readily recognize the
head-gear of the successor of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter in the coiffure worn by gods or
angels in ancient Assyria, “where it appears crowned by an emblem of
the <em>male</em> trinity” (the Christian Cross). “We may mention, in passing,”
adds Dr. Inman, “that, as the Romanists adopted the mitre and the
tiara from ‘the cursed brood of Ham,’ so they adopted the Episcopalian
crook from the augurs of Etruria, and the artistic form with which they
clothe their angels from the painters and urn-makers of Magna Grecia and
Central Italy.”</p>

<p>Would we push our inquiries farther, and seek to ascertain as much
in relation to the nimbus and the tonsure of the Catholic priest and
 <span class="lock">monk?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_142" id="FNanchor_142">[142]</a></span>
 We shall find undeniable proofs that they are solar emblems.
Knight, in his <cite>Old England Pictorially Illustrated</cite>, gives a drawing by
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine, representing an ancient Christian bishop, in a dress probably
identical with that worn by the great “saint” himself. The <i>pallium</i>,
or the ancient stole of the bishop, is the feminine sign when worn by a
priest in worship. On <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine’s picture it is bedecked with Buddhistic
crosses, and in its whole appearance it is a representation of the
Egyptian <b class="sansserif larger">T</b> (tau), assuming slightly the figure
 of the letter <b class="sansserif larger">Y</b>. “Its
lower end is the mark of the masculine triad,” says Inman; “the right
hand (of the figure) has the forefinger extended, like the Assyrian priests
while doing homage <em>to the grove</em>.... When a male dons the pallium in
worship, he becomes the representative of the trinity in the unity, the
<i>arba</i>, or mystic <span class="lock">four.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_143" id="FNanchor_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“Immaculate is our Lady Isis,” is the legend around an engraving

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
of Serapis and Isis, described by King, in <cite>The Gnostics and their Remains</cite>,
Ἡ ΚΥΡΙΑ ΙϹΙϹ ΑΓΝΗ “... the very terms applied afterwards to
that personage (the Virgin Mary) who succeeded to her form, titles, symbols,
rites, and ceremonies.... Thus, her devotees carried into the new
priesthood the former badges of their profession, the obligation to celibacy,
the tonsure, and the surplice, omitting, unfortunately, the frequent
ablutions prescribed by the ancient creed.” “The ‘Black Virgins,’ so
highly reverenced in certain French cathedrals ... proved, when at last
critically examined, basalt figures of <span class="lock">Isis!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_144" id="FNanchor_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the shrine of Jupiter Ammon were suspended tinkling bells,
from the sound of whose chiming the priests gathered the auguries; “A
golden bell and a pomegranate ... round about the hem of the robe,”
was the result with the Mosaic Jews. But in the Buddhistic system, during
the religious services, the gods of the Deva Loka are always invoked,
and invited to descend upon the altars by the ringing of bells suspended
in the pagodas. The bell of the sacred table of Siva at Kuhama is
described in Kailasa, and every Buddhist vihara and lamasery has its
bells.</p>

<p>We thus see that the bells used by Christians come to them directly
from the Buddhist Thibetans and Chinese. The beads and rosaries have
the same origin, and have been used by Buddhist monks for over 2,300
years. The <i>Linghams</i> in the Hindu temples are ornamented upon certain
days with large berries, from a tree sacred to Mahadeva, which are strung
into rosaries. The title of “nun” is an Egyptian word, and had with them
the actual meaning; the Christians did not even take the trouble of translating
the word <i>Nonna</i>. The aureole of the saints was used by the antediluvian
artists of Babylonia, whenever they desired to honor or deify a
mortal’s head. In a celebrated picture in Moore’s <cite>Hindoo Pantheon</cite>, entitled,
“Christna nursed by Devaki, from a highly-finished picture,” the
Hindu Virgin is represented as seated on a lounge and nursing Christna.
The hair brushed back, the long veil, and the golden aureole around the
Virgin’s head, as well as around that of the Hindu Saviour, are striking.
No Catholic, well versed as he might be in the mysterious symbolism
of iconology, would hesitate for a moment to worship at that shrine the
Virgin Mary, the mother of his
 <span class="lock">God!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_145" id="FNanchor_145">[145]</a></span>
 In Indur Subba, the south
entrance of the Caves of Ellora, may be seen to this day the figure of
Indra’s wife, Indranee, sitting with her infant son-god, pointing the finger
to heaven with the same gesture as the Italian Madonna and child.
In <cite>Pagan and Christian Symbolism</cite>, the author gives a figure from a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
mediæval woodcut—the like of which we have seen by dozens in old
psalters—in which the Virgin Mary, with her infant, is represented as
the Queen of Heaven, on the crescent moon, emblem of virginity.
“Being before the sun, she almost eclipses its light. Than this, nothing
could more completely identify the Christian mother and child with Isis
and Horus, Ishtar, Venus, Juno, and a host of other Pagan goddesses,
who have been called ‘Queen of Heaven,’ ‘Queen of the Universe,’
‘Mother of God,’ ‘Spouse of God,’ ‘the Celestial Virgin,’ ‘the Heavenly
Peace-Maker,’ <span class="lock">etc.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_146" id="FNanchor_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Such pictures are not purely astronomical. They represent the male
god and the female goddess, as the sun and moon in conjunction, “the
union of the triad with the unit.” The horns of the cow on the head of
Isis have the same significance.</p>

<p>And so above, below, outside, and inside, the Christian Church, in
the priestly garments, and the religious rites, we recognize the stamp of
exoteric heathenism. On no subject within the wide range of human
knowledge, has the world been more blinded or deceived with such persistent
misrepresentation as on that of antiquity. Its hoary past and its
religious faiths have been misrepresented and trampled under the feet of
its successors. Its hierophants and prophets, mystæ and
 <span class="lock">epoptæ,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_147" id="FNanchor_147">[147]</a></span>
 of the
once sacred adyta of the temple shown as demoniacs and devil-worshippers.
Donned in the despoiled garments of the victim, the Christian priest now
anathematizes the latter with rites and ceremonies which he has learned
from the theurgists themselves. The Mosaic <cite>Bible</cite> is used as a weapon
against the people who furnished it. The heathen philosopher is cursed
under the very roof which has witnessed his initiation; and the “monkey
of God” (<i>i.e.</i>, the devil of Tertullian), “the originator and founder of
magical theurgy, the science of illusions and lies, whose father and author
is the demon,” is exorcised with holy water by the hand which holds the
identical
 <span class="lock"><i>lituus</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_148" id="FNanchor_148">[148]</a></span>
 with which the ancient augur, after a solemn prayer,
used to determine the regions of heaven, and evoke, in the name of the
<span class="allsmcap">HIGHEST</span>, the minor god (now termed the Devil), who unveiled to his eyes
futurity, and enabled him to prophesy! On the part of the Christians
and the clergy it is nothing but shameful ignorance, prejudice, and that
contemptible pride so boldly denounced by one of their own reverend
ministers, T.
 <span class="lock">Gross,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_149" id="FNanchor_149">[149]</a></span>
 which rails against all investigation “as a useless
or a criminal labor, when it must be feared that they will result in the
overthrow of preëstablished systems of faith.” On the part of the scholars
it is the same apprehension of the possible necessity of having to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">97</a></span>
modify some of their erroneously-established theories of science. “Nothing
but such pitiable prejudice,” says Gross, “can have thus misrepresented
the theology of heathenism, and distorted—nay, caricatured—its
forms of religious worship. It is time that posterity should raise its voice
in vindication of violated truth, and that the present age should learn a
little of that common sense of which it boasts with as much self-complacency
as if the prerogative of reason was the birthright only of modern
times.”</p>

<p>All this gives a sure clew to the real cause of the hatred felt by the
early and mediæval Christian toward his Pagan brother and dangerous
rival. We hate but what we fear. The Christian thaumaturgist once
having broken all association with the Mysteries of the temples and with
“these schools so renowned for magic,” described by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
 <span class="lock">Hilarion,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_150" id="FNanchor_150">[150]</a></span>
 could
certainly expect but little to rival the Pagan wonder-workers. No
apostle, with the exception perhaps of healing by mesmeric power, has
ever equalled Apollonius of Tyana; and the scandal created among the
apostles by the miracle-doing Simon Magus, is too notorious to be repeated
here again. “How is it,” asks Justin Martyr, in evident dismay,
“how is it that the talismans of Apollonius (the τελεσματα) have power
in certain members of creation, for they prevent, <em>as we see</em>, the fury of
the waves, and the violence of the winds, and the attacks of wild beasts;
and whilst our Lord’s miracles are preserved by tradition alone, those of
Apollonius <em>are most numerous</em>, and actually manifested in present facts,
so as to lead astray all
 <span class="lock">beholders?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_151" id="FNanchor_151">[151]</a></span>
 This perplexed martyr solves the
problem by attributing very correctly the efficacy and potency of the
charms used by Apollonius to his profound knowledge of the sympathies
and antipathies (or repugnances) of nature.</p>

<p>Unable to deny the evident superiority of their enemies’ powers, the
fathers had recourse to the old but ever successful method—that of
slander. They honored the theurgists with the same insinuating calumny
that had been resorted to by the Pharisees against Jesus. “Thou hast a
dæmon,” the elders of the Jewish Synagogue had said to him. “Thou
hast the Devil,” repeated the cunning fathers, with equal truth, addressing
the Pagan thaumaturgist; and the widely-bruited charge, erected
later into an article of faith, won the day.</p>

<p>But the modern heirs of these ecclesiastical falsifiers, who charge
magic, spiritualism, and even magnetism with being produced by a demon,
forget or perhaps never read the classics. None of our bigots has ever
looked with more scorn on the <em>abuses</em> of magic than did the true initiate

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of old. No modern or even mediæval law could be more severe than
that of the hierophant. True, he had more discrimination, charity, and
justice, than the Christian clergy; for while banishing the “unconscious”
sorcerer, the person troubled with a demon, from within the sacred precincts
of the adyta, the priests, instead of mercilessly burning him, took
care of the unfortunate “possessed one.” Having hospitals expressly
for that purpose in the neighborhood of temples, the ancient “medium,”
if obsessed, was taken care of and restored to health. But with one
who had, by conscious <em>witchcraft</em>, acquired powers dangerous to his fellow-creatures,
the priests of old were as severe as justice herself. “Any person
<em>accidentally</em> guilty of homicide, or of any crime, or convicted of
<em>witchcraft</em>, was excluded from the Eleusinian
 <span class="lock">Mysteries.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_152" id="FNanchor_152">[152]</a></span>
 And so were
they from all others. This law, mentioned by all writers on the ancient
initiation, speaks for itself. The claim of Augustine, that all the explanations
given by the Neo-platonists were invented by themselves is absurd.
For nearly every ceremony in their true and successive order is given by
Plato himself, in a more or less covered way. The Mysteries are as old
as the world, and one well versed in the esoteric mythologies of various
nations can trace them back to the days of the ante-Vedic period in
India. A condition of the strictest virtue and purity is required from the
<i>Vatou</i>, or candidate in India before he can become an initiate, whether
he aims to be a simple fakir, a <i>Purohita</i> (public priest) or a <i>Sannyâsi</i>,
a saint of the second degree of initiation, the most holy as the most
revered of them all. After having conquered, in the terrible trials preliminary
to admittance to the inner temple in the subterranean crypts of
his pagoda, the sannyâsi passes the rest of his life in the temple, practicing
the eighty-four rules and ten virtues prescribed to the Yogis.</p>

<p>“No one who has not practiced, during his whole life, the ten virtues
which the divine Manu makes incumbent as a duty, can be initiated into
the Mysteries of the council,” say the Hindu books of initiation.</p>

<p>These virtues are: “Resignation; the act of rendering good for evil;
temperance; probity; purity; chastity; repression of the physical
senses; the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; that of the <em>Superior</em>
soul (spirit); worship of truth; abstinence from anger.” These virtues
must alone direct the life of a true Yogi. “No unworthy adept ought
to defile the ranks of the holy initiates by his presence for twenty-four
hours.” The adept becomes guilty after having once broken any one
of these vows. Surely the exercise of such virtues is inconsistent with
the idea one has of <em>devil</em>-worship and lasciviousness of purpose!</p>

<p>And now we will try to give a clear insight into one of the chief objects

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of this work. What we desire to prove is, that underlying every
ancient popular religion was the same ancient wisdom-doctrine, one and
identical, professed and practiced by the initiates of every country,
who alone were aware of its existence and importance. To ascertain
its origin, and the precise age in which it was matured, is now beyond
human possibility. A single glance, however, is enough to assure one
that it could not have attained the marvellous perfection in which we
find it pictured to us in the relics of the various esoteric systems, except
after a succession of ages. A philosophy so profound, a moral code so
ennobling, and practical results so conclusive and so uniformly demonstrable
is not the growth of a generation, or even a single epoch. Fact
must have been piled upon fact, deduction upon deduction, science have
begotten science, and myriads of the brightest human intellects have reflected
upon the laws of nature, before this ancient doctrine had taken concrete
shape. The proofs of this identity of fundamental doctrine in the
old religions are found in the prevalence of a system of initiation; in
the secret sacerdotal castes who had the guardianship of mystical words
of power, and a public display of a phenomenal control over natural
forces, indicating association with preterhuman beings. Every approach
to the Mysteries of all these nations was guarded with the same jealous
care, and in all, the penalty of death was inflicted upon initiates of any
degree who divulged the secrets entrusted to them. We have seen that
such was the case in the Eleusinian and Bacchic Mysteries, among the
Chaldean Magi, and the Egyptian hierophants; while with the Hindus,
from whom they were all derived, the same rule has prevailed from time immemorial.
We are left in no doubt upon this point; for the <cite>Agrushada
Parikshai</cite> says explicitly, “Every initiate, to whatever degree he may
belong, who reveals the great sacred formula, must be put to death.”</p>

<p>Naturally enough, this same extreme penalty was prescribed in all the
multifarious sects and brotherhoods which at different periods have sprung
from the ancient stock. We find it with the early Essenes, Gnostics,
theurgic Neo-platonists, and mediæval philosophers; and in our day, even
the Masons perpetuate the memory of the old obligations in the penalties
of throat-cutting, dismemberment, and disemboweling, with which the
candidate is threatened. As the Masonic “master’s word” is communicated
only at “low breath,” so the selfsame precaution is prescribed in
the Chaldean <cite>Book of Numbers</cite> and the Jewish <cite>Mercaba</cite>. When initiated,
the neophyte was led by an <em>ancient</em> to a secluded spot, and there the
latter whispered <em>in his ear</em> the great
 <span class="lock">secret.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_153" id="FNanchor_153">[153]</a></span>
 The Mason swears, under
the most frightful penalties, that he will not communicate the secrets of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
any degree “to a brother of an <em>inferior degree</em>;” and the <cite>Agrushada
Parikshai</cite> says: “Any initiate of the third degree who reveals before
the prescribed time, to the initiates of the second degree, the superior
truths, must be put to death.” Again, the Masonic apprentice consents
to have his “tongue torn out by the roots” if he divulge anything to a
profane; and in the Hindu books of initiation, the same <cite>Agrushada
Parikshai</cite>, we find that any initiate of the first degree (the lowest) who
betrays the secrets of his initiation, to members of other castes, for whom
the science should be a closed book, must have “his <em>tongue cut out</em>,” and
suffer other mutilations.</p>

<p>As we proceed, we will point out the evidences of this identity of
vows, formulas, rites, and doctrines, between the ancient faiths. We will
also show that not only their memory is still preserved in India, but also
that the Secret Association is still alive and as active as ever. That, after
reading what we have to say, it may be inferred that the chief pontiff and
hierophant, the <i>Brahmâtma</i>, is still accessible to those “who know,”
though perhaps recognized by another name; and that the ramifications
of his influence extend throughout the world. But we will now return
again to the early Christian period.</p>

<p>As though he were not aware that there was any esoteric significance
to the exoteric symbols, and that the Mysteries themselves were composed
of two parts, the lesser at Agræ, and the higher ones at Eleusinia, Clemens
Alexandrinus, with a rancorous bigotry that one might expect from
a renegade Neo-platonist, but is astonished to find in this generally honest
and learned Father, stigmatized the Mysteries as indecent and diabolical.
Whatever were the rites enacted among the neophytes before they passed
to a higher form of instruction; however misunderstood were the trials
of <i>Katharsis</i> or purification, during which they were submitted to every
kind of probation; and however much the immaterial or physical aspect
might have led to calumny, it is but wicked prejudice which can compel
a person to say that under this external meaning there was not a far
deeper and spiritual significance.</p>

<p>It is positively absurd to judge the ancients from our own standpoint
of propriety and virtue. And most assuredly it is not for the Church—which
now stands accused by all the modern symbologists of having
adopted precisely these same emblems in their coarsest aspect, and feels
herself powerless to refute the accusations—to throw the stone at those
who were her models. When men like Pythagoras, Plato, and Iamblichus,
renowned for their severe morality, took part in the Mysteries, and
spoke of them with veneration, it ill behooves our modern critics to judge
them so rashly upon their merely external aspect. Iamblichus explains
the worst; and his explanation, for an unprejudiced mind, ought to be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
perfectly plausible. “Exhibitions of this kind,” he says, “in the Mysteries
were designed to free us from licentious passions, by gratifying the
sight, and at the same time vanquishing all evil thought, through <em>the awful
sanctity</em> with which these rites were accompanied.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_154" id="FNanchor_154">[154]</a> “The wisest and
best men in the Pagan world,” adds Dr. Warburton, “are unanimous in
this, that the Mysteries were instituted pure, and proposed the noblest
ends by the worthiest <span class="lock">means.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_155" id="FNanchor_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>In these celebrated rites, although persons of both sexes and all
classes were allowed to take a part, and a participation in them was even
obligatory, very few indeed attained the higher and final initiation. The
gradation of the Mysteries is given us by Proclus in the fourth book of his
<cite>Theology of Plato</cite>. “The perfective rite τελετη, precedes in order the
initiation—<i>Muesis</i>—and the initiation, <i>Epopteia</i>, or the final apocalypse
(revelation).” Theon of Smyrna, in <cite>Mathematica</cite>, also divides the mystic
rites into five parts: “the first of which is the previous purification;
for <em>neither are the Mysteries communicated to all</em> who are willing to receive
them; ... there are certain persons who are prevented by the
voice of the crier (κηρυξ) ... since it is necessary that such as are not
expelled from the Mysteries should first be refined by certain purifications
which the reception of the sacred rites succeeds. The third part is denominated
<i>epopteia</i> or reception. And the fourth, which is the end and
design of the revelation, is <em>the binding of the head and fixing of the
crowns</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_156" id="FNanchor_156">[156]</a>
 ... whether after this he (the initiated person) becomes ...
an hierophant or sustains some other part of the sacerdotal office. But
the fifth, which is produced from all these, <em>is friendship and interior
communion with God</em>.” And this was the last and most awful of all the
Mysteries.</p>

<p>There are writers who have often wondered at the meaning of this
claim to a “friendship and interior communion with God.” Christian
authors have denied the pretensions of the “Pagans” to such “communion,”
affirming that only Christian saints were and are capable of enjoying
it; materialistic skeptics have altogether scoffed at the idea of both.
After long ages of religious materialism and spiritual stagnation, it has
most certainly become difficult if not altogether impossible to substantiate
the claims of either party. The old Greeks, who had once crowded

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
around the Agora of Athens, with its altar to the “Unknown God,” are
no more; and their descendants firmly believe that they have found the
“Unknown” in the Jewish Jehova. The divine ecstasies of the early
Christians have made room for visions of a more modern character, in
perfect keeping with progress and civilization. The “Son of man” appearing
to the rapt vision of the ancient Christian as coming from the
seventh heaven, in a cloud of glory, and surrounded with angels and
winged seraphim, has made room for a more prosaic and at the same
time more business-like Jesus. The latter is now shown as making morning
calls upon Mary and Martha in Bethany; as seating himself on “the
<em>ottoman</em>” with the younger sister, a lover of “ethics,” while Martha goes
off to the kitchen to cook. Anon the heated fancy of a blasphemous
Brooklyn preacher and harlequin, the Reverend Dr. Talmage, makes us
see her rushing back “with besweated brow, a pitcher in one hand and
the tongs in the other ... into the presence of Christ,” and blowing him
up for not caring that her sister hath left her “to serve <span class="lock">alone.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_157" id="FNanchor_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>From the birth of the solemn and majestic conception of the unrevealed
Deity of the ancient adepts to such caricatured descriptions of
him who died on the Cross for his philanthropic devotion to humanity,
long centuries have intervened, and their heavy tread seems to have
almost entirely obliterated all sense of a spiritual religion from the hearts
of his professed followers. No wonder then, that the sentence of Proclus
is no longer understood by the Christians, and is rejected as a “vagary”
by the materialists, who, in their negation, are less blasphemous and
atheistical than many of the reverends and members of the churches.
But, although the Greek <i>epoptai</i> are no more, we have now, in our own
age, a people far more ancient than the oldest Hellenes, who practice
the so-called “preterhuman” gifts to the same extent as did their ancestors
far earlier than the days of Troy. It is to this people that we draw
the attention of the psychologist and philosopher.</p>

<p>One need not go very deep into the literature of the Orientalists to
become convinced that in most cases they do not even suspect that in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the arcane philosophy of India there are depths which they have not
sounded, and <em>cannot</em> sound, for they pass on without perceiving them.
There is a pervading tone of conscious superiority, a ring of contempt in
the treatment of Hindu metaphysics, as though the European mind is
alone enlightened enough to polish the rough diamond of the old Sanscrit
writers, and separate right from wrong for the benefit of their descendants.
We see them disputing over the external forms of expression
without a conception of the great vital truths these hide from the profane
view.</p>

<p>“As a rule, the Brahmans,” says Jacolliot, “rarely go beyond the
class of <i>grihesta</i> [priests of the vulgar castes] and <i>purohita</i> [exorcisers,
divines, prophets, and evocators of spirits]. And yet, we shall see ...
once that we have touched upon the question and study of manifestations
and phenomena, that these initiates of the <em>first</em> degree (the lowest) attribute
to themselves, and in appearance possess faculties developed to a
degree which has never been equalled in Europe. As to the initiates of
the second and especially of the third category, they pretend to be
enabled to ignore time, space, and to command life and <span class="lock">death.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_158" id="FNanchor_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Such initiates as these M. Jacolliot <em>did not meet</em>; for, as he says himself,
they only appear on the most solemn occasions, and when the faith
of the multitudes has to be strengthened by phenomena of a superior
order. “They are never seen, either in the neighborhood of, or even inside
the temples, except at the grand quinquennial festival of the fire.
On that occasion, they appear about the middle of the night, on a platform
erected in the centre of the sacred lake, like so many phantoms,
and by their conjurations they illumine the space. A fiery column of
light ascends from around them, rushing from earth to heaven. Unfamiliar
sounds vibrate through the air, and five or six hundred thousand
Hindus, gathered from every part of India to contemplate these demigods,
throw themselves with their faces buried in the dust, invoking the
souls of their <span class="lock">ancestors.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_159" id="FNanchor_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Let any impartial person read the <cite lang="fr">Spiritisme dans le Monde</cite>, and he
cannot believe that this “implacable rationalist,” as Jacolliot takes pride
in terming himself, said one word more than is warranted by what he had
seen. His statements support and are corroborated by those of other
skeptics. As a rule, the missionaries, even after passing half a lifetime
in the country of “devil-worship,” as they call India, either disingenuously
<em>deny</em> altogether what they cannot help knowing to be true, or
ridiculously attribute phenomena to this power of the Devil, that outrival
the “miracles” of the apostolic ages. And what do we see this French

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
author, notwithstanding his incorrigible rationalism, forced to admit,
after having narrated the greatest wonders? Watch the fakirs as he
would, he is compelled to bear the strongest testimony to their perfect
honesty in the matter of their miraculous phenomena. “Never,” he
says, “have we succeeded in detecting a single one in the act of deceit.”
One fact should be noted by all who, without having been in India, still
fancy they are clever enough to expose the fraud of <em>pretended</em> magicians.
This skilled and cool observer, this redoubtable materialist, after his
long sojourn in India, affirms, “We unhesitatingly avow that we have not
met, either in India or in Ceylon, a single European, even among the oldest
residents, who has been able to indicate the means employed by these
devotees for the production of these phenomena!”</p>

<p>And how should they? Does not this zealous Orientalist confess to
us that even he, who had every available means at hand to learn many of
their rites and doctrines at first hand, failed in his attempts to make the
Brahmans explain to him their secrets. “All that our most diligent inquiries
of the Pourohitas could elicit from them respecting the acts of their
superiors (the invisible initiates of the temples), amounts to very little.”
And again, speaking of one of the books, he confesses that, while purporting
to reveal all that is desirable to know, it “falls back into mysterious
formulas, in combinations of magical and occult letters, the secret of
which it has been impossible for us to penetrate,” etc.</p>

<p>The fakirs, although they can never reach beyond the first degree of
initiation, are, notwithstanding, the only agents between the living world
and the “silent brothers,” or those initiates who never cross the thresholds
of their sacred dwellings. The Fūkara-Yogis belong to the temples,
and who knows but these cenobites of the sanctuary have far more
to do with the psychological phenomena which attend the fakirs, and
have been so graphically described by Jacolliot, than the <i>Pitris</i> themselves?
Who can tell but that the fluidic spectre of the ancient Brahman
seen by Jacolliot was the Scin-lecca, the spiritual <em>double</em>, of one of these
mysterious sannyâsi?</p>

<p>Although the story has been translated and commented upon by Professor
Perty, of Geneva, still we will venture to give it in Jacolliot’s own
words: “A moment after the disappearance of the hands, the fakir continuing
his evocations (<i>mantras</i>) more earnestly than ever, a cloud like
the first, but more opalescent and more opaque, began to hover near
the small brasier, which, by request of the Hindu, I had constantly fed
with live coals. Little by little it assumed a form entire human, and I
distinguished the spectre—for I cannot call it otherwise—of an old Brahman
sacrificator, kneeling near the little brasier.</p>

<p>“He bore on his forehead the signs sacred to Vishnu, and around his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
body the triple cord, sign of the initiates of the priestly caste. He joined
his hands above his head, as during the sacrifices, and his lips moved as
if they were reciting prayers. At a given moment, he took a pinch of
perfumed powder, and threw it upon the coals; it must have been a
strong compound, for a thick smoke arose on the instant, and filled the
two chambers.</p>

<p>“When it was dissipated, I perceived the spectre, which, two steps
from me, was extending to me its fleshless hand; I took it in mine, making
a salutation, and I was astonished to find it, although bony and hard,
warm and living.</p>

<p>“‘Art thou, indeed,’ said I at this moment, in a loud voice, ‘an ancient
inhabitant of the earth?’</p>

<p>“I had not finished the question, when the word <span class="allsmcap">AM</span> (yes) appeared
and then disappeared in letters of fire, on the breast of the old Brahman,
with an effect much like that which the word would produce if written in
the dark with a stick of phosphorus.</p>

<p>“‘Will you leave me nothing in token of your visit?’ I continued.</p>

<p>“The spirit broke the triple cord, composed of three strands of cotton,
which begirt his loins, gave it to me, and vanished at my
 <span class="lock">feet.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_160" id="FNanchor_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh Brahma! what is this mystery which takes place every night?...
When lying on the matting, with eyes closed, the body is lost sight
of, and the soul escapes to enter into conversation with the Pitris....
Watch over it, O Brahma, when, forsaking the resting body, it goes away
to hover over the waters, to wander in the immensity of heaven, and
penetrate into the dark and mysterious nooks of the valleys and grand
forests of the Hymavat!” (<cite>Agroushada Parikshai.</cite>)</p>

<p>The fakirs, when belonging to some particular temple, never act but
under orders. Not one of them, unless he has reached a degree of extraordinary
sanctity, is freed from the influence and guidance of his guru, his
teacher, who first initiated and instructed him in the mysteries of the
<em>occult</em> sciences. Like the <em>subject</em> of the European mesmerizer, the average
fakir can never rid himself entirely of the psychological influence
exercised on him by his guru. Having passed two or three hours in the
silence and solitude of the inner temple in prayer and meditation, the
fakir, when he emerges thence, is mesmerically strengthened and prepared;
he produces wonders far more varied and powerful than before
he entered. The “master” has <em>laid his hands upon him</em>, and the fakir
feels strong.</p>

<p>It may be shown, on the authority of many Brahmanical and Buddhist
sacred books, that there has ever existed a great difference between

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
adepts of the higher order, and purely psychological subjects—like many
of these fakirs, who are mediums in a certain qualified sense. True,
the fakir is ever talking of Pitris, and this is natural; for they are his
protecting deities. But are the Pitris <em>disembodied human beings of our
race</em>? This is the question, and we will discuss it in a moment.</p>

<p>We say that the fakir may be regarded in a degree as a medium;
for he is—what is not generally known—under the direct mesmeric influence
of a living adept, his sannyâsi or guru. When the latter dies,
the power of the former, unless he has received the last transfer of
spiritual forces, wanes and often even disappears. Why, if it were otherwise,
should the fakirs have been excluded from the right of advancing
to the second and third degree? The lives of many of them exemplify
a degree of self-sacrifice and sanctity unknown and utterly incomprehensible
to Europeans, who shudder at the bare thought of such self-inflicted
tortures. But however shielded from control by vulgar and earth-bound
spirits, however wide the chasm between a debasing influence and their
self-controlled souls; and however well protected by the seven-knotted magical
bamboo rod which he receives from the guru, still the fakir lives in the
outer world of sin and matter, and it is possible that his soul may be
tainted, perchance, by the magnetic emanations from profane objects
and persons, and thereby open an access to strange spirits and <i>gods</i>.
To admit one so situated, one not under any and all circumstances
sure of the mastery over himself, to a knowledge of the awful mysteries
and priceless secrets of initiation, would be impracticable. It would not
only imperil the security of that which must, at all hazards, be guarded
from profanation, but it would be consenting to admit behind the veil a
fellow being, whose mediumistic irresponsibility might at any moment
cause him to lose his life through an involuntary indiscretion. The same
law which prevailed in the Eleusinian Mysteries before our era, holds
good now in India.</p>

<p>Not only must the adept have mastery over himself, but he must be
able to control the inferior grades of spiritual beings, nature-spirits, and
earthbound souls, in short the very ones by whom, if by any, the fakir is
liable to be affected.</p>

<p>For the objector to affirm that the Brahman-adepts and the fakirs admit
that of themselves they are powerless, and can only act with the help of
disembodied human spirits, is to state that these Hindus are unacquainted
with the laws of their sacred books and even the meaning of the word <i>Pitris</i>.
The <cite>Laws of Manu</cite>, the <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>, and other books, prove what we
now say. “All that exists,” says the <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>, “is in the power
of the gods. The gods are under the power of magical conjurations.
The magical conjurations are under the control of the Brahmans. Hence

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
the gods are in the power of the Brahmans.” This is logical, albeit seemingly
paradoxical, and it is the fact. And this fact will explain to those
who have not hitherto had the clew (among whom Jacolliot must be numbered,
as will appear on reading his works), why the fakir should be confined
to the first, or lowest degree of that course of initiation whose highest
adepts, or hierophants, are the <i>sannyâsis</i>, or members of the ancient
Supreme Council of Seventy.</p>

<p>Moreover, in Book <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, of the Hindu <cite>Genesis</cite>, or <cite>Book of Creation</cite>
of <cite>Manu</cite>, the <i>Pitris</i> are called the <em>lunar</em> ancestors of the human race.
They belong to a race of beings different from ourselves, and cannot
properly be called “human spirits” in the sense in which the spiritualists
use this term. This is what is said of them:</p>

<p>“Then they (the gods) created the Jackshas, the Rakshasas, the
Pisatshas,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_161" id="FNanchor_161">[161]</a>
 the Gandarbas<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_162" id="FNanchor_162">[162]</a>
 and the Apsaras, and the Asuras, the Nagas,
the Sarpas and the Suparnas,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_163" id="FNanchor_163">[163]</a>
 and the Pitris—<em>lunar ancestors of the
human race</em>” (See <cite>Institutes of Manu</cite>, Book <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, sloka 37, where the Pitris
are termed “progenitors of mankind”).</p>

<p>The Pitris are a distinct race of spirits belonging to the mythological
hierarchy or rather to the kabalistical nomenclature, and must
be included with the good genii, the dæmons of the Greeks, or the
inferior gods of the invisible world; and when a fakir attributes his phenomena
to the Pitris, he means only what the ancient philosophers and
theurgists meant when they maintained that all the “miracles” were
obtained through the intervention of the gods, or the good and bad
dæmons, who control the powers of nature, the <i>elementals</i>, who are subordinate
to the power of him “who knows.” A ghost or human phantom
would be termed by a fakir <i>palīt</i>, or <i>chutnā</i>, as that of a female human
spirit <i>pichhalpāi</i>, not <i>pitris</i>. True, <i>pitara</i> means (plural) fathers, ancestors;
and pitrā-i is a kinsman; but these words are used in quite a
different sense from that of the Pitris invoked in the mantras.</p>

<p>To maintain before a devout Brahman or a fakir that any one can
converse with the spirits of the dead, would be to shock him with what
would appear to him blasphemy. Does not the concluding verse of the
<cite>Bagavat</cite> state that this supreme felicity is alone reserved to the holy
sannyâsis, the gurus, and yogis?</p>

<p>“Long before they finally rid themselves of their mortal envelopes,
the souls who have practiced only good, such as those of the sannyâsis
and the vanaprasthas, acquire the faculty of conversing with the souls
which preceded them to the swarga.”</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
In this case the Pitris instead of genii are the spirits, or rather souls,
of the departed ones. But they will freely communicate only with those
whose atmosphere is as pure as their own, and to whose prayerful <i>kalassa</i>
(invocation) they can respond without the risk of defiling their own celestial
purity. When the soul of the invocator has reached the <i>Sayadyam</i>,
or perfect identity of essence with the Universal Soul, when matter is
utterly conquered, then the adept can freely enter into daily and hourly
communion with those who, though unburdened with their corporeal forms,
are still themselves progressing through the endless series of transformations
included in the gradual approach to the Paramâtma, or the grand
Universal Soul.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind that the Christian fathers have always claimed for
themselves and their saints the name of “friends of God,” and knowing
that they borrowed this expression, with many others, from the technology
of the Pagan temples, it is but natural to expect them to show an evil
temper whenever alluding to these rites. Ignorant, as a rule, and having
had biographers as ignorant as themselves, we could not well expect
them to find in the accounts of their beatific visions a descriptive beauty
such as we find in the Pagan classics. Whether the visions and objective
phenomena claimed by both the fathers of the desert and the hierophants
of the sanctuary are to be discredited, or accepted as facts, the splendid
imagery employed by Proclus and Apuleius in narrating the small portion
of the final initiation that they dared reveal, throws completely into
the shade the plagiaristic tales of the Christian ascetics, faithful <em>copies</em>
though they were intended to be. The story of the temptation of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Anthony in the desert by the female demon, is a parody upon the preliminary
trials of the neophyte during the <i>Mikra</i>, or minor Mysteries of
Agræ—those rites at the thought of which Clemens railed so bitterly, and
which represented the bereaved Demeter in search of her child, and her
good-natured hostess
 <span class="lock">Baubo.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_164" id="FNanchor_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Without entering again into a demonstration that in Christian, and
especially Irish Roman Catholic,
 <span class="lock">churches<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_165" id="FNanchor_165">[165]</a></span>
 the same apparently indecent
customs as the above prevailed until the end of the last century,
we will recur to the untiring labors of that honest and brave defender of
the ancient faith, Thomas Taylor, and his works. However much dogmatic
Greek scholarship may have found to say against his “mistranslations,”
his memory must be dear to every true Platonist, who seeks rather
to learn the inner thought of the great philosopher than enjoy the mere
external mechanism of his writings. Better classical translators may have

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
rendered us, in more correct phraseology, Plato’s <em>words</em>, but Taylor shows
us Plato’s <em>meaning</em>, and this is more than can be said of Zeller, Jowett, and
their predecessors. Yet, as writes Professor A. Wilder, “Taylor’s works
have met with favor at the hands of men capable of profound and recondite
thinking; and it must be conceded that he was endowed with a
superior qualification—that of an intuitive perception of the interior
meaning of the subjects which he considered. Others may have known
more Greek, but he knew more
 <span class="lock">Plato.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_166" id="FNanchor_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Taylor devoted his whole useful life to the search after such old
manuscripts as would enable him to have his own speculations concerning
several obscure rites in the Mysteries corroborated by writers who had
been initiated themselves. It is with full confidence in the assertions of
various classical writers that we say that ridiculous, perhaps licentious in
some cases, as may appear ancient worship to the modern critic, it ought
not to have so appeared to the Christians. During the mediæval ages, and
even later, they accepted pretty nearly the same without understanding
the secret import of its rites, and quite satisfied with the obscure and
rather fantastic interpretations of their clergy, who accepted the exterior
form and distorted the inner meaning. We are ready to concede, in full
justice, that centuries have passed since the great majority of the Christian
clergy, who <em>are not allowed to pry into God’s mysteries nor seek to
explain</em> that which the Church has once accepted and established, have
had the remotest idea of their symbolism, whether in its exoteric or esoteric
meaning. Not so with the head of the Church and its highest dignitaries.
And if we fully agree with Inman that it is “difficult to believe
that the ecclesiastics who sanctioned the publication of such
 <span class="lock">prints<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_167" id="FNanchor_167">[167]</a></span>
 could
have been as ignorant as modern ritualists,” we are not at all prepared
to believe with the same author “that the latter, if they knew the real
meaning of the symbols commonly used by the Roman Church, would
<em>not</em> have adopted them.”</p>

<p>To eliminate what is plainly derived from the sex and nature worship

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
of the ancient heathens, would be equivalent to pulling down the
whole Roman Catholic image-worship—the <em>Madonna</em> element—and
reforming the faith to Protestantism. The enforcement of the late dogma
of the Immaculation was prompted by this very secret reason. The
science of symbology was making too rapid progress. Blind faith in the
Pope’s infallibility and in the immaculate nature of the Virgin and <em>of her
ancestral female lineage to a certain remove</em> could alone save the Church
from the indiscreet revelations of science. It was a clever stroke of
policy on the part of the vicegerent of God. What matters it if, by
“conferring upon her such an honor,” as Don Pascale de Franciscis
naïvely expresses it, he has made a goddess of the Virgin Mary, an Olympian
Deity, who, having been by her very nature placed in the impossibility
of sinning, can claim no virtue, no personal merit for her purity,
precisely for which, as we were taught to believe in our younger days, she
was chosen among all other women. If his Holiness has deprived her of
this, perhaps, on the other hand, he thinks that he has endowed her with
at least one physical attribute not shared by the other virgin-goddesses.
But even this new dogma, which, in company with the new claim to
<em>infallibility</em>, has quasi-revolutionized the Christian world, is not original
with the Church of Rome. It is but a return to a hardly-remembered
<em>heresy</em> of the early Christian ages, that of the Collyridians, so called from
their <em>sacrificing cakes</em> to the Virgin, whom they claimed to <em>be
 Virgin-born</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_168" id="FNanchor_168">[168]</a>
The new sentence, “O, Virgin Mary, <em>conceived without sin</em>,” is
simply a tardy acceptance of that which was at first deemed a “<em>blasphemous
heresie</em>” by the orthodox fathers.</p>

<p>To think for one moment that any of the popes, cardinals, or other
high dignitaries “were not aware” from the first to the last of the external
meanings of their symbols, is to do injustice to their great learning
and their spirit of Machiavellism. It is to forget that the emissaries of
Rome will never be stopped by any difficulty which can be skirted by the
employment of Jesuitical artifice. The policy of complaisant conformity
was never carried to greater lengths than by the missionaries in Ceylon,
who, according to the Abbé Dubois—certainly a learned and competent
authority—“conducted the images of the Virgin and Saviour on triumphal
cars, imitated from the orgies of Juggernauth, and introduced the dancers
from the Brahminical rites into the ceremonial of the
 <span class="lock">church.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_169" id="FNanchor_169">[169]</a></span>
 Let us
at least thank these black-frocked politicians for their consistency in
employing the car of Juggernauth, upon which the “wicked heathen”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
convey the <i>lingham</i> of Siva. To have used <em>this</em> car to carry in its turn
the Romish representative of the female principle in nature, is to show
discrimination and a thorough knowledge of the oldest mythological conceptions.
They have blended the two deities, and thus represented, in a
Christian procession, the “heathen” Brahma, or Nara (the father), Nari
(the mother), and Viradj (the son).</p>

<p>Says Manu: “The Sovereign Master who exists through himself, divides
his body into two halves, male and female, and from the union of
these two principles is born Viradj, the Son.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_170" id="FNanchor_170">[170]</a><span class="lock"></span></p>

<p>There was not a Christian Father who could have been ignorant of
these symbols in their physical meaning; for it is in this latter aspect
that they were abandoned to the ignorant rabble. Moreover, they all
had as good reasons to suspect the occult symbolism contained in these
images; although as none of them—Paul excepted, perhaps—had been
initiated they could know nothing whatever about the nature of the final
rites. Any person revealing these mysteries was put to death, regardless
of sex, nationality, or creed. A Christian father would no more be
proof against <em>an accident</em> than a Pagan <i>Mysta</i> or the Μύστης.</p>

<p>If during the <i>Aporreta</i> or preliminary arcanes, there were some
practices which might have shocked the pudicity of a Christian convert—though
we doubt the sincerity of such statements—their mystical
symbolism was all sufficient to relieve the performance of any charge of
licentiousness. Even the episode of the Matron Baubo—whose rather
eccentric method of consolation was immortalized in the minor Mysteries—is
explained by impartial mystagogues quite naturally. Ceres-Demeter
and her earthly wanderings in search of her daughter are the
euhemerized descriptions of one of the most metaphysico-psychological
subjects ever treated of by human mind. It is a mask for the transcendent
narrative of the initiated seers; the celestial vision of the freed soul
of the initiate of the last hour describing the process by which the soul
that has not yet been incarnated descends for the first time into matter,
“Blessed is he who hath seen those <em>common concerns</em> of the underworld;
he knows both the end of life and its divine origin from Jupiter,”
says Pindar. Taylor shows, on the authority of more than one initiate,
that the “dramatic performances of the Lesser Mysteries were designed
by their founders, to signify <em>occultly</em> the condition of the unpurified soul
invested with an earthly body, and enveloped in a material and physical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
nature ... that the soul, indeed, till purified by philosophy, suffers
death through its union with the body.”</p>

<p>The body is the sepulchre, the prison of the soul, and many Christian
Fathers held with Plato that the soul is <em>punished</em> through its union with
the body. Such is the fundamental doctrine of the Buddhists and of
many Brahmanists too. When Plotinus remarks that “when the soul
has descended into generation (from its <em>half</em>-divine condition) she partakes
of evil, and is carried a great way into a state the opposite of her
first purity and integrity, to be entirely merged in which is nothing more
than to fall into dark
 <span class="lock">mire;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_171" id="FNanchor_171">[171]</a></span>
 he only repeats the teachings of Gautama-Buddha.
If we have to believe the ancient initiates at all, we must
accept their interpretation of the symbols. And if, moreover, we find
them perfectly coinciding with the teachings of the greatest philosophers
and that which we know symbolizes the same meaning in the modern
Mysteries in the East, we must believe them to be right.</p>

<p>If Demeter was considered the intellectual soul, or rather the <em>Astral</em>
soul, half emanation from the spirit and half tainted with matter through
a succession of spiritual evolutions—we may readily understand what is
meant by the Matron Baubo, the Enchantress, who before she succeeds
in reconciling the soul—Demeter, to its new position, finds herself obliged
to assume the sexual forms of an infant. Baubo is <em>matter</em>, the physical
body; and the intellectual, as yet pure astral soul can be ensnared into
its new terrestrial prison but by the display of innocent babyhood.
Until then, doomed to her fate, Demeter, or <i>Magna-mater</i>, the Soul, wonders
and hesitates and suffers; but once having partaken of the magic
potion prepared by Baubo, she forgets her sorrows; for a certain time
she parts with that consciousness of higher intellect that she was possessed
of before entering the body of a child. Thenceforth she must
seek to rejoin it again; and when the age of reason arrives for the child,
the struggle—forgotten for a few years of infancy—begins again. The
astral soul is placed between matter (body) and the highest intellect
(its immortal spirit or <i>nous</i>). Which of those two will conquer? The
result of the battle of life lies between the triad. It is a question of a
few years of physical enjoyment on earth and—if it has begotten abuse—of
the dissolution of the earthly body being followed by death of the
astral body, which thus is prevented from being united with the highest
spirit of the triad, which alone confers on us individual immortality; or,
on the other hand, of becoming immortal mystæ; initiated before death
of the body into the divine truths of the after life. Demi-gods below,
and <span class="allsmcap">GODS</span> above.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the chief object of the Mysteries represented as diabolical
by theology, and ridiculed by modern symbologists. To disbelieve that
there exist in man certain arcane powers, which, by psychological study
he can develop in himself to the highest degree, become an hierophant
and then impart to others under the same conditions of earthly discipline,
is to cast an imputation of falsehood and lunacy upon a number of the
best, purest, and most learned men of antiquity and of the middle ages.
What the hierophant was allowed to see at the last hour is hardly hinted
at by them. And yet Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus, Iamblichus, Proclus,
and many others knew and affirmed their reality.</p>

<p>Whether in the “inner temple,” or through the study of theurgy carried
on privately, or by the sole exertion of a whole life of spiritual labor, they
all obtained the practical proof of such divine possibilities for man fighting
his battle with life on earth to win a life in the eternity. What the
last <i>epopteia</i> was is alluded to by Plato in <cite>Phædrus</cite> (64); “... being
initiated in those <em>Mysteries</em>, which it is lawful to call the most blessed of
all mysteries ... we were freed from the molestations of evils which
otherwise await us in a future period of time. Likewise, in consequence
of this divine <em>initiation</em>, we became <em>spectators</em> of entire, simple, immovable,
and <em>blessed visions</em>, resident in a pure light.” This sentence shows
that they saw <em>visions</em>, gods, spirits. As Taylor correctly observes, from
all such passages in the works of the initiates it may be inferred, “that
the most sublime part of the <i>epopteia</i> ... consisted in beholding the
gods themselves invested with a resplendent light,” or highest planetary
spirits. The statement of Proclus upon this subject is unequivocal: “In
all the initiations and mysteries, the gods exhibit many forms of themselves,
and appear in <em>a variety of shapes</em>, and sometimes, indeed, a formless
light of themselves is held forth to the view; sometimes this light is
according <em>to a human form</em>, and sometimes it proceeds into a different
<span class="lock">shape.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_172" id="FNanchor_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whatever is <em>on earth is the resemblance and</em> <span class="allsmcap">SHADOW</span>
 <em>of something
that is in the sphere</em>, while that resplendent thing (the prototype of the
soul-spirit) remaineth in <em>unchangeable</em> condition, it is well also with its
shadow. But when the <em>resplendent one</em> removeth far from its shadow life
removeth from the latter to a distance. And yet, that very light is the
shadow of something still more resplendent than itself.” Thus speaks
<cite>Desatir</cite>, the Persian <cite>Book of</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Shet</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_173" id="FNanchor_173">[173]</a></span>
 thereby showing its identity of esoteric
doctrines with those of the Greek philosophers.</p>

<p>The second statement of Plato confirms our belief that the Mysteries
of the ancients were identical with the Initiations, as practiced now

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
among the Buddhists and the Hindu adepts. The highest visions, the
most <em>truthful</em>, are produced, not through <em>natural</em> ecstatics or “mediums,”
as it is sometimes erroneously asserted, but through a regular discipline
of gradual initiations and development of psychical powers. The Mystæ
were brought into close union with those whom Proclus calls “mystical
natures,” “resplendent gods,” because, as Plato says, “we were ourselves
pure and immaculate, being liberated from this <em>surrounding vestment</em>,
which we denominate body, and to which we are now bound like
an oyster to its <span class="lock">shell.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_174" id="FNanchor_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>So the doctrine of planetary and terrestrial Pitris was revealed <em>entirely</em>
in ancient India, as well as now, only at the last moment of
initiation, and to the adepts of superior degrees. Many are the fakirs,
who, though pure, and honest, and self-devoted, have yet never seen the
astral form of a purely <i>human pitar</i> (an ancestor or father), otherwise
than at the solemn moment of their first and last initiation. It is in the
presence of his instructor, the guru, and just before the <em>vatou</em>-fakir is
dispatched into the world of the living, with his seven-knotted bamboo
wand for all protection, that he is suddenly placed face to face with the
unknown <span class="allsmcap">PRESENCE</span>. He sees it, and falls prostrate at the feet of the
evanescent form, but is not entrusted with the great secret of its evocation;
for it is the supreme mystery of the holy syllable. The <span class="smcap">Aum</span> contains
the evocation of the Vedic triad, the <i>Trimurti</i> Brahma, Vishnu, Siva,
say the Orientalists;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_175" id="FNanchor_175">[175]</a>
 it contains the evocation of <em>something more real
and objective than this triune abstraction</em>—we say, respectfully contradicting
the eminent scientists. It is the trinity of man himself, on his way
to become immortal through the solemn union of his inner triune
 <span class="allsmcap">SELF</span>—the
exterior, gross body, the husk not even being taken in consideration
in this human trinity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_176" id="FNanchor_176">[176]</a>
 It is, when this trinity, in anticipation of the final

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
triumphant reunion beyond the gates of corporeal death became for a
few seconds a <span class="allsmcap">UNITY</span>, that the candidate
 is allowed, at the moment of the
initiation, to behold his future self. Thus we read in the Persian <cite>Desatir</cite>,
of the “Resplendent one;” in the Greek philosopher-initiates, of
the Augoeides—the self-shining “blessed vision resident in the pure light;”
in Porphyry, that Plotinus was united to his “god” six times during his
lifetime; and so on.</p>

<p>“In ancient India, the mystery of the triad, known but to the initiates,
could not, under the penalty of death, be revealed to the vulgar,”
says Vrihaspati.</p>

<p>Neither could it in the ancient Grecian and Samothracian Mysteries.
<em>Nor can it be now.</em> It is in the hands of the adepts, and must remain
a mystery to the world so long as the materialistic savant regards it as an
undemonstrated fallacy, an insane hallucination, and the dogmatic theologian,
a snare of the Evil One.</p>

<p><em>Subjective</em> communication with the human, god-like spirits of those who
have preceded us to the silent land of bliss, is in India divided into three
categories. Under the spiritual training of a guru or sannyâsi, the vatou
(disciple or neophyte) begins <em>to feel</em> them. Were he not under the immediate
guidance of an adept, he would be controlled by the invisibles, and
utterly at their mercy, for among these subjective influences he is unable
to discern the good from the bad. Happy the sensitive who is sure of
the purity of his spiritual atmosphere!</p>

<p>To this subjective consciousness, which is the <em>first</em> degree, is, after
a time, added that of clairaudience. This is the <em>second</em> degree or stage of
development. The sensitive—when not naturally made so by psychological
training—now audibly hears, but is still unable to discern; and
is incapable of verifying his impressions, and one who is unprotected
the tricky powers of the air but too often delude with semblances of
voices and speech. But the guru’s influence is there; it is the most
powerful shield against the intrusion of the <em>bhutná</em> into the atmosphere
of the vatou, consecrated to the pure, human, and celestial Pitris.</p>

<p>The <em>third</em> degree is that when the fakir or any other candidate both
feels, hears, and sees; and when he can at will produce the <em>reflections</em>
of the Pitris on the mirror of astral light. All depends upon his psychological
and mesmeric powers, which are always proportionate to the intensity
of his <em>will</em>. But the fakir will never control the Akasa, the spiritual
life-principle, the omnipotent agent of every phenomenon, in the
same degree as an adept of the third and highest initiation. And the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
phenomena produced by the will of the latter do not generally run the
market-places for the satisfaction of open-mouthed investigators.</p>

<p>The unity of God, the immortality of the spirit, belief in salvation
only through our works, merit and demerit; such are the principal articles
of faith of the Wisdom-religion, and the ground work of Vedaism,
Buddhism, Parsism, and such we find to have been even that of the ancient
Osirism, when we, after abandoning the popular sun-god to the
materialism of the rabble, confine our attention to the <cite>Books of Hermes</cite>,
the thrice-great.</p>

<p>“The <span class="allsmcap">THOUGHT</span> concealed as yet the world in silence and darkness....
Then the Lord who exists through Himself, and <em>who is not to be
divulged to the external senses of man</em>; dissipated darkness, and manifested
the perceptible world.”</p>

<p>“He that can be perceived only by the spirit, that escapes the
organs of sense, who is without visible parts, eternal, the soul of all
beings, that none can comprehend, displayed His own splendor”
(<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, slokas, 6-7).</p>

<p>Such is the ideal of the Supreme in the mind of every Hindu philosopher.</p>

<p>“Of all the duties, the principal one is to acquire the knowledge of
the supreme soul (the spirit); it is the first of all sciences, <em>for it alone
confers on man immortality</em>” (<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr>, sloka 85).</p>

<p>And our scientists talk of the Nirvana of Buddha and the Moksha of
Brahma as of a complete annihilation! It is thus that the following
verse is interpreted by some materialists.</p>

<p>“The man who recognizes the <em>Supreme Soul</em>, in his own soul, as
well as in that of all creatures, and who is equally just to all (whether
man or animals) obtains the happiest of all fates, that to be finally <em>absorbed</em>
in the bosom of Brahma” (<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr>, sloka 125).</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Moksha and the Nirvana, as understood by the
school of Max Müller, can never bear confronting with numerous texts
that can be found, if required, as a final refutation. There are sculptures
in many pagodas which contradict, point-blank, the imputation.
Ask a Brahman to explain Moksha, address yourself to an educated Buddhist
and pray him to define for you the meaning of Nirvana. Both
will answer you that in every one of these religions Nirvana represents
the dogma of the spirit’s immortality. That, to reach the Nirvana
means absorption into the great universal soul, the latter representing a
<em>state</em>, not an individual being or an anthropomorphic god, as some understand
the great <span class="allsmcap">EXISTENCE</span>. That a spirit reaching such a state becomes
a <em>part</em> of the integral <em>whole</em>, but never loses its individuality for all that.
Henceforth, the spirit lives spiritually, without any fear of further modifications

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
of form; for form pertains to matter, and the state of <em>Nirvana</em>
implies a complete purification or a final riddance from even the most
sublimated particle of matter.</p>

<p>This word, <em>absorbed</em>, when it is proved that the Hindus and Buddhists
believe in the <em>immortality</em> of the spirit, must necessarily mean intimate
union, not annihilation. Let Christians call them idolaters, if they still dare
do so, in the face of science and the latest translations of the sacred
Sanscrit books; they have no right to present the speculative philosophy
of ancient sages as an inconsistency and the philosophers themselves as
illogical fools. With far better reason we can accuse the ancient Jews
of utter <em>nihilism</em>. There is not a word contained in the Books of Moses—or
the prophets either—which, taken literally, implies the spirit’s immortality.
Yet every devout Jew hopes as well to be “gathered into the
bosom of A-Braham.”</p>

<p>The hierophants and some Brahmans are accused of having administered
to their epoptai strong drinks or anæsthetics to produce visions which
shall be taken by the latter as realities. They did and do use sacred beverages
which, like the Soma-drink, possess the faculty of freeing the astral
form from the bonds of matter; but in those visions there is as little to
be attributed to hallucination as in the glimpses which the scientist, by
the help of his optical instrument, gets into the microscopic world. A man
cannot perceive, touch, and converse with pure spirit through any of his
bodily senses. Only spirit alone can talk to and see spirit; and even
our astral soul, the <em lang="de">Doppelganger</em>, is too gross, too much tainted yet with
earthly matter to trust entirely to its perceptions and insinuations.</p>

<p>How dangerous may often become <em>untrained</em> mediumship, and how
thoroughly it was understood and provided against by the ancient sages,
is perfectly exemplified in the case of Socrates. The old Grecian philosopher
was a “medium;” hence, he had never been initiated into the
Mysteries; for such was the rigorous law. But he had his “familiar
spirit” as they call it, his <i>daimonion</i>; and this invisible counsellor
became the cause of his death. It is generally believed that if he was
not initiated into the Mysteries it was because he himself neglected to
become so. But the <cite>Secret Records</cite> teach us that it was because he could
not be admitted to participate in the sacred rites, and precisely, as we
state, on account of his mediumship. There was a law against the
admission not only of such as were convicted of deliberate <em>witchcraft</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_177" id="FNanchor_177">[177]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
but even of those who were known to have “a familiar spirit.” The law
was just and logical, because a genuine medium is more or less irresponsible;
and the eccentricities of Socrates are thus accounted for in
some degree. A medium must be <em>passive</em>; and if a firm believer in his
“spirit-guide” he will allow himself to be ruled by the latter, not by the
rules of the sanctuary. A <em>medium</em> of olden times, like the modern
“medium” was subject to be <em>entranced</em> at the will and pleasure of the
“power” which <em>controlled</em> him; therefore, he could not well have been
entrusted with the awful secrets of the final initiation, “never to be revealed
under the penalty of death.” The old sage, in unguarded moments of
“spiritual inspiration,” revealed that which he had never learned; and
was therefore put to death as an atheist.</p>

<p>How then, with such an instance as that of Socrates, in relation to
the visions and spiritual wonders at the epoptai, of the Inner Temple,
can any one assert that these seers, theurgists, and thaumaturgists were
all “spirit-mediums?” Neither Pythagoras, Plato, nor any of the later
more important Neo-platonists; neither Iamblichus, Longinus, Proclus,
nor Apollonius of Tyana, were ever mediums; for in such case they
would not have been admitted to the Mysteries at all. As Taylor proves—“This
assertion of divine visions in the Mysteries is clearly confirmed
by Plotinus. And in short, that magical evocation formed a part of the
sacerdotal office in them, and that this was universally believed by all
antiquity long before the era of the later Platonists,” shows that apart
from natural “mediumship,” there has existed, from the beginning of
time, a mysterious science, discussed by many, but known only to a few.</p>

<p>The use of it is a longing toward our only true and real home—the
after-life, and a desire to cling more closely to our parent spirit; abuse
of it is sorcery, witchcraft, <em>black</em> magic. Between the two is placed natural
“mediumship;” a soul clothed with imperfect matter, a ready agent
for either the one or the other, and utterly dependent on its surroundings
of life, constitutional heredity—physical as well as mental—and on the
nature of the “spirits” it attracts around itself. A blessing or a curse,
as fate will have it, unless the medium is purified of earthly dross.</p>

<p>The reason why in every age so little has been generally known of the
mysteries of initiation, is twofold. The first has already been explained
by more than one author, and lies in the terrible penalty following the least
indiscretion. The second, is the superhuman difficulties and even dangers
which the daring candidate of old had to encounter, and either conquer,
or die in the attempt, when, what is still worse, he did not lose his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
reason. There was no real danger to him whose mind had become thoroughly
spiritualized, and so prepared for every terrific sight. He who
fully recognized the power of his immortal spirit, and never doubted for
one moment its omnipotent protection, had naught to fear. But woe to
the candidate in whom the slightest physical fear—sickly child of matter—made
him lose sight and faith in his own invulnerability. He who
was not wholly confident of his moral fitness to accept the burden of these
tremendous secrets was doomed.</p>

<p>The <cite>Talmud</cite> gives the story of the four Tanaïm, who are made, in
allegorical terms, to enter into <em>the garden of delights</em>; <i>i.e.</i>, to be initiated
into the occult and final science.</p>

<p>“According to the teaching of our holy masters the names of the four
who entered the garden of delight, are: Ben Asai, Ben Zoma, Acher, and
Rabbi Akiba....</p>

<p>“Ben Asai looked and—lost his sight.</p>

<p>“Ben Zoma looked and—lost his reason.</p>

<p>“Acher made depredations in the plantation” (mixed up the whole
and failed). “But Akiba, who had entered in peace, came out of it in
peace, for the saint whose name be blessed had said, ‘This old man is
worthy of serving us with glory.’”</p>

<p>“The learned commentators of the <cite>Talmud</cite>, the Rabbis of the synagogue,
explain that the <em>garden of delight</em>, in which those four personages
are made to enter, is but that mysterious science, the most terrible of
sciences <em>for weak intellects, which it leads directly to insanity</em>,” says A.
Franck, in his <cite>Kabbala</cite>. It is not the pure at heart and he who studies
but with a view to perfecting himself and so more easily acquiring the
promised immortality, who need have any fear; but rather he who
makes of the science of sciences a sinful pretext for worldly motives, who
should tremble. <em>The latter will never withstand the kabalistic evocations
of the supreme initiation.</em></p>

<p>The licentious performances of the thousand and one early Christian
sects, may be criticised by partial commentators as well as the ancient
Eleusinian and other rites. But why should they incur the blame of the
theologians, the Christians, when their own “Mysteries” of “the divine
incarnation with Joseph, Mary, and the angel” in a sacred <em>trilogue</em> used
to be enacted in more than one country, and were famous at one time in
Spain and Southern France? Later, they fell like many other once
secret rites into the hands of the populace. It is but a few years since,
during every Christmas week, Punch-and-Judy-boxes, containing the above
named personages, an additional display of the infant Jesus in his manger,
were carried about the country in Poland and Southern Russia. They
were called <i>Kaliadovki</i>, a word the correct etymology of which we are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
unable to give unless it is from the verb <i>Kaliadovât</i>, a word that we as
willingly abandon to learned philologists. We have seen this show in
our days of childhood. We remember the three king-Magi represented
by three dolls in powdered wigs and colored tights; and it is from recollecting
the simple, profound veneration depicted on the faces of the
pious audience, that we can the more readily appreciate the honest and
just remark by the editor, in the introduction to the <cite>Eleusinian Mysteries</cite>,
who says: “It is ignorance which leads to profanation. Men ridicule
what they do not properly understand.... The undercurrent of this
world is set toward one goal; and inside of human credulity—call it
human weakness, if you please—is a power almost infinite, a holy faith
capable of apprehending the supremest truths of all existence.”</p>

<p>If that abstract sentiment called <em>Christian charity</em> prevailed in the
Church, we would be well content to leave all this unsaid. We have no
quarrel with Christians whose faith is sincere and whose practice coincides
with their profession. But with an arrogant, dogmatic, and dishonest
clergy, we have nothing to do except to see the ancient philosophy—antagonized
by modern theology in its puny offspring—Spiritualism—defended
and righted so far as we are able, so that its grandeur and sufficiency
may be thoroughly displayed. It is not alone for the esoteric
philosophy that we fight; nor for any modern system of moral philosophy,
but for the inalienable right of private judgment, and especially for
the ennobling idea of a future life of activity and accountability.</p>

<p>We eagerly applaud such commentators as Godfrey Higgins, Inman,
Payne Knight, King, Dunlap, and Dr. Newton, however much they disagree
with our own mystical views, for their diligence is constantly being
rewarded by fresh discoveries of the Pagan paternity of Christian symbols.
But otherwise, all these learned works are useless. Their researches
only cover half the ground. Lacking the true key of interpretation
they see the symbols only in a physical aspect. They have no password
to cause the gates of mystery to swing open; and ancient spiritual
philosophy is to them a closed book. Diametrically opposed though
they be to the clergy in their ideas respecting it, in the way of interpretation
they do little more than their opponents for a questioning public.
Their labors tend to strengthen materialism as those of the clergy,
especially the Romish clergy, do to cultivate belief in diabolism.</p>

<p>If the study of Hermetic philosophy held out no other hope of reward,
it would be more than enough to know that by it we may learn with what
perfection of justice the world is governed. A sermon upon this text is
preached by every page of history. Among all there is not one that conveys
a deeper moral than the case of the Roman Church. The divine
law of compensation was never more strikingly exemplified than in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
fact that by her own act she has deprived herself of the only possible key
to her own religious mysteries. The assumption of Godfrey Higgins that
there are two doctrines maintained in the Roman Church, one for the
masses and the other—the esoteric—for the “perfect,” or the initiates, as
in the ancient Mysteries, appears to us unwarranted and rather fantastic.
They have lost the key, we repeat; otherwise no terrestrial power could
have prostrated her, and except a superficial knowledge of the means of
producing “miracles,” her clergy can in no way be compared in their
wisdom with the hierophants of old.</p>

<p>In burning the works of the theurgists; in proscribing those who affect
their study; in affixing the stigma of demonolatry to magic in general,
Rome has left her exoteric worship and <cite>Bible</cite> to be helplessly riddled by
every free-thinker, her sexual emblems to be identified with coarseness,
and her priests to unwittingly turn magicians and even sorcerers in their
exorcisms, which are but necromantic evocations. Thus retribution, by
the exquisite adjustment of divine law, is made to overtake this scheme of
cruelty, injustice, and bigotry, through her own suicidal acts.</p>

<p>True philosophy and divine truth are convertible terms. A religion
which dreads the light cannot be a religion based on either truth or philosophy—hence,
it must be false. The ancient Mysteries were mysteries
to the profane only, whom the hierophant never sought nor would accept as
proselytes; to the initiates the Mysteries became explained as soon as the
final veil was withdrawn. No mind like that of Pythagoras or Plato would
have contented itself with an unfathomable and incomprehensible mystery,
like that of the Christian dogma. There can be but one truth, for two
small truths on the same subject can but constitute one great error.
Among thousands of exoteric or popular conflicting religions which have
been propagated since the days when the first men were enabled to interchange
their ideas, not a nation, not a people, nor the most abject tribe,
but after their own fashion has believed in an Unseen God, the First
Cause of unerring and immutable laws, and in the immortality of our spirit.
No creed, no false philosophy, no religious exaggerations, could ever destroy
that feeling. It must, therefore, be based upon an absolute truth.
On the other hand, every one of the numberless religions and religious
sects views the Deity after its own fashion; and, fathering on the unknown
its own speculations, it enforces these purely human outgrowths
of overheated imagination on the ignorant masses, and calls them “revelation.”
As the dogmas of every religion and sect often differ radically,
they cannot be <i>true</i>. And if untrue, what are they?</p>

<p>“The greatest curse to a nation,” remarks Dr. Inman, “is not <em>a bad
religion</em>, but a form of faith which prevents manly inquiry. I know of
no nation of old that was priest-ridden which did not fall under the swords

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
of those who did not care for hierarchs.... The greatest danger is to
be feared from those ecclesiastics who wink at vice, and encourage it as
a means whereby they can gain power over their votaries. So long as
every man does to other men as he would that they should do to him,
and <em>allows no one to interfere between him and his Maker</em>, all will go well
with the <span class="lock">world.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_178" id="FNanchor_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Clement</span> describes Basilides, the Gnostic, as “a philosopher
devoted to the contemplation of divine things.” This very
appropriate expression may be applied to many of the founders of the
more important sects which later were all engulfed in one—that stupendous
compound of unintelligible dogmas enforced by Irenæus, Tertullian,
and others, which is now termed Christianity. <em>If these must be called
heresies, then early Christianity itself must be included in the number.</em>
Basilides and Valentinus preceded Irenæus and Tertullian; and the
two latter Fathers had less facts than the two former Gnostics to show
that their <em>heresy</em> was plausible. Neither divine right nor truth brought
about the triumph of their Christianity; fate alone was propitious. We
can assert, with entire plausibility, that there is not one of all these
sects—Kabalism, Judaism, and our present Christianity included—but
sprung from the two main branches of that one mother-trunk, the once
universal religion, which antedated the Vedaic ages—we speak of that
prehistoric Buddhism which merged later into Brahmanism.</p>

<p>The religion which the primitive teaching of the early few apostles
most resembled—a religion preached by Jesus himself—is the elder of
these two, Buddhism. The latter as taught in its primitive purity, and
carried to perfection by the last of the Buddhas, Gautama, based its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
moral ethics on three fundamental principles. It alleged that 1, every
thing existing, exists from natural causes; 2, that virtue brings its own
reward, and vice and sin their own punishment; and, 3, that the state
of man in this world is probationary. We might add that on these three
principles rested the universal foundation of every religious creed; God,
and individual immortality for every man—if he could but win it.
However puzzling the subsequent theological tenets; however seemingly
incomprehensible the metaphysical abstractions which have convulsed
the theology of every one of the great religions of mankind as
soon as it was placed on a sure footing, the above is found to be the
essence of every religious philosophy, with the exception of later Christianity.
It was that of Zoroaster, of Pythagoras, of Plato, of Jesus,
and even of Moses, albeit the teachings of the Jewish law-giver have
been so piously tampered with.</p>

<p>We will devote the present chapter mainly to a brief survey of the
numerous sects which have recognized themselves as Christians; that is
to say, that have believed in a <i>Christos</i>, or an <span class="allsmcap">ANOINTED ONE</span>. We will
also endeavor to explain the latter appellation from the kabalistic standpoint,
and show it reappearing in every religious system. It might be
profitable, at the same time, to see how much the earliest apostles—Paul
and Peter, agreed in their preaching of the new Dispensation. We will
begin with Peter.</p>

<p>We must once more return to that greatest of all the Patristic frauds;
the one which has undeniably helped the Roman Catholic Church to its
unmerited supremacy, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: the barefaced assertion, in the teeth of historical
evidence, that Peter suffered martyrdom at Rome. It is but too
natural that the Latin clergy should cling to it, for, with the exposure of
the fraudulent nature of this pretext, the dogma of apostolic succession
must fall to the ground.</p>

<p>There have been many able works of late, in refutation of this preposterous
claim. Among others we note Mr. G. Reber’s, <cite>The Christ of
Paul</cite>, which overthrows it quite ingeniously. The author proves, 1, that
there was no church established at Rome, until the reign of Antoninus
Pius; 2, that as Eusebius and Irenæus both agree that Linus was the
second Bishop of Rome, into whose hands “the blessed apostles” Peter
and Paul committed the church after building it, it could not have been at
any other time than between <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 64 and 68; 3, that this interval of
years happens during the reign of Nero, for Eusebius states that Linus
held this office twelve years (<cite>Ecclesiastical History</cite>, book <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>, c. 13),
entering upon it <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 69, one year after the death of Nero, and dying
himself in 81. After that the author maintains, on very solid grounds,
that Peter could not be in Rome <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 64, for he was then in Babylon;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
wherefrom he wrote his first Epistle, the date of which is fixed by Dr.
Lardner and other critics at precisely this year. But we believe that his
best argument is in proving that it was not in the character of the
cowardly Peter to risk himself in such close neighborhood with Nero,
who “was feeding the wild beasts of the Amphitheatre with the flesh and
bones of
 <span class="lock">Christians”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_179" id="FNanchor_179">[179]</a></span>
 at that time.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Church of Rome was but consistent in choosing as her
titular founder the apostle who thrice denied his master at the moment
of danger; and the only one, moreover, except Judas, who provoked
Christ in such a way as to be addressed as the “Enemy.” “Get thee
behind me, <span class="smcap">Satan</span>!” exclaims Jesus,
 rebuking the taunting
 <span class="lock">apostle.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_180" id="FNanchor_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a tradition in the Greek Church which has never found favor
at the Vatican. The former traces its origin to one of the Gnostic leaders—Basilides,
perhaps, who lived under Trajan and Adrian, at the end
of the first and the beginning of the second century. With regard to this
particular tradition, if the Gnostic is Basilides, then he must be accepted
as a sufficient authority, having claimed to have been a disciple of the
Apostle Matthew, and to have had for master Glaucias, a disciple of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Peter himself. Were the narrative attributed to him authenticated, the
London Committee for the Revision of the Bible would have to add a new
verse to <cite>Matthew</cite>, <cite>Mark</cite>, and <cite>John</cite>, who tell the story of Peter’s denial
of Christ.</p>

<p>This tradition, then, of which we have been speaking, affirms that,
when frightened at the accusation of the servant of the high priest, the
apostle had thrice denied his master, and the cock had crowed, Jesus,
who was then passing through the hall in custody of the soldiers, turned,
and, looking at Peter, said: “Verily, I say unto thee, Peter, thou shalt
deny me throughout the coming ages, and never stop until thou shalt be
old, and shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and
carry thee whither thou wouldst not.” The latter part of this sentence,
say the Greeks, relates to the Church of Rome, and prophesies her constant
apostasy from Christ, under the mask of false religion. Later, it
was inserted in the twenty-first chapter of <cite>John</cite>, but the whole of this
chapter had been pronounced a forgery, even before it was found that this
<em>Gospel</em> was never written by John the Apostle at all.</p>

<p>The anonymous author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite>, a work which in two
years passed through several editions, and which is alleged to have been
written by an eminent theologian, proves conclusively the spuriousness
of the four gospels, or at least their complete transformation in the hands

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
of the too-zealous Irenæus and his champions. The fourth gospel is
completely upset by this able author; the extraordinary forgeries of the
Fathers of the early centuries are plainly demonstrated, and the relative
value of the synoptics is discussed with an unprecedented power of logic.
The work carries conviction in its every line. From it we quote the following:
“We gain infinitely more than we lose in abandoning belief in
the reality of Divine Revelation. Whilst we retain, pure and unimpaired,
the treasure of Christian morality, we relinquish nothing but the debasing
elements added to it by human superstition. We are no longer bound
to believe a theology which outrages reason and moral sense. We are
freed from base anthropomorphic views of God and His government of
the Universe, and from Jewish Mythology we rise to higher conceptions
of an infinitely wise and beneficent Being, hidden from our finite minds, it
is true, in the impenetrable glory of Divinity, but whose laws of wondrous
comprehensiveness and perfection we ever perceive in operation around
us.... The argument so often employed by theologians, that Divine
revelation is necessary for man, and that certain views contained in that
revelation are required for our moral consciousness, is purely imaginary,
and derived from the revelation which it seeks to maintain. The only
thing absolutely necessary for man is <span class="smcap">Truth</span>, and to that, and that alone,
must our moral consciousness adapt <span class="lock">itself.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_181" id="FNanchor_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>We will consider farther in what light was regarded the Divine revelation
of the Jewish <cite>Bible</cite> by the Gnostics, who yet believed in Christ in
their own way, a far better and less blasphemous one than the Roman
Catholic. The Fathers have forced on the believers in Christ a <cite>Bible</cite>,
the laws prescribed in which he was the first to break; the teachings of
which he utterly rejected; and for which crimes he was finally crucified.
Of whatever else the Christian world can boast, it can hardly claim logic
and consistency as its chief virtues.</p>

<p>The fact alone that Peter remained to the last an “apostle of the circumcision,”
speaks for itself. <em>Whosoever else might have built the Church
of Rome it was not Peter.</em> If such were the case, the successors of this
apostle would have to submit themselves to circumcision, if it were but
for the sake of consistency, and to show that the claims of the popes are
not utterly groundless, Dr. Inman asserts that report says that “in our
Christian times popes have to be privately
 <span class="lock">perfect,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_182" id="FNanchor_182">[182]</a></span>
 but we do not know
whether it is carried to the extent of the Levitical Jewish law. The first
fifteen Christian bishops of Jerusalem, commencing with James and including
Judas, were all circumcised <span class="lock">Jews.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_183" id="FNanchor_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
In the <cite>Sepher Toldos</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Jeshu</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_184" id="FNanchor_184">[184]</a></span>
 a Hebrew manuscript of great antiquity,
the version about Peter is different. Simon Peter, it says, was one
of their own brethren, though he had somewhat departed from the laws,
and the Jewish hatred and persecution of the apostle seems to have
existed but in the fecund imagination of the fathers. The author speaks
of him with great respect and fairness, calling him “a faithful servant of
the living God,” who passed his life in austerity and meditation, “living
in Babylon at the summit of a tower,” composing hymns, and preaching
charity. He adds that Peter always recommended to the Christians not
to molest the Jews, but as soon as he was dead, behold another preacher
went to Rome and pretended that Simon Peter had altered the teachings
of his master. He invented a burning hell and threatened every one
with it; promised miracles, but worked none.</p>

<p>How much there is in the above of fiction and how much of truth, it
is for others to decide; but it certainly bears more the evidence of sincerity
and fact on its face, than the fables concocted by the fathers to
answer their end.</p>

<p>We may the more readily credit this friendship between Peter and his
late co-religionists as we find in <cite>Theodoret</cite> the following assertion: “The
Nazarenes are Jews, honoring the <span class="allsmcap">ANOINTED</span> (Jesus) as a <em>just man</em> and
using the <em>Evangel</em> according to
 <span class="lock">Peter.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_185" id="FNanchor_185">[185]</a></span>
 Peter was a Nazarene, according
to the <cite>Talmud</cite>. He belonged to the sect of the later Nazarenes,
which dissented from the followers of John the Baptist, and became a
rival sect; and which—as tradition goes—was instituted by Jesus himself.</p>

<p>History finds the first Christian sects to have been either Nazarenes like
John the Baptist; or Ebionites, among whom were many of the relatives
of Jesus; or Essenes (Iessaens) the Therapeutæ, healers, of which the
Nazaria were a branch. All these sects, which only in the days of Irenæus
began to be considered heretical, were more or less kabalistic.
They believed in the expulsion of demons by magical incantations, and
practiced this method; Jervis terms the Nabatheans and other such sects
“wandering Jewish
 <span class="lock">exorcists,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_186" id="FNanchor_186">[186]</a></span>
 the Arabic word <i>Nabæ</i>, meaning to wander,
and the Hebrew נבא naba, to prophesy. The <cite>Talmud</cite> indiscriminately

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
calls all the Christians
 <span class="lock"><i>Nozari</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_187" id="FNanchor_187">[187]</a></span>
 All the Gnostic sects equally
believed in magic. Irenæus, in describing the followers of Basilides,
says, “They use images, invocations, incantations, and all other things
pertaining unto magic.” Dunlap, on the authority of Lightfoot, shows
that Jesus was called <i>Nazaraios</i>, in reference to his humble and mean
external condition; “for Nazaraios means separation, alienation from
other <span class="lock">men.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_188" id="FNanchor_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The real meaning of the word nazar נזר signifies to vow or consecrate
one’s self to the service of God. As a noun it is a <i>diadem</i> or
emblem of such consecration, a head so
 <span class="lock">consecrated.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_189" id="FNanchor_189">[189]</a></span>
 Joseph was
styled a <i>nazar</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_190" id="FNanchor_190">[190]</a> “The head of Joseph, the vertex of the nazar among
his brethren.” Samson and Samuel (שמו־אל שצשון Semes-on and Semva-el)
are described alike as <i>nazars</i>. Porphyry, treating of Pythagoras,
says that he was purified and initiated at Babylon by Zar-adas, the head
of the sacred college. May it not be surmised, therefore, that the Zoro-Aster
was the <i>nazar</i> of Ishtar, Zar-adas or
 <span class="lock">Na-Zar-Ad,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_191" id="FNanchor_191">[191]</a></span>
 being the same
with change of idiom? Ezra, or עזרא, was a priest and scribe, a hierophant;
and the first Hebrew colonizer of Judea was זרובבל Zeru-Babel
or the Zoro or nazar of Babylon.</p>

<p>The Jewish Scriptures indicate two distinct worships and religions
among the Israelites; that of Bacchus-worship under the mask of Jehovah,
and that of the Chaldean initiates to whom belonged some of the
<i>nazars</i>, the theurgists, and a few of the prophets. The headquarters of
these were always at Babylon and Chaldea, where two rival schools of
Magians can be distinctly shown. Those who would doubt the statement
will have in such a case to account for the discrepancy between
history and Plato, who of all men of his day was certainly one of the
best informed. Speaking of the Magians, he shows them as instructing
the Persian kings of Zoroaster, as the son or priest of Oromasdes; and
yet Darius, in the inscription at Bihistun, boasts of having restored the
cultus of Ormazd and put down the Magian rites! Evidently there were
two distinct and antagonistic Magian schools. The oldest and the most
esoteric of the two being that which, satisfied with its unassailable knowledge
and secret power, was content to apparently relinquish her exoteric
popularity, and concede her supremacy into the hands of the reforming
Darius. The later Gnostics showed the same prudent policy by accommodating
themselves in every country to the prevailing religious forms,
still secretly adhering to their own essential doctrines.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
There is another hypothesis possible, which is that Zero-Ishtar was
the high priest of the Chaldean worship, or Magian hierophant. When
the Aryans of Persia, under Darius Hystaspes, overthrew the Magian
Gomates, and <em>restored</em> the Masdean worship, there ensued an amalgamation
by which the Magian Zoro-astar became the Zara-tushra of the
<cite>Vendidad</cite>. This was not acceptable to the other Aryans, who adopted
the Vedic religion as distinguished from that of <cite>Avesta</cite>. But this is but
an hypothesis.</p>

<p>And whatever Moses is now believed to have been, we will demonstrate
that he was an initiate. The Mosaic religion was at best a sun-and-serpent
worship, diluted, perhaps, with some slight monotheistic notions
before the latter were forcibly crammed into the so-called “inspired Scriptures”
by Ezra, at the time he was alleged to have <em>re</em>written the Mosaic
books. At all events the <cite>Book of Numbers</cite> was a later book; and there
the sun-and-serpent worship is as plainly traceable as in any Pagan story.
The tale of the fiery serpents is an allegory in more than one sense.
The “serpents” were the <i>Levites</i> or <i>Ophites</i>, who were Moses’ bodyguard
(see <cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="thirty-two">xxxii.</abbr> 26); and the command of the “Lord” to
Moses to hang the heads of the people “before the Lord against the
sun,” which is the emblem of this Lord, is unequivocal.</p>

<p>The nazars or prophets, as well as the Nazarenes, were an anti-Bacchus
caste, in so far that, in common with all the initiated prophets,
they held to the spirit of the symbolical religions and offered a strong
opposition to the idolatrous and exoteric practices of the dead letter.
Hence, the frequent stoning of the prophets by the populace and under
the leadership of those priests who made a profitable living out of the
popular superstitions. Otfried Müller shows how much the Orphic Mysteries
differed from the <em>popular</em> rites of
 <span class="lock">Bacchus,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_192" id="FNanchor_192">[192]</a></span>
 although the <i>Orphikoi</i>
are known to have followed the worship of Bacchus. The system of the
purest morality and of a severe asceticism promulgated in the teachings
of Orpheus, and so strictly adhered to by his votaries, are incompatible
with the lasciviousness and gross immorality of the popular rites. The
fable of Aristæus pursuing Eurydiké into the woods where a serpent occasions
her death, is a very plain allegory, which was in part explained at
the earliest times. Aristæus is <em>brutal power</em>, pursuing Eurydiké, the
esoteric doctrine, into the woods where the serpent (emblem of every
sun-god, and worshipped under its grosser aspect even by the Jews)
kills her; <i>i.e.</i>, forces truth to become still more esoteric, and seek
shelter in the Underworld, which is not the hell of our theologians.
Moreover, the fate of Orpheus, torn to pieces by the Bacchantes, is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span>
another allegory to show that the gross and popular rites are always
more welcome than divine but simple truth, and proves the great difference
that must have existed between the esoteric and the popular worship.
As the poems of both Orpheus and Musæus were said to have been
lost since the earliest ages, so that neither Plato nor Aristotle recognized
anything authentic in the poems extant in their time, it is difficult to say with
precision what constituted their peculiar rites. Still we have the oral tradition,
and every inference to draw therefrom; and this tradition points to
Orpheus as having brought his doctrines from India. As one whose
religion was that of the oldest Magians—hence, that to which belonged
the initiates of all countries, beginning with Moses, the “sons of the
Prophets,” and the ascetic <i>nazars</i> (who must not be confounded with
those against whom thundered Hosea and other prophets) to the Essenes.
This latter sect were Pythagoreans before they rather degenerated, than
became perfected in their system by the Buddhist missionaries, whom
Pliny tells us established themselves on the shores of the Dead Sea, ages
before his time, “<i lang="la">per sæculorum millia</i>.” But if, on the one hand, these
Buddhist monks were the first to establish monastic communities and inculcate
the strict observance of dogmatic conventual rule, on the other
they were also the first to enforce and popularize those stern virtues so
exemplified by Sakya-muni, and which were previously exercised only in
isolated cases of well-known philosophers and their followers; virtues
preached two or three centuries later by Jesus, practiced by a few Christian
ascetics, and gradually abandoned, and even entirely forgotten by
the Christian Church.</p>

<p>The <em>initiated</em> nazars had ever held to this rule, which had to be followed
before them by the adepts of every age; and the disciples of
John were but a dissenting branch of the Essenes. Therefore, we cannot
well confound them with all the nazars spoken of in the <cite>Old Testament</cite>,
and who are accused by Hosea with having separated or consecrated
themselves to <i>Bosheth</i> בשת (see Hebrew text); which implied the greatest
possible abomination. To infer, as some critics and theologians do,
that it means to separate one’s self to <em>chastity</em> or continence, is either to
advisedly pervert the true meaning, or to be totally ignorant of the
Hebrew language. The eleventh verse of the first chapter of Micah
half explains the word in its veiled translation: “Pass ye away, thou
inhabitant of Saphir, etc.,” and in the original text the word is <i>Bosheth</i>.
Certainly neither Baal, nor Iahoh Kadosh, with his <i>Kadeshim</i>, was a god
of ascetic virtue, albeit the <i>Septuaginta</i> terms them, as well as the <i>galli</i>—the
perfected priests—τετελεσμένους, the <em>initiated</em> and the <em>consecrated</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_193" id="FNanchor_193">[193]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
The great <cite>Sod</cite> of the <i>Kadeshim</i>, translated in <cite>Psalm</cite> <abbr title="eighty-nine">lxxxix.</abbr> 7, by
“assembly of the saints,” was anything but a mystery of the “<em>sanctified</em>”
in the sense given to the latter word by Webster.</p>

<p>The Nazireate sect existed long before the laws of Moses, and originated
among people most inimical to the “chosen” ones of Israel, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>,
the people of Galilee, the ancient <i lang="es">olla-podrida</i> of idolatrous nations,
where was built Nazara, the present Nazareth. It is in Nazara that the
ancient Nazorïa or Nazireates held their “Mysteries of Life” or “assemblies,”
as the word now stands in the
 <span class="lock">translation,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_194" id="FNanchor_194">[194]</a></span>
 which were but the
secret mysteries of
 <span class="lock">initiation,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_195" id="FNanchor_195">[195]</a></span>
 utterly distinct in their practical form
from the popular Mysteries which were held at Byblus in honor of Adonis.
While the true <em>initiates</em> of the ostracised Galilee were worshipping the
true God and enjoying transcendent visions, what were the “chosen”
ones about? Ezekiel tells it to us (<abbr title="chapter eight">chap. viii</abbr>) when, in describing what
he saw, he says that the <em>form</em> of a hand took him by a lock of his head
and transported him from Chaldea unto Jerusalem. “And there stood
seventy men of the senators of the house of Israel.... ‘Son of man,
hast thou seen what the ancients ... do in the dark?’” inquires the
“Lord.” “At the door of the house of the Lord ... behold there sat
women weeping for Tammuz” (Adonis). We really cannot suppose that
the Pagans have ever surpassed the “chosen” people in certain shameful
<em>abominations</em> of which their own prophets accuse them so profusely. To
admit this truth, one hardly needs even to be a Hebrew scholar; let him
read the <cite>Bible</cite> in English and meditate over the language of the “holy”
prophets.</p>

<p>This accounts for the hatred of the later Nazarenes for the orthodox
Jews—followers of the <em>exoteric</em> Mosaic Law—who are ever taunted by
this sect with being the worshippers of Iurbo-Adunai, or Lord Bacchus.
Passing under the disguise of <i>Adoni-Iachoh</i> (original text, <cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="sixty-one">lxi.</abbr> 1),
Iahoh and Lord Sabaoth, the Baal-Adonis, or Bacchus, worshipped in
the groves and <i>public sods</i> or Mysteries, under the polishing hand of Ezra
becomes finally the later-vowelled Adonai of the Massorah—the One
and Supreme God of the Christians!</p>

<p>“Thou shalt not worship the Sun who is named Adunai, says the
<cite>Codex</cite> of the Nazarenes; whose name is also
 <span class="lock"><i>Kadush</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_196" id="FNanchor_196">[196]</a></span>
 and El-El. This
Adunai will elect to himself a nation and congregate <em>in crowds</em> (his worship
will be exoteric) ... Jerusalem will become the refuge and city of
the <em>Abortive</em>, who shall perfect themselves (circumcise) with a sword
... and shall adore Adunai.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_197" id="FNanchor_197">[197]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>The oldest Nazarenes, who were the descendants of the Scripture
<i>nazars</i>, and whose last prominent leader was John the Baptist, although
never very orthodox in the sight of the scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem
were, nevertheless, respected and left unmolested. Even Herod “feared
the multitude” because they regarded John as a prophet (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="fourteen">xiv.</abbr>
5). But the followers of Jesus evidently adhered to a sect which became
a still more exasperating thorn in their side. It appeared as a heresy
<em>within</em> another heresy; for while the nazars of the olden times, the
“Sons of the Prophets,” were Chaldean kabalists, the adepts of the new
dissenting sect showed themselves reformers and innovators from the
first. The great similitude traced by some critics between the rites and
observances of the earliest Christians and those of the Essenes may be
accounted for without the slightest difficulty. The Essenes, as we remarked
just now, were the converts of Buddhist missionaries who had
overrun Egypt, Greece, and even Judea at one time, since the reign of
Asoka the zealous propagandist; and while it is evidently to the Essenes
that belongs the honor of having had the Nazarene reformer, Jesus, as
a pupil, still the latter is found disagreeing with his early teachers on
several questions of formal observance. He cannot strictly be called
an Essene, for reasons which we will indicate further on, neither was he
a nazar, or Nazaria of the older sect. What Jesus <em>was</em>, may be found in
the <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>, in the unjust accusations of the Bardesanian Gnostics.</p>

<p>“Jesu is <i>Nebu</i>, the false Messiah, the destroyer of the old orthodox
religion,” says the
 <span class="lock"><cite>Codex</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_198" id="FNanchor_198">[198]</a></span>
 He is the founder of the sect of the new
nazars, and, as the words clearly imply, a follower of the Buddhist
doctrine. In Hebrew the word <i>naba</i> נבא means to speak of inspiration;
and נבו is <i>nebo</i>, a god of wisdom. But Nebo is also <i>Mercury</i>, and <i>Mercury
is Buddha</i> in the Hindu monogram of planets. Moreover, we find
the Talmudists holding that Jesus was inspired by the genius of <span class="lock">Mercury.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_199" id="FNanchor_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nazarene reformer had undoubtedly belonged to one of these
sects; though, perhaps, it would be next to impossible to decide
absolutely which. But what is self-evident is that he preached the
philosophy of Buddha-Sakyamûni. Denounced by the later prophets,
cursed by the Sanhedrim, the nazars—they were confounded with others
of that name “who separated themselves unto that
 <span class="lock">shame,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_200" id="FNanchor_200">[200]</a></span>
 they were
secretly, if not openly persecuted by the orthodox synagogue. It becomes

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
clear why Jesus was treated with such contempt from the first,
and deprecatingly called “the Galilean.” Nathaniel inquires—“Can
there any good thing come out of Nazareth?” (<cite>John</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 46) at the very
beginning of his career; and merely because he knows him to be a
<i>nazar</i>. Does not this clearly hint, that even the older nazars were not
really Hebrew religionists, but rather a class of Chaldean theurgists?
Besides, as the <cite>New Testament</cite> is noted for its mistranslations and transparent
falsifications of texts, we may justly suspect that the word Nazareth
was substituted for that of <i>nasaria</i>, or nozari. That it originally read
“Can any good thing come from a nozari, or Nazarene;” a follower of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist, with whom we see him associating from his first
appearance on the stage of action, after having been lost sight of for a
period of nearly twenty years. The blunders of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> are
as nothing to those of the <em>gospels</em>. Nothing shows better than these self-evident
contradictions the system of pious fraud upon which the superstructure
of the Messiahship rests. “This <em>is Elias</em> which was for to
come,” says Matthew of John the Baptist, thus forcing an ancient kabalistic
tradition into the frame of evidence (<abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr> 14). But when addressing
the Baptist himself, they ask him (<cite>John</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 16), “Art thou Elias?”
“And he saith <cite>I am not</cite>!” Which knew best—John or his biographer?
And which is divine revelation?</p>

<p>The motive of Jesus was evidently like that of Gautama-Buddha, to
benefit humanity at large by producing a religious reform which should
give it a religion of pure ethics; the true knowledge of God and nature
having remained until then solely in the hands of the esoteric sects, and
their adepts. As Jesus used <em>oil</em> and the Essenes never used aught but
pure
 <span class="lock">water,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_201" id="FNanchor_201">[201]</a></span>
 he cannot be called a strict Essene. On the other hand,
the Essenes were also “set apart;” they were healers (<i>assaya</i>) and dwelt
in the desert as all ascetics did.</p>

<p>But although he did not abstain from wine he could have remained a
Nazarene all the same. For in chapter <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> of <cite>Numbers</cite>, we see that
after the priest has waved a part of the hair of a Nazorite for a wave-offering
before the Lord, “after that a Nazarene may drink wine”
(<abbr title="verse">v.</abbr> 20). The bitter denunciation by the reformer of the people who
would be satisfied with nothing is worded in the following exclamation:
“John came neither eating nor drinking and they say: ‘He hath a
devil.’... The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say:
‘Behold a man gluttonous and a wine-bibber.’” And yet he was an Essene
and Nazarene, for we not only find him sending a message to Herod, to
say that he was one of those who cast out demons, and who performed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
cures, but actually calling himself a prophet and declaring himself equal
to the other <span class="lock">prophets.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_202" id="FNanchor_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of <cite>Sod</cite> shows Matthew trying to connect the appellation
of Nazarene with a
 <span class="lock">prophecy,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_203" id="FNanchor_203">[203]</a></span>
 and inquires “Why then does
Matthew state that the prophet said he should be called <i>Nazaria</i>?”
Simply “because he belonged to that sect, and a prophecy would confirm
his claims to the Messiahship.... Now it does not appear that
the prophets anywhere state that the Messiah will be called a
 <span class="lock"><i>Nazarene</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_204" id="FNanchor_204">[204]</a></span>
The fact alone that Matthew tries in the last verse of chapter <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> to
strengthen his claim that Jesus dwelt in Nazareth <em>merely to fulfil a
prophecy</em>, does more than weaken the argument, it upsets it entirely; for
the first two chapters have sufficiently been proved later forgeries.</p>

<p>Baptism is one of the oldest rites and was practiced by all the nations
in their Mysteries, as sacred ablutions. Dunlap seems to derive the
name of the <i>nazars</i> from nazah, sprinkling; Bahak-Zivo is the genius
who called the world into
 <span class="lock">existence<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_205" id="FNanchor_205">[205]</a></span>
 out of the “dark water,” say the
Nazarenes; and Richardson’s <cite>Persian, Arabic, and English Lexicon</cite>
asserts that the word <i>Bahak</i> means “raining.” But the Bahak-Zivo of
the Nazarenes cannot be traced so easily to Bacchus, who “was the
rain-god,” for the nazars were the greatest opponents of Bacchus-worship.
“Bacchus is brought up by the Hyades, the rain-nymphs,” says
 <span class="lock">Preller;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_206" id="FNanchor_206">[206]</a></span>
 who shows, furthermore, that<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_207" id="FNanchor_207">[207]</a>
 at the conclusion of the religious
Mysteries, the priests baptized (washed) their monuments and anointed
them with oil. All this is but a very indirect proof. The Jordan baptism
need not be shown a substitution for the <em>exoteric</em> Bacchic rites and
the libations in honor of Adonis or Adoni—whom the Nazarenes abhorred—in
order to prove it to have been a sect sprung from the “Mysteries”
of the “Secret Doctrine;” and their rites can by no means be confounded
with those of the Pagan populace, who had simply fallen into the
idolatrous and unreasoning faith of all plebeian multitudes. John was the
prophet of these Nazarenes, and in Galilee he was termed “the Saviour,”
but he was not the founder of that sect which derived its tradition from
the remotest Chaldeo-Akkadian theurgy.</p>

<p>“The early plebeian Israelites were Canaanites and Phœnicians, with

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
the same worship of the Phallic gods—Bacchus, Baal or Adon, Iacchos—Iao
or Jehovah;” but even among them there had always been a
class of <i>initiated</i> adepts. Later, the character of this plebe was modified
by Assyrian conquests; and, finally, the Persian colonizations superimposed
the Pharisean and Eastern ideas and usages, from which the <cite>Old
Testament</cite> and the Mosaic institutes were derived. The Asmonean
priest-kings promulgated the canon of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> in contradistinction
to the <cite>Apocrypha</cite> or Secret Books of the Alexandrian Jews—kabalists.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_208" id="FNanchor_208">[208]</a>
Till John Hyrcanus they were Asideans (Chasidim) and
Pharisees (Parsees), but then they became Sadducees or Zadokites—asserters
of sacerdotal rule as contradistinguished from rabbinical. The
Pharisees were lenient and intellectual, the Sadducees, bigoted and cruel.</p>

<p>Says the <cite>Codex</cite>: “John, son of the Aba-Saba-Zacharia, conceived
by his mother <i>Anasabet</i> in her hundredth year, had baptized for <em>forty-two</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>years</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_209" id="FNanchor_209">[209]</a></span>
 when Jesu Messias came to the Jordan to be baptized with John’s
baptism.... But he will <em>pervert John’s doctrine</em>, changing the baptism
of the Jordan, and perverting the sayings of <span class="lock">justice.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_210" id="FNanchor_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The baptism was changed from <em>water</em> to that of the Holy Ghost, undoubtedly
in consequence of the ever-dominant idea of the Fathers to
institute a reform, and make the Christians distinct from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s
Nazarenes, the Nabatheans and Ebionites, in order to make room for
new dogmas. Not only do the Synoptics tell us that Jesus was baptizing
the same as John, but John’s own disciples complained of it, though surely
Jesus cannot be accused of following a purely Bacchic rite. The parenthesis
in verse <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr> of John <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr>, “... though Jesus himself baptized not,”
is so clumsy as to show upon its face that it is an interpolation.
Matthew makes John say that he that should come after him would not
baptize them with water “but with <em>the Holy Ghost</em> and fire.” Mark,
Luke, and John corroborate these words. Water, fire, and spirit, or Holy
Ghost, have all their origin in India, as we will show.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Now there is one very strange peculiarity about this sentence. It is
flatly denied in <cite>Acts</cite> <abbr title="nineteen">xix.</abbr> 2-5. Apollos, a Jew of Alexandria, belonged
to the sect of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s disciples; he had been baptized, and instructed
others in the doctrines of the Baptist. And yet when Paul, cleverly
profiting by his absence at Corinth, finds certain disciples of Apollos’
at Ephesus, and asks them whether they received <em>the Holy Ghost</em>,
he is naïvely answered, “We have not so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Ghost!” “Unto what then were you baptized?”
he inquires. “<cite>Unto John’s baptism</cite>,” they say. Then Paul is made to
repeat the words attributed to John by the Synoptics; and these men
“were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus,” exhibiting, moreover,
at the same instant, the usual polyglot gift which accompanies the descent
of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>How then? <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist, who is called the “precursor,” that
“the prophecy might be fulfilled,” the great prophet and martyr,
whose words ought to have had such an importance in the eyes of his
disciples, announces the “Holy Ghost” to his listeners; causes crowds
to assemble on the shores of the Jordan, where, at the great ceremony
of Christ’s baptism, the promised “Holy Ghost” appears within the
opened heavens, and the multitude hears the voice, and yet there are
disciples of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John who have “never so much
 as <em>heard</em> whether there be
any Holy Ghost!”</p>

<p>Verily the disciples who wrote the <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite> were right. Only
it is not Jesus himself, but those who came after him, and who concocted
the <cite>Bible</cite> to suit themselves, that “<em>perverted</em> John’s doctrine, <em>changed</em>
the baptism of the Jordan, and perverted the sayings of justice.”</p>

<p>It is useless to object that the present <cite>Codex</cite> was written centuries
after the direct apostles of John preached. So were our <cite>Gospels</cite>. When
this astounding interview of Paul with the “Baptists” took place, Bardesanes
had not yet appeared among them, and the sect was not considered
a “heresy.” Moreover, we are enabled to judge how little <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s
promise of the “Holy Ghost,” and the appearance of the “Ghost” himself,
had affected his disciples, by the displeasure shown by them toward the
disciples of Jesus, and the kind of rivalry manifested from the first. Nay,
so little is John himself sure of the identity of Jesus with the expected
Messiah, that after the famous scene of the baptism at the Jordan, and the
oral assurance by the <em>Holy Ghost</em> Himself that “<cite>This is my beloved Son</cite>”
(<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 17), we find “the Precursor,” in <cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>, sending
two of his disciples from his prison to inquire of Jesus: “Art thou <em>he</em>
that should come, or do we look <em>for another</em>!!”</p>

<p>This flagrant contradiction alone ought to have long ago satisfied
reasonable minds as to the putative divine inspiration of the <cite>New Testament</cite>.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
But we may offer another question: If baptism is the sign of
regeneration, and an ordinance instituted by Jesus, why do not Christians
now baptize as Jesus is here represented as doing, “with the Holy Ghost
and with fire,” instead of following the custom of the Nazarenes? In
making these palpable interpolations, what possible motive could Irenæus
have had except to cause people to believe that the appellation of Nazarene,
which Jesus bore, came only from his father’s residence at Nazareth,
and not from his affiliation with the sect of <i>Nazaria</i>, the healers?</p>

<p>This expedient of Irenæus was a most unfortunate one, for from time
immemorial the prophets of old had been thundering against the baptism
of fire as practiced by their neighbors, which imparted the “spirit of
prophecy,” or the Holy Ghost. But the case was desperate; the Christians
were universally called Nazoræns and Iessaens (according to Epiphanius),
and Christ simply ranked as a Jewish prophet and healer—so self-styled,
so accepted by his own disciples, and so regarded by their followers. In
such a state of things there was no room for either a new hierarchy or a
new God-head; and since Irenæus had undertaken the business of manufacturing
both, he had to put together such materials as were available,
and fill the gaps with his own fertile inventions.</p>

<p>To assure ourselves that Jesus was a true Nazarene—albeit with ideas
of a new reform—we must not search for the proof in the translated
<cite>Gospels</cite>, but in such original versions as are accessible. Tischendorf,
in his translation from the Greek of <cite>Luke</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 34, has it “Iesou Nazarene;”
and in the Syriac it reads “Iasoua, thou <i>Nazaria</i>.” Thus, if we take in
account all that is puzzling and incomprehensible in the four <cite>Gospels</cite>,
revised and corrected as they now stand, we shall easily see for ourselves
that the true, original Christianity, such as was preached by Jesus, is to
be found only in the so-called Syrian heresies. Only from them can we
extract any clear notions about what was primitive Christianity.
Such was the faith of Paul, when Tertullus the orator accused the apostle
before the governor Felix. What he complained of was that they had
found “that man a mover of sedition ... a ringleader of <em>the sect of the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Nazarenes</em>;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_211" id="FNanchor_211">[211]</a></span>
 and, while Paul denies every other accusation, he confesses
that “after the way which they call heresy, <em>so worship I the God of
my</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>fathers</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_212" id="FNanchor_212">[212]</a></span>
 This confession is a whole revelation. It shows: 1,
that Paul admitted belonging to the sect of the Nazarenes; 2, that he
worshipped the <em>God of his fathers</em>, not the trinitarian Christian God, of
whom he knows nothing, and who was not invented until after his death;
and, 3, that this unlucky confession satisfactorily explains why the treatise,
<cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite>, together with John’s <cite>Revelation</cite>, which at one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
period was utterly rejected, were kept out of the canon of the <cite>New Testament</cite>
for such a length of time.</p>

<p>At Byblos, the neophytes as well as the hierophants were, after participating
in the Mysteries, obliged to fast and remain in solitude for
some time. There was strict fasting and preparation before as well as
after the Bacchic, Adonian, and Eleusinian orgies; and Herodotus hints,
with fear and veneration about the <span class="allsmcap">LAKE</span> of Bacchus, in which “they
(the priests) made at night exhibitions of his life and
 <span class="lock">sufferings.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_213" id="FNanchor_213">[213]</a></span>
 In
the Mithraic sacrifices, during the initiation, a preliminary scene of death
was simulated by the neophyte, and it preceded the scene showing him
himself “being born again by the rite <em>of baptism</em>.” A portion of this
ceremony is still enacted in the present day by the Masons, when the
neophyte, as the Grand Master Hiram Abiff, lies dead, and is raised by
the strong grip of the lion’s paw.</p>

<p>The priests were circumcised. The neophyte could not be initiated
without having been present at the solemn Mysteries of the <span class="smcap">Lake</span>.
The Nazarenes were baptized in the Jordan; and could not be baptized
elsewhere; they were also circumcised, and had to fast before as well as
after the purification by baptism. Jesus is said to have fasted in the
wilderness for forty days, immediately after his baptism. To the present
day, there is outside every temple in India, a lake, stream, or a reservoir
full of holy water, in which the Brahmans and the Hindu devotees bathe
daily. Such places of consecrated water are necessary to every temple.
The bathing festivals, or <em>baptismal</em> rites, occur twice every year; in October
and April. Each lasts ten days; and, as in ancient Egypt and Greece,
the statues of their gods, goddesses, and idols are immersed in water
by the priests; the object of the ceremony being to wash away from
them the sins of their worshippers which they have taken upon themselves,
and which pollute them, until washed off by holy water.
During the Arâtty, the bathing ceremony, the principal god of every
temple is carried in solemn procession to be baptized in the sea. The
Brahman priests, carrying the sacred images, are followed generally by
the Maharajah—barefoot, and nearly naked. <em>Three times</em> the priests
enter the sea; the third time they carry with them the whole of the
images. Holding them up with prayers repeated by the whole congregation,
the Chief Priest plunges the statues of the gods <em>thrice</em> in the
name of the <em>mystic trinity</em>, into the water; after which they are purified.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_214" id="FNanchor_214">[214]</a>
The Orphic hymn calls <em>water</em> the greatest purifier of men and gods.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>Our Nazarene sect is known to have existed some 150 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
and to have lived on the banks of the Jordan, and on the eastern shore
of the Dead Sea, according to Pliny and
 <span class="lock">Josephus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_215" id="FNanchor_215">[215]</a></span>
 But in King’s
<cite>Gnostics</cite>, we find quoted another statement by Josephus from verse 13,
which says that the Essenes had been established on the shores of
the Dead Sea “for thousands of ages” before Pliny’s <span class="lock">time.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_216" id="FNanchor_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>According to Munk the term “Galilean” is nearly synonymous with
that of “Nazarene;” furthermore, he shows the relations of the former
with the Gentiles as very intimate. The populace had probably gradually
adopted, in their constant intercourse, certain rites and modes of
worship of the Pagans; and the scorn with which the Galileans were
regarded by the orthodox Jews is attributed by him to the same cause.
Their friendly relations had certainly led them, at a later period, to
adopt the “Adonia,” or the sacred rites over the body of the lamented
Adonis, as we find Jerome fairly lamenting this circumstance. “Over
Bethlehem,” he says, “the grove of Thammuz, that is of Adonis, was
casting its shadow! And in the <span class="allsmcap">GROTTO</span> where formerly the infant Jesus
cried, the lover of Venus was being <span class="lock">mourned.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_217" id="FNanchor_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>It was after the rebellion of Bar Cochba, that the Roman Emperor
established the Mysteries of Adonis at the Sacred Cave in Bethlehem;
and who knows but this was the <i>petra</i> or rock-temple on which the
church was built? The Boar of Adonis was placed above the gate of
Jerusalem which looked toward Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Munk says that the “Nazireate was an institution established before
the laws of
 <span class="lock">Musah.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_218" id="FNanchor_218">[218]</a></span>
 This is evident; as we find this sect not only
mentioned but minutely described in <cite>Numbers</cite> (<abbr title="chapter six">chap. vi.</abbr>). In the
commandment given in this chapter to Moses by the “Lord,” it is easy
to recognize the rites and laws of the Priests of
 <span class="lock">Adonis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_219" id="FNanchor_219">[219]</a></span>
 The abstinence
and purity strictly prescribed in both sects are identical. Both

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
allowed their hair <em>to grow</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>long</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_220" id="FNanchor_220">[220]</a></span>
 as the Hindu cœnobites and fakirs do
to this day, while other castes shave their hair and abstain on certain
days from wine. The prophet Elijah, a Nazarene, is described in
<cite>2 Kings</cite>, and by Josephus as “a hairy man girt with a girdle of leather.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_221" id="FNanchor_221">[221]</a>
And John the Baptist and Jesus are both represented as wearing very
long
 <span class="lock">hair.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_222" id="FNanchor_222">[222]</a></span>
 John is “clothed with camel’s hair” and wearing a girdle
of hide, and Jesus in a long garment “without any seams” ... “and
very white, like snow,” says Mark; the very dress worn by the Nazarene
Priests and the Pythagorean and Buddhist Essenes, as described by
Josephus.</p>

<p>If we carefully trace the terms <i>nazar</i>, and <i>nazaret</i>, throughout the
best known works of ancient writers, we will meet them in connection
with “Pagan” as well as Jewish adepts. Thus, Alexander Polyhistor
says of Pythagoras that he was a disciple of the Assyrian <i>Nazaret</i>, whom
some suppose to be Ezekiel. Diogenes Laërtius states most positively
that Pythagoras, after being initiated into all the Mysteries of the Greeks
and barbarians, “went into Egypt and afterward visited the Chaldeans
and Magi;” and Apuleius maintains that it was Zoroaster who instructed
Pythagoras.</p>

<p>Were we to suggest that the Hebrew <i>nazars</i>, the railing prophets of
the “Lord,” had been initiated into the so-called Pagan mysteries, and
belonged (or at least a majority of them) to the same Lodge or circle of
adepts as those who were considered idolaters; that their “circle of
prophets” was but a collateral branch of a secret association, which we
may well term “international,” what a visitation of Christian wrath would
we not incur! And still, the case looks strangely suspicious.</p>

<p>Let us first recall to our mind that which Ammianus Marcellinus, and
other historians relate of Darius Hystaspes. The latter, penetrating into
Upper India (Bactriana), learned pure rites, and stellar and cosmical
sciences from Brachmans, and communicated them to the Magi. Now
Hystaspes is shown in history to have crushed the Magi; and introduced—or
rather forced upon them—the pure religion of Zoroaster, that
of Ormazd. How is it, then, that an inscription is found on the tomb

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
of Darius, stating that he was “teacher and hierophant of magic, or
magianism?” Evidently there must be some historical mistake, and
history confesses it. In this imbroglio of names, Zoroaster, the teacher
and instructor of Pythagoras, can be neither the Zoroaster nor Zarathustra
who instituted sun-worship among the Parsees; nor he who appeared at
the court of Gushtasp (Hystaspes) the alleged father of Darius; nor,
again, the Zoroaster who placed his magi above the kings themselves.
The oldest Zoroastrian scripture—the <cite>Avesta</cite>—does not betray the
slightest traces of the reformer having ever been acquainted with any of
the nations that subsequently adopted his mode of worship. He seems
utterly ignorant of the neighbors of Western Iran, the Medes, the Assyrians,
the Persians, and others. If we had no other evidences of the great
antiquity of the Zoroastrian religion than the discovery of the blunder
committed by some scholars in our own century, who regarded King
Vistaspa (Gushtasp) as identical with the father of Darius, whereas the
Persian tradition points directly to Vistaspa as to the last of the line of
Kaianian princes who ruled in Bactriana, it ought to be enough, for the
Assyrian conquest of Bactriana took place 1,200 <span class="lock">years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_223" id="FNanchor_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Therefore, it is but natural that we should see in the appellation of
Zoroaster not a name but a generic term, whose significance must be left
to philologists to agree upon. <i>Guru</i>, in Sanscrit, is a spiritual teacher;
and as Zuruastara means in the same language he who worships the sun,
why is it impossible, that by some natural change of language, due to the
great number of different nations which were converted to the sun
worship, the word <i>guru-astara</i>, the spiritual teacher of sun-worship, so
closely resembling the name of the founder of this religion, became gradually
transformed in its primal form of Zuryastara or Zoroaster? The
opinion of the kabalists is that there was but one Zarathustra and many
<i>guruastars</i> or spiritual teachers, and that one such <i>guru</i>, or rather <em>huru</em>aster,
as he is called in the old manuscripts, was the instructor of Pythagoras.
To philology and our readers we leave the explanation for what it
is worth. Personally we believe in it, as we credit on this subject kabalistic
tradition far more than the explanation of scientists, no two of
whom have been able to agree up to the present year.</p>

<p>Aristotle states that Zoroaster lived 6,000 years before Christ; Hermippus
of Alexandria, who is said to have read the genuine books of the
Zoroastrians, although Alexander the Great is accused of having destroyed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
them, shows Zoroaster as the pupil of Azonak (Azon-ach, or the Azon-God)
and as having lived 5,000 years before the fall of Troy. Er or Eros,
whose vision is related by Plato in the <cite>Republic</cite>, is declared by Clement
to have been Zordusth. While the Magus who dethroned Cambyses
was a Mede, and Darius proclaims that he put down the Magian rites to
establish those of Ormazd, Xanthus of Lydia declares Zoroaster to have
been the chief of the Magi!</p>

<p>Which of them is wrong? or are they all right, and only the modern
interpreters fail to explain the difference between the Reformer and his
apostles and followers? This blundering of our commentators reminds us
of that of Suetonius, who mistook the Christians for one Christos, or
<i>Crestos</i>, as he spells it, and assured his readers that Claudius banished
him for the disturbance he made among the Jews.</p>

<p>Finally, and to return again to the <i>nazars</i>, Zaratus is mentioned by
Pliny in the following words: “He was Zoroaster and <i>Nazaret</i>.” As
Zoroaster is called <i>princeps</i> of the Magi, and <i>nazar</i> signifies separated or
consecrated, is it not a Hebrew rendering of <i>mag</i>? Volney believes so.
The Persian word <i>Na-zaruan</i> means millions of years, and refers to the
Chaldean “Ancient of Days.” Hence the name of the Nazars or Nazarenes,
who were consecrated to the service of the Supreme one God, the
kabalistic En-Soph, or the Ancient of Days, the “Aged of the aged.”</p>

<p>But the word <i>nazar</i> may also be found in India. In Hindustani
<i>nazar</i> is sight, internal or <i>supernatural</i> vision; <i>nazar band-ī</i> means fascination,
a mesmeric or magical spell; and <i>nazarān</i> is the word for sightseeing
or vision.</p>

<p>Professor Wilder thinks that as the word <i>Zeruana</i> is nowhere to be
found in the <cite>Avesta</cite>, but only in the later Parsi books, it came from the
Magians, who composed the Persian sacred caste in the Sassan period,
but were originally Assyrians. “Turan, of the poets,” he says, “I consider
to be Aturia, or Assyria; and that Zohak (Az-dahaka, Dei-okes, or
Astyages), the Serpent-king, was Assyrian, Median, and Babylonian—when
those countries were united.”</p>

<p>This opinion does not, however, in the least implicate our statement
that the secret doctrines of the Magi, of the pre-Vedic Buddhists, of the
hierophants of the Egyptian Thoth or Hermes, and of the adepts of whatever
age and nationality, including the Chaldean kabalists and the Jewish
<i>nazars</i>, were <em>identical</em> from the beginning. When we use the term <i>Buddhists</i>,
we do not mean to imply by it either the exoteric Buddhism instituted
by the followers of Gautama-Buddha, nor the modern Buddhistic
religion, but the secret philosophy of Sakyamuni, which in its essence is
certainly identical with the ancient wisdom-religion of the sanctuary, the
pre-Vedic Brahmanism. The “schism” of Zoroaster, as it is called, is a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
direct proof of it. For it was no <em>schism</em>, strictly speaking, but merely a
partially-public exposition of strictly monotheistic religious truths, hitherto
taught only in the sanctuaries, and that he had learned from the Brahmans.
Zoroaster, the primeval institutor of sun-worship, cannot be called
the founder of the dualistic system; neither was he the first to teach the
unity of God, for he taught but what he had learned himself with the
Brahmans. And that Zarathustra and his followers, the Zoroastrians,
“had been settled in India before they immigrated into Persia,” is also
proved by Max Müller. “That the Zoroastrians and their ancestors
started from India,” he says, “during the Vaidik period, can be proved
as distinctly as that the inhabitants of Massilia started from Greece....
Many of the gods of the Zoroastrians come out ... as mere reflections
and deflections of the primitive and authentic gods of the <span class="lock"><cite>Veda</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_224" id="FNanchor_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>If, now, we can prove—and we can do so on the evidence of the
<cite>Kabala</cite> and the oldest traditions of the wisdom-religion, the philosophy
of the old sanctuaries—that all these gods, whether of the Zoroastrians
or of the <cite>Veda</cite>, are but so many personated <em>occult powers</em> of nature, the
faithful servants of the adepts of secret wisdom—Magic—we are on
secure ground.</p>

<p>Thus, whether we say that Kabalism and Gnosticism proceeded from
Masdeanism or Zoroastrianism, it is all the same, unless we meant the
<em>exoteric</em> worship—which we do not. Likewise, and in this sense, we may
echo King, the author of the <cite>Gnostics</cite>, and several other archæologists,
and maintain that both the former proceeded from <i>Buddhism</i>, at once
the simplest and most satisfying of philosophies, and which resulted
in one of the purest religions of the world. It is only a matter of chronology
to decide which of these religions, differing but in external form,
is the oldest, therefore the least adulterated. But even this bears but very
indirectly, if at all, on the subject we treat of. Already some time before
our era, the adepts, except in India, had ceased to congregate in large
communities; but whether among the Essenes, or the Neo-platonists, or,
again, among the innumerable struggling sects born but to die, the same
doctrines, identical in substance and spirit, if not always in form, are
encountered. By <i>Buddhism</i>, therefore, we mean that religion signifying
literally the doctrine of wisdom, and which by many ages antedates the
metaphysical philosophy of Siddhârtha Sakyamuni.</p>

<p>After nineteen centuries of enforced eliminations from the canonical
books of every sentence which might put the investigator on the true path,
it has become very difficult to show, to the satisfaction of exact science,
that the “Pagan” worshippers of Adonis, their neighbors, the Nazarenes,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
and the Pythagorean Essenes, the healing
 <span class="lock">Therapeutes,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_225" id="FNanchor_225">[225]</a></span>
 the Ebionites,
and other sects, were all, with very slight differences, followers of
the ancient theurgic Mysteries. And yet by analogy and a close study
of the <em>hidden</em> sense of their rites and customs, we can trace their kinship.</p>

<p>It was given to a contemporary of Jesus to become the means of
pointing out to posterity, by his interpretation of the oldest literature of
Israel, how deeply the kabalistic philosophy agreed in its esoterism with
that of the profoundest Greek thinkers. This contemporary, an ardent
disciple of Plato and Aristotle, was Philo Judæus. While explaining the
Mosaic books according to a purely kabalistic method, he is the famous
Hebrew writer whom Kingsley calls the Father of New Platonism.</p>

<p>It is evident that Philo’s Therapeutes are a branch of the Essenes.
Their name indicates it—Ἐσσαῖοι, <i>Asaya</i>, physician. Hence, the contradictions,
forgeries, and other desperate expedients to reconcile the
prophecies of the Jewish canon with the Galilean nativity and godship.</p>

<p>Luke, who was a physician, is designated in the Syriac texts as
<i>Asaia</i>, the Essaian or Essene. Josephus and Philo Judæus have sufficiently
described this sect to leave no doubt in our mind that the Nazarene
Reformer, after having received his education in their dwellings in
the desert, and been duly initiated in the Mysteries, preferred the free
and independent life of a wandering <i>Nazaria</i>, and so separated or <i>inazarenized</i>
himself from them, thus becoming a travelling Therapeute, a
Nazaria, a healer. Every Therapeute, before quitting his community,
had to do the same. Both Jesus and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist preached the
end of the
 <span class="lock">Age;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_226" id="FNanchor_226">[226]</a></span>
 which proves their knowledge of the secret computation
of the priests and kabalists, who with the chiefs of the Essene communities
alone had the secret of the duration of the cycles. The latter
were kabalists and theurgists; “they had their <em>mystic</em> books, and predicted
future events,” says <span class="lock">Munk.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_227" id="FNanchor_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Dunlap, whose personal researches seem to have been quite successful
in that direction, traces the Essenes, Nazarenes, Dositheans, and some
other sects as having all existed before Christ: “They rejected pleasures,
<em>despised riches</em>, <em>loved one another</em>, and more than other sects, neglected

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
wedlock, deeming the conquest of the passions to be virtuous,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_228" id="FNanchor_228">[228]</a>
he says.</p>

<p>These are all virtues preached by Jesus; and if we are to take the
gospels as a standard of truth, Christ was a metempsychosist “or <i>re-incarnationist</i>—again
like these same Essenes, whom we see were Pythagoreans
in all their doctrines and habits. Iamblichus asserts that the
Samian philosopher spent a certain time at Carmel with
 <span class="lock">them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_229" id="FNanchor_229">[229]</a></span>
 In his
discourses and sermons, Jesus always spoke in parables and used metaphors
with his audience. This habit was again that of the Essenians
and the Nazarenes; the Galileans who dwelt in cities and villages were
never known to use such allegorical language. Indeed, some of his
disciples being Galileans as well as himself, felt even surprised to find
him using with the people such a form of expression. “Why speakest
thou unto them in
 <span class="lock">parables?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_230" id="FNanchor_230">[230]</a></span>
 they often inquired. “Because, it is
given unto you to know the Mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to
them it is not given,” was the reply, which was that of an initiate.
“Therefore, I speak unto them in parables; because, they seeing, see
not, and hearing, they hear not, neither do they understand.” Moreover,
we find Jesus expressing his thoughts still clearer—and in sentences
which are purely Pythagorean—when, during the <cite>Sermon on the Mount</cite>,
he says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Give ye not that which is sacred to the dogs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither cast ye your pearls before swine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For the swine will tread them under their feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the dogs will turn and rend you.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Professor A. Wilder, the editor of Taylor’s <cite>Eleusinian Mysteries</cite>,
observes “a like disposition on the part of Jesus and Paul to classify
their doctrines as esoteric and exoteric, the Mysteries of the Kingdom of
God ‘for the apostles,’ and ‘parables’ for the multitude. ‘We speak
wisdom,’ says Paul, ‘among them that <em>are perfect</em>’ (or <span class="lock">initiated).”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_231" id="FNanchor_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Eleusinian and other Mysteries the participants were always
divided into two classes, the <i>neophytes</i> and the <i>perfect</i>. The former
were sometimes admitted to the preliminary initiation: the dramatic
performance of Ceres, or the soul, descending to
 <span class="lock">Hades.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_232" id="FNanchor_232">[232]</a></span>
 But it was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
given only to the “<em>perfect</em>” to enjoy and learn the Mysteries of the
divine <i>Elysium</i>, the celestial abode of the blessed; this Elysium being
unquestionably the same as the “Kingdom of Heaven.” To contradict
or reject the above, would be merely to shut one’s eyes to the truth.</p>

<p>The narrative of the Apostle Paul, in his second <cite>Epistle to the Corinthians</cite>
(<abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 3, 4), has struck several scholars, well versed in the
descriptions of the mystical rites of the initiation given by some
classics, as alluding most undoubtedly to the final <i>Epopteia</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_233" id="FNanchor_233">[233]</a> “I knew
a certain man—<em>whether in body or outside of body</em>, I know not: God
knoweth—who was rapt into Paradise, and heard things ineffable αρρητα ρηματα,
 <em>which it is not lawful for a man to repeat</em>.” These words have
rarely, so far as we know, been regarded by commentators as an
allusion to the beatific visions of an “<em>initiated</em>” seer. But the phraseology
is unequivocal. These things “<em>which it is not lawful to repeat</em>,”
are hinted at in the same words, and the reason for it assigned, is the
same as that which we find repeatedly expressed by Plato, Proclus,
Iamblichus, Herodotus, and other classics. “We speak <span class="allsmcap">WISDOM</span> only
among them who are <span class="allsmcap">PERFECT</span>,” says Paul; the plain and undeniable
translation of the sentence being: “We speak of the profounder (or
final) esoteric doctrines of the Mysteries (which were denominated <em>wisdom</em>)
only among them who are
 <span class="lock"><em>initiated</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_234" id="FNanchor_234">[234]</a></span>
 So in relation to the “man
who was rapt into Paradise”—and who was evidently Paul himself<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_235" id="FNanchor_235">[235]</a>—the
Christian word Paradise having replaced that of Elysium. To
complete the proof, we might recall the words of Plato, given elsewhere,
which show that before an initiate could see the gods in their
purest light, he had to become <em>liberated</em> from his body; <i>i.e.</i>, to separate
his astral soul from
 <span class="lock">it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_236" id="FNanchor_236">[236]</a></span>
 Apuleius also describes his initiation into the
Mysteries in the same way: “I approached the confines of death; and,
having trodden on the threshold of Proserpina, returned, having been
carried through all the elements. In the depths of midnight I saw the
sun glittering with a splendid light, together with <em>the infernal and supernal
gods</em>, and to these divinities approaching, I paid the tribute of devout
<span class="lock">adoration.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_237" id="FNanchor_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>

Thus, in common with Pythagoras and other hierophant reformers,
Jesus divided his teachings into exoteric and esoteric. Following
faithfully the Pythagoreo-Essenean ways, he never sat at a meal without
saying “grace.” “The priest prays before his meal,” says Josephus,
describing the Essenes. Jesus also divided his followers into “neophytes,”
“brethren,” and the “perfect,” if we may judge by the difference
he made between them. But his career at least as a public Rabbi,
was of a too short duration to allow him to establish a regular school of
his own; and with the exception, perhaps, of John, it does not seem that
he had initiated any other apostle. The Gnostic amulets and talismans are
mostly the emblems of the apocalyptic allegories. The “seven vowels”
are closely related to the “seven seals;” and the mystic title Abraxas,
partakes as much of the compositian of <i>Shem Hamphirosh</i>, “the holy
word” or ineffable name, as the name called: The word of God, that
“<cite>no man knew but he</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>himself</cite>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_238" id="FNanchor_238">[238]</a></span>
 as John expresses it.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to escape from the well-adduced proofs that the
<cite>Apocalypse</cite> is the production of an initiated kabalist, when this <cite>Revelation</cite>
presents whole passages taken from the <cite>Books of Enoch</cite> and <cite>Daniel</cite>,
which latter is in itself an abridged imitation of the former; and when,
furthermore, we ascertain that the Ophite Gnostics who rejected the <cite>Old
Testament</cite> entirely, as “emanating from an inferior being (Jehovah),”
accepted the most ancient prophets, such as Enoch, and deduced the
strongest support from this book for their religious tenets, the demonstration
becomes evident. We will show further how closely related are all
these doctrines. Besides, there is the history of Domitian’s persecutions
of magicians and philosophers, which affords as good a proof as any that
John was generally considered a kabalist. As the apostle was included
among the number, and, moreover, conspicuous, the imperial edict banished
him not only from Rome, but even from the continent. It was
not the Christians whom—confounding them with the Jews, as some historians
will have it—the emperor persecuted, but the astrologers and
 <span class="lock">kabalists.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_239" id="FNanchor_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>The accusations against Jesus of practicing the magic of Egypt were
numerous, and at one time universal, in the towns where he was known.
The Pharisees, as claimed in the <cite>Bible</cite>, had been the first to fling it in his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
face, although Rabbi Wise considers Jesus himself a Pharisee. The <cite>Talmud</cite>
certainly points to James the Just as one of that
 <span class="lock">sect.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_240" id="FNanchor_240">[240]</a></span>
 But these
partisans are known to have always stoned every prophet who denounced
their evil ways, and it is not on this fact that we base our assertion.
These accused him of sorcery, and of driving out devils by Beelzebub,
their prince, with as much justice as later the Catholic clergy had to
accuse of the same more than one innocent martyr. But Justin Martyr
states on better authority that the men of his time <em>who were not Jews</em>
asserted that the miracles of Jesus were performed by magical art—μαγικὴ φαντασία—the
very expression used by the skeptics of those
days to designate the feats of thaumaturgy accomplished in the Pagan
temples. “They even ventured to call him a magician and a deceiver of
the people,” complains the martyr.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_241" id="FNanchor_241">[241]</a>
 In the <cite>Gospel of Nicodemus</cite> (the
<i>Acta Pilate</i>), the Jews bring the same accusation before Pilate. “Did
we not tell thee he was a magician?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_242" id="FNanchor_242">[242]</a>
 Celsus speaks of the same charge,
and as a Neo-platonist believes in it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_243" id="FNanchor_243">[243]</a>
 The Talmudic literature is full
of the most minute particulars, and their greatest accusation is that “Jesus
could fly as easily in the air as others could walk.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_244" id="FNanchor_244">[244]</a>
 <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austin asserted
that it was generally believed that he had been initiated in Egypt, and
that he wrote books concerning magic, which he delivered to
 John.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_245" id="FNanchor_245">[245]</a>
There was a work called <cite lang="la">Magia Jesu Christi</cite>, which was attributed to
Jesus<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_246" id="FNanchor_246">[246]</a>
 himself. In the <cite>Clementine Recognitions</cite> the charge is brought
against Jesus that he did not perform his miracles as a Jewish prophet,
but as a magician, <i>i.e.</i>, an initiate of the “heathen”
 <span class="lock">temples.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_247" id="FNanchor_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>It was usual then, as it is now, among the intolerant clergy of
opposing religions, as well as among the lower classes of society, and
even among those patricians who, for various reasons had been excluded
from any participation of the Mysteries, to accuse, sometimes, the highest
hierophants and adepts of sorcery and black magic. So Apuleius, who

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
had been initiated, was likewise accused of witchcraft, and of carrying
about him the figure of a skeleton—a potent agent, as it is asserted, in
the operations of the black art. But one of the best and most unquestionable
proofs of our assertion may be found in the so-called <i>Museo
Gregoriano</i>. On the sarcophagus, which is panelled with bas-reliefs
representing the miracles of
 <span class="lock">Christ,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_248" id="FNanchor_248">[248]</a></span>
 may be seen the full figure
of Jesus, who, in the resurrection of Lazarus, appears beardless “and
equipped with a wand in the received guise of a <em>necromancer</em> (<i>?</i>) whilst
the corpse of Lazarus is swathed in bandages exactly as an Egyptian
mummy.”</p>

<p>Had posterity been enabled to have several such representations
executed during the first century when the figure, dress, and every-day
habits of the Reformer were still fresh in the memory of his contemporaries,
perhaps the Christian world would be more Christ-like; the dozens
of contradictory, groundless, and utterly meaningless speculations about
the “Son of Man” would have been impossible; and humanity would now
have but one religion and one God. It is this absence of all proof, the
lack of the least positive clew about him whom Christianity has deified,
that has caused the present state of perplexity. No pictures of
Christ were possible until after the days of Constantine, when the Jewish
element was nearly eliminated among the followers of the new religion.
The Jews, apostles, and disciples, whom the Zoroastrians and the Parsees
had inoculated with a holy horror of any form of images, would have
considered it a sacrilegious blasphemy to represent in any way or shape
their master. The only authorized image of Jesus, even in the days of
Tertullian, was an allegorical representation of the “Good Shepherd,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_249" id="FNanchor_249">[249]</a>
which was no portrait, but the figure of a man with a jackal-head, like
 <span class="lock">Anubis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_250" id="FNanchor_250">[250]</a></span>
 On this gem, as seen in the collection of Gnostic amulets, the
Good Shepherd bears upon his shoulders the lost lamb. He seems to
have a human head upon his neck; but, as King correctly observes, “it
only <em>seems so</em> to the uninitiated eye.” On closer inspection, he becomes
the double-headed Anubis, having one head human, the other a jackal’s,
whilst his girdle assumes the form of a serpent rearing aloft its crested
head. “This figure,” adds the author of the <cite>Gnostics</cite>, etc., “had two
meanings—one obvious for the vulgar; the other mystical, and recognizable
by the <em>initiated alone</em>. It was perhaps the signet of some chief

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
teacher or
 <span class="lock">apostle.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_251" id="FNanchor_251">[251]</a></span>
 This affords a fresh proof that the Gnostics and
early <em>orthodox</em> (?) Christians were not so wide apart in their <i>secret doctrine</i>.
King deduces from a quotation from <cite>Epiphanius</cite>, that even as
late as 400 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> it was considered an atrocious sin to attempt to represent
the bodily appearance of Christ.
 <span class="lock">Epiphanius<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_252" id="FNanchor_252">[252]</a></span>
 brings it as an idolatrous
charge against the Carpocratians that “they kept painted portraits,
and <em>even gold and silver images</em>, and <em>in other materials</em>, which they
pretended to be portraits of Jesus, and made by Pilate after the likeness
of Christ.... These they keep in secret, along with Pythagoras, Plato,
and Aristotle, and setting them all up together, they worship and offer
sacrifices unto them <em>after the Gentiles’ fashion</em>.”</p>

<p>What would the pious Epiphanius say were he to resuscitate and
step into <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s Cathedral at Rome! Ambrosius seems also very
desperate at the idea—that some persons fully credited the statement
of Lampridius that Alexander Severus had in his private chapel an
image of Christ among other great philosophers. “That the Pagans
should have preserved the likeness of Christ,” he exclaims, “but the
disciples have neglected to do so, is a notion the mind shudders to
entertain, much less to believe.”</p>

<p>All this points undeniably to the fact, that except a handful of self-styled
Christians who subsequently won the day, all the civilized portion
of the Pagans who knew of Jesus honored him as a philosopher, an <em>adept</em>
whom they placed on the same level with Pythagoras and Apollonius.
Whence such a veneration on their part for a man, were he simply, as
represented by the Synoptics, a poor, unknown Jewish carpenter from
Nazareth? As an incarnated God there is no single record of him on
this earth capable of withstanding the critical examination of science; as
one of the greatest reformers, an inveterate enemy of every theological
dogmatism, a persecutor of bigotry, a teacher of one of the most sublime
codes of ethics, Jesus is one of the grandest and most clearly-defined
figures on the panorama of human history. His age may, with every day,
be receding farther and farther back into the gloomy and hazy mists of
the past; and his theology—based on human fancy and supported by
untenable dogmas may, nay, must with every day lose more of its unmerited
prestige; alone the grand figure of the philosopher and moral
reformer instead of growing paler will become with every century more
pronounced and more clearly defined. It will reign supreme and universal
only on that day when the whole of humanity recognizes but one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
father—the <span class="allsmcap">UNKNOWN ONE</span> above—and one brother—the whole of mankind
below.</p>

<p>In a pretended letter of Lentulus, a senator and a distinguished historian,
to the Roman senate, there is a description of the personal appearance
of Jesus. The letter itself, written in horrid Latin, is pronounced
a bare-faced forgery; but we find therein an expression which
suggests many thoughts. Albeit a forgery it is evident that whosoever
invented it has nevertheless tried to follow tradition as closely as possible.
The hair of Jesus is represented in it as “wavy and curling ...
flowing down upon his shoulders,” and as “<cite>having a parting in the middle
of the head after the fashion of the Nazarenes</cite>.” This last sentence
shows: 1. That there was such a tradition, based on the biblical description
of John the Baptist, the <i>Nazaria</i>, and the custom of this sect.
2. Had Lentulus been the author of this letter, it is difficult to believe
that Paul should never have heard of it; and had he known its contents,
he would never have pronounced it a <em>shame</em> for men to wear their hair
 <span class="lock">long,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_253" id="FNanchor_253">[253]</a></span>
 thus shaming his Lord and Christ-God. 3. If Jesus did wear his
hair long and parted in the middle of the forehead, after the fashion of
the Nazarenes (as well as John, the only one of his apostles who followed
it), then we have one good reason more to say that Jesus must
have belonged to the sect of the Nazarenes, and been called
 <span class="smcap">Nasaria</span>
for this reason and not because he was an inhabitant of Nazareth; for
they never wore their hair long. The Nazarite, who <em>separated</em> himself
unto the Lord, allowed “no razor to come upon his head.” “He shall
be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow,” says <cite>Numbers</cite>
(<abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 5). Samson was a Nazarite, <i>i.e.</i>, vowed to the service of God,
and in his hair was his strength. “No razor shall come upon his head;
the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb” (<cite>Judges</cite>
 <abbr title="thirteen">xiii.</abbr> 5).
But the final and most reasonable conclusion to be inferred from this is
that Jesus, who was so opposed to all the orthodox Jewish practices, would
<em>not</em> have allowed his hair to grow had he not belonged to this sect, which
in the days of John the Baptist had already become a heresy in the eyes
of the Sanhedrim. The <cite>Talmud</cite>, speaking of the Nazaria, or the Nazarenes
(who had abandoned the world like Hindu yogis or hermits) calls
them a sect of physicians, of wandering exorcists; as also does Jervis.
“They went about the country, living on alms and performing
 cures.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_254" id="FNanchor_254">[254]</a>
Epiphanius says that the Nazarenes come next in heresy to the Corinthians
whether having existed “before them or after them, nevertheless
<i>synchronous</i>,” and then adds that “all Christians at that time were
equally called <span class="lock"><i>Nazarenes</i>!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_255" id="FNanchor_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
In the very first remark made by Jesus about John the Baptist, we
find him stating that he is “Elias, which was for to come.” This assertion,
if it is not a later interpolation for the sake of having a prophecy fulfilled,
means again that Jesus was a kabalist; unless indeed we have to
adopt the doctrine of the French spiritists and suspect him of believing
in reïncarnation. Except the kabalistic sects of the Essenes, the Nazarenes,
the disciples of Simeon Ben Iochaï, and Hillel, neither the orthodox
Jews, nor the Galileans, believed or knew anything about the doctrine
of <em>permutation</em>. And the Sadducees rejected even that of the resurrection.</p>

<p>“But the author of this <i lang="la">restitutionis</i> was Mosah, our master, upon
whom be peace! Who was the <i lang="la">revolutio</i> (transmigration) of Seth and
Hebel, that he might cover the nudity of his Father Adam—<i lang="la">Primus</i>,” says
the <cite>Kabala</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_256" id="FNanchor_256">[256]</a>
 Thus, Jesus hinting that John was the <i lang="la">revolutio</i>, or transmigration
of Elias, seems to prove beyond any doubt the school to
which he belonged.</p>

<p>Until the present day uninitiated Kabalists and Masons believe permutation
to be synonymous with transmigration and metempsychosis.
But they are as much mistaken in regard to the doctrine of the true
Kabalists as to that of the Buddhists. True, the <cite>Sohar</cite> says in one
place, “All souls are subject to transmigration ... men do not know the
ways of the Holy One, blessed be He; they do not know that they are
brought before the tribunal, both before they enter this world and after
they quit it,” and the Pharisees also held this doctrine, as Josephus
shows (<cite>Antiquities</cite>, <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 13). Also the doctrine of Gilgul, held to the
strange theory of the “Whirling of the Soul,” which taught that the
bodies of Jews buried far away from the Holy Land, still preserve a particle
of soul which can neither rest nor quit them, until it reaches the
soil of the “Promised Land.” And this “whirling” process was
thought to be accomplished by the soul being conveyed back through an
actual evolution of species; transmigrating from the minutest insect up
to the largest animal. But this was an <em>exoteric</em> doctrine. We refer the
reader to the <cite>Kabbala Denudata</cite> of Henry Khunrath; his language, however
obscure, may yet throw some light upon the subject.</p>

<p>But this doctrine of permutation, or <i lang="la">revolutio</i>, must not be understood
as a belief in reïncarnation. That Moses was considered the transmigration
of Abel and Seth, does not imply that the kabalists—those who were
<em>initiated</em> at least—believed that the identical spirit of either of Adam’s
sons reappeared under the corporeal form of Moses. It only shows what
was the mode of expression they used when hinting at one of the profoundest
mysteries of the Oriental Gnosis, one of the most majestic articles

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
of faith of the Secret Wisdom. It was purposely veiled so as to half
conceal and half reveal the truth. It implied that Moses, like certain
other god-like men, was believed to have reached the highest of all
states on earth:—the rarest of all psychological phenomena, the perfect
union of the immortal spirit with the terrestrial <em>duad</em> had occurred. The
trinity was complete. A <em>god</em> was incarnate. But how rare such incarnations!</p>

<p>That expression, “Ye are gods,” which, to our biblical students, is a
mere abstraction, has for the kabalists a vital significance. Each immortal
spirit that sheds its radiance upon a human being is a god—the Microcosmos
of the Macrocosmos, part and parcel of the Unknown God, the
First Cause of which it is a direct emanation. It is possessed of all the
attributes of its parent source. Among these attributes are omniscience
and omnipotence. Endowed with these, but yet unable to fully manifest
them while in the body, during which time they are obscured, veiled,
limited by the capabilities of physical nature, the thus divinely-inhabited
man may tower far above his kind, evince a god-like wisdom, and
display deific powers; for while the rest of mortals around him are but
<em>overshadowed</em> by their divine <span class="allsmcap">SELF</span>,
 with every chance given to them to
become immortal hereafter, but no other security than their personal
efforts to win the kingdom of heaven, the so chosen man has already become
an immortal while yet on earth. His prize is secured. Henceforth
he will live forever in eternal life. Not only he may have
 “dominion”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_257" id="FNanchor_257">[257]</a>
over all the works of creation by employing the “excellence” of the
<span class="allsmcap">NAME</span> (the ineffable one) but be higher
 in this life, not, as Paul is made
to say, “a little lower than the <span class="lock">angels.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_258" id="FNanchor_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The ancients never entertained the sacrilegious thought that such
perfected entities were incarnations of the One Supreme and for ever
invisible God. No such profanation of the awful Majesty entered into
their conceptions. Moses and his antitypes and types were to them but
complete men, gods on earth, for their <em>gods</em> (divine spirits) had entered
unto their hallowed tabernacles, the purified physical bodies. The disembodied
spirits of the heroes and sages were termed gods by the
ancients. Hence, the accusation of polytheism and idolatry on the part
of those who were the first to anthropomorphize the holiest and purest
abstractions of their forefathers.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
The real and hidden sense of this doctrine was known to all the initiates.
The Tanaïm imparted it to their elect ones, the Isarim, in the
solemn solitudes of crypts and deserted places. It was one of the most
esoteric and jealously guarded, for human nature was the same then as
it is now, and the sacerdotal caste as confident as now in the supremacy
of its knowledge, and ambitious of ascendency over the weaker masses;
with the difference perhaps that its hierophants could prove the legitimacy
of their claims and the plausibility of their doctrines, whereas now,
<em>believers</em> must be content with blind faith.</p>

<p>While the kabalists called this mysterious and rare occurrence of the
union of spirit with the mortal charge entrusted to its care, the “descent
of the Angel Gabriel” (the latter being a kind of generic name for it), the
<i>Messenger of Life</i>, and the angel Metatron; and while the Nazarenes
termed the same
 <span class="lock">Abel-Zivo,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_259" id="FNanchor_259">[259]</a></span>
 the <i>Delegatus</i> sent by the Lord of Celsitude,
it was universally known as the “Anointed Spirit.”</p>

<p>Thus it is the acceptation of this doctrine which caused the Gnostics
to maintain that Jesus was a man overshadowed by the Christos or Messenger
of Life, and that his despairing cry from the cross “Eloi, Eloi,
Lama Sabachthani,” was wrung from him at the instant when he felt that
this inspiring Presence had finally abandoned him, for—as some affirmed—his
faith <em>had</em> also abandoned him when on the cross.</p>

<p>The early Nazarenes, who must be numbered among the Gnostic sects,
believing that Jesus was a prophet, held, nevertheless, in relation to him
the same doctrine of the divine “overshadowing,” of certain “men of
God,” sent for the salvation of nations, and to recall them to the path of
righteousness. “The Divine mind is eternal,” says the <cite>Codex</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_260" id="FNanchor_260">[260]</a> “And it is
pure light, and poured out through splendid <em>and immense space</em> (pleroma).
It is Genetrix of the Æons. But one of them went to matter (chaos)
stirring up confused (turbulentos) movements; and by a certain portion
of <em>heavenly</em> light fashioned it, properly constituted for use and appearance,
but the beginning of every evil. The Demiurg (of matter) claimed
divine
 <span class="lock">honor.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_261" id="FNanchor_261">[261]</a></span>
 Therefore Christus (“the anointed”), the prince of the
Æons (powers), was sent (expeditus), who <em>taking on the person</em> of a most
devout Jew, Iesu, <em>was to conquer him</em>; but who having <em>laid it</em> (the body)
<em>aside</em>, departed on high.” We will explain further on the full significance
of the name Christos and its mystic meaning.</p>

<p>And now, in order to make such passages as the above more intelligible,
we will endeavor to define, as briefly as possible, the dogmas in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
which, with very trifling differences, nearly all the Gnostic sects believed.
It is in Ephesus that flourished in those days the greatest college, wherein
the abstruse Oriental speculations and the Platonic philosophy were taught
in conjunction. It was a focus of the universal “secret” doctrines; the
weird laboratory whence, fashioned in elegant Grecian phraseology, sprang
the quintessence of Buddhistic, Zoroastrian, and Chaldean philosophy.
Artemis, the gigantic concrete symbol of theosophico-pantheistic abstractions,
the great mother Multimamma, androgyne and patroness of the
“Ephesian writings,” was conquered by Paul; but although the zealous
converts of the apostles pretended to burn all their books on “curious
arts,” τα περιεργα, enough of these remained for them to study when
their first zeal had cooled off. It is from Ephesus that spread nearly
all the <i>Gnosis</i> which antagonized so fiercely with the Irenæan dogmas;
and still it was Ephesus, with her numerous collateral branches of the
great college of the Essenes, which proved to be the hot-bed of all
the kabalistic speculations brought by the Tanaïm from the captivity.
“In Ephesus,” says Matter, “the notions of the Jewish-Egyptian school,
and the semi-Persian speculations of the kabalists had then recently come
to swell the vast conflux of Grecian and Asiatic doctrines, so there is no
wonder that teachers should have sprung up there who strove to combine
the religion newly preached by the apostle with the ideas there so
long established.”</p>

<p>Had not the Christians burdened themselves with the <em>Revelations</em>
of a little nation, and accepted the Jehovah of Moses, the Gnostic ideas
would never have been termed <i>heresies</i>; once relieved of their dogmatic
exaggerations the world would have had a religious system based on pure
Platonic philosophy, and surely something would then have been gained.</p>

<p>Now let us see what are the greatest <em>heresies</em> of the Gnostics. We
will select Basilides as the standard for our comparisons, for all the
founders of other Gnostic sects group round him, like a cluster of stars
borrowing light from their sun.</p>

<p>Basilides maintained that he had had all his doctrines from the Apostle
Matthew, and from Peter through Glaucus, the disciple of the latter.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_262" id="FNanchor_262">[262]</a>
According to
 <span class="lock">Eusebius,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_263" id="FNanchor_263">[263]</a></span>
 he published twenty-four volumes of
<cite>Interpretations upon the</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Gospels</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_264" id="FNanchor_264">[264]</a></span>
 all of which were burned, a fact which
makes us suppose that they contained more truthful matter than the
school of Irenæus was prepared to deny. He asserted that the unknown,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
eternal, and uncreated Father having first brought forth <i>Nous</i>, or Mind,
the latter emanated from itself—the <i>Logos</i>. The Logos (the Word of
John) emanated in its turn <i>Phronesis</i>, or the Intelligences (Divine-human
spirits). From Phronesis sprung <i>Sophia</i>, or feminine wisdom, and
<i>Dynamis</i>—strength. These were the personified attributes of the Mysterious
godhead, the Gnostic quinternion, typifying the five spiritual, but
intelligible substances, personal virtues or beings external to the
unknown godhead. This is preëminently a kabalistic idea. It is still
more Buddhistic. The earliest system of the Buddhistic philosophy—which
preceded by far Gautama-Buddha—is based upon the uncreated
substance of the “Unknown,” the A’di
 <span class="lock">Buddha.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_265" id="FNanchor_265">[265]</a></span>
 This eternal, infinite
Monad possesses, as proper to his own essence, five acts of wisdom.
From these it, by five separate acts of Dhyân, emitted five Dhyani
Buddhas; these, like A’di Buddha, are quiescent in their system (passive).
Neither A’di, nor either of the five Dhyani Buddhas, were ever
incarnated, but seven of their emanations became Avatars, <i>i.e.</i>, were
incarnated on this earth.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>Describing the Basilidean system, Irenæus, quoting the Gnostics,
declares as follows:</p>

<p>“When the uncreated, <em>unnamed</em> Father saw the corruption of mankind,
he sent his first-born <i>Nous</i>, into the world, in the form of Christ,
for the redemption of all who believe in him, out of the power of those
who fabricated the world (the Demiurgus, and his six sons, the planetary
genii). He appeared amongst men as the man, Jesus, and wrought
miracles. This Christ did <em>not die</em> in person, but Simon the Cyrenian
suffered in his stead, <em>to whom he lent his bodily form</em>; for the Divine
Power, the Nous of the Eternal Father, <em>is not corporeal</em>, and <em>cannot die</em>.
Whoso, therefore, maintains that Christ has died, is still the bondsman
of ignorance; whoso denies the same, he is free, and hath understood
the purpose of the <span class="lock">Father.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_266" id="FNanchor_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>So far, and taken in its abstract sense, we do not see anything blasphemous
in this system. It may be a <em>heresy</em> against the theology of
Irenæus and Tertullian,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_267" id="FNanchor_267">[267]</a>
 but there is certainly nothing sacrilegious
against the religious idea itself, and it will seem to every impartial thinker
far more consistent with divine reverence than the anthropomorphism
of actual Christianity. The Gnostics were called by the orthodox
Christians, <i>Docetæ</i>, or Illusionists, for believing that Christ did not, nor
could, suffer death actually—in physical body. The later Brahmanical
books contain, likewise, much that is repugnant to the reverential feeling
and idea of the Divinity; and as well as the Gnostics, the Brahmans
explain such legends as may shock the divine dignity of the Spiritual
beings called gods by attributing them to <i>Maya</i> or illusion.</p>

<p>A people brought up and nurtured for countless ages among all the
psychological phenomena of which the civilized (!) nations read, but
reject as incredible and worthless, cannot well expect to have its religious
system even understood—let alone appreciated. The profoundest
and most transcendental speculations of the ancient metaphysicians of
India and other countries, are all based on that great Buddhistic and
Brahmanical principle underlying the whole of their religious metaphysics—<em>illusion</em>
of the senses. Everything that is finite is illusion, all
that which is eternal and infinite is reality. Form, color, that which
we hear and feel, or see with our mortal eyes, exists only so far as it can
be conveyed to each of us through our senses. The universe for a man
born blind does not exist in either form or color, but it exists in its <em>privation</em>
(in the Aristotelean sense), and is a reality for the spiritual senses

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of the blind man. We all live under the powerful dominion of phantasy.
Alone the highest and invisible <em>originals</em> emanated from the
thought of the Unknown are real and permanent beings, forms, and
ideas; on earth, we see but their reflections; more or less correct, and
ever dependent on the physical and mental organization of the person
who beholds them.</p>

<p>Ages untold before our era, the Hindu Mystic Kapila, who is considered
by many scientists as a skeptic, because they judge him with their
habitual superficiality, magnificently expressed this idea in the following
terms:</p>

<p>“Man (physical man) counts for so little, that hardly anything can
demonstrate to him his proper existence and that of nature. Perhaps,
that which we regard as the universe, and the divers beings which seem
to compose it, have nothing real, and are but the product of continued
illusion—<i>maya</i>—of our senses.”</p>

<p>And the modern Schopenhauer, repeating this philosophical idea,
10,000 years old now, says: “Nature is non-existent, <i lang="la">per se</i>.... Nature
is the infinite illusion of our senses.” Kant, Schelling, and other metaphysicians
have said the same, and their school maintains the idea. The
objects of sense being ever delusive and fluctuating, cannot be a reality.
Spirit alone is unchangeable, hence—alone is no illusion. This is pure
Buddhist doctrine. The religion of the <i>Gnosis</i> (knowledge), the
most evident offshoot of Buddhism, was utterly based on this metaphysical
tenet. Christos suffered <em>spiritually</em> for us, and far more acutely
than did the illusionary Jesus while his body was being tortured on the
Cross.</p>

<p>In the ideas of the Christians, Christ is but another name for Jesus.
The philosophy of the Gnostics, the initiates, and hierophants understood
it otherwise. The word Christos, Χριστος, like all Greek words, must be
sought in its philological origin—the Sanscrit. In this latter language
<i>Kris</i> means
 <span class="lock">sacred,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_268" id="FNanchor_268">[268]</a></span>
 and the Hindu deity was named Chris-na (the
pure or the sacred) from that. On the other hand, the Greek <i>Christos</i>
bears several meanings, as anointed (pure oil, <i>chrism</i>) and others. In
all languages, though the synonym of the word means pure or sacred
essence, it is the first emanation of the invisible Godhead, manifesting
itself tangibly in spirit. The Greek Logos, the Hebrew Messiah, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Latin Verbum, and the Hindu Viradj (the son) are identically the same;
they represent an idea of collective entities—of flames detached from the
one eternal centre of light.</p>

<p>“The man who accomplishes pious but interested acts (with the sole
object of his salvation) may reach the ranks of the <i>devas</i>
 <span class="lock">(saints);<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_269" id="FNanchor_269">[269]</a></span>
 but he
who accomplishes, disinterestedly, the same pious acts, finds himself ridden
forever of the five elements” (of matter). “Perceiving the Supreme
Soul in all beings and all beings in the Supreme Soul, in offering his own
soul in sacrifice, he identifies himself with the Being who shines in his
own splendor” (<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr>, slokas 90, 91).</p>

<p>Thus, Christos, as a unity, is but an abstraction: a general idea
representing the collective aggregation of the numberless spirit-entities,
which are the direct emanations of the infinite, invisible, incomprehensible
<span class="smcap">First Cause</span>—the individual spirits of men, erroneously called the souls.
They are the divine sons of God, of which some only overshadow mortal
men—but this the majority—some remain forever planetary spirits,
and some—the smaller and rare minority—unite themselves during life
with some men. Such God-like beings as Gautama-Buddha, Jesus,
Tissoo, Christna, and a few others had united themselves with their
spirits permanently—hence, they became gods on earth. Others, such as
Moses, Pythagoras, Apollonius, Plotinus, Confucius, Plato, Iamblichus,
and some Christian saints, having at intervals been so united, have taken
rank in history as demi-gods and leaders of mankind. When unburthened of
their terrestrial tabernacles, their freed souls, henceforth united forever with
their spirits, rejoin the whole shining host, which is bound together in one
spiritual solidarity of thought and deed, and called “the anointed.” Hence,
the meaning of the Gnostics, who, by saying that “Christos” suffered
spiritually for humanity, implied that his Divine Spirit suffered mostly.</p>

<p>Such, and far more elevating were the ideas of Marcion, the great
“Heresiarch” of the second century, as he is termed by his opponents.
He came to Rome toward the latter part of the half-century, from
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 139-142, according to Tertullian, Irenæus, Clemens, and most of
his modern commentators, such as Bunsen, Tischendorf, Westcott, and
many others. Credner and
 <span class="lock">Schleiermacher<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_270" id="FNanchor_270">[270]</a></span>
 agree as to his high and
irreproachable personal character, his pure religious aspirations and
elevated views. His influence must have been powerful, as we find

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Epiphanius writing more than two centuries later that in his time the
followers of Marcion were to be found throughout the whole
 <span class="lock">world.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_271" id="FNanchor_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The danger must have been pressing and great indeed, if we are to
judge it to have been proportioned with the opprobrious epithets and vituperation
heaped upon Marcion by the “Great African,” that Patristic Cerberus,
whom we find ever barking at the door of the Irenæan dogmas.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_272" id="FNanchor_272">[272]</a>
We have but to open his celebrated refutation of Marcion’s <cite>Antitheses</cite>, to
acquaint ourselves with the <i lang="fr">fine-fleur</i> of monkish abuse of the Christian
school; an abuse so faithfully carried through the middle ages, to be
renewed again in our present day—at the Vatican. “Now, then, ye
hounds, yelping at the God of Truth, whom the apostles cast out, to all
your questions. These are the bones of contention which ye gnaw,”
etc.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_273" id="FNanchor_273">[273]</a> “The poverty of the Great African’s arguments keeps pace with
his abuse,” remarks the author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_274" id="FNanchor_274">[274]</a> “Their
(the Father’s) religious controversy bristles with misstatements, and is
turbid with pious abuse. Tertullian was a master of his style, and the
vehement vituperation with which he opens and often interlards his work
against ‘the impious and sacrilegious Marcion,’ offers anything but a
guarantee of fair and legitimate criticism.”</p>

<p>How firm these two Fathers—Tertullian and Epiphanius—were on
their theological ground, may be inferred from the curious fact that they intemperately
both vehemently reproach “the beast” (Marcion) “with erasing
passages from the <cite>Gospel of Luke</cite> which never were in <cite>Luke</cite> at all.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_275" id="FNanchor_275">[275]</a>
“The lightness and inaccuracy,” adds the critic, “with which Tertullian
proceeds, are all the better illustrated by the fact that not only does he
accuse Marcion falsely, but <em>he actually defines the motives</em> for which he expunged
a passage <em>which never existed</em>; in the same chapter he also similarly
accuses Marcion of erasing (from <cite>Luke</cite>) the saying that Christ had not
come to destroy the law and the prophets, but to fulfill them, and he
actually repeats the charge on two other
 <span class="lock">occasions.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_276" id="FNanchor_276">[276]</a></span>
 Epiphanius also
commits the mistake of reproaching Marcion with omitting from <cite>Luke</cite>
what is only found in <span class="lock"><cite>Matthew</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_277" id="FNanchor_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>Having so far shown the amount of reliance to be placed in the
Patristic literature, and it being unanimously conceded by the great majority
of biblical critics that what the Fathers fought for was not <em>truth</em>,
but their own interpretations and unwarranted
 <span class="lock">assertions,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_278" id="FNanchor_278">[278]</a></span>
 we will now

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
proceed to state what were the views of Marcion, whom Tertullian desired
to annihilate as the most dangerous <em>heretic</em> of his day. If we are to believe
Hilgenfeld, one of the greatest German biblical critics, then “From
the critical standing-point one must ... consider the statements of the
Fathers of the Church only as expressions of their <em>subjective view</em>, which
itself requires <span class="lock">proof.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_279" id="FNanchor_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>We can do no better nor make a more correct statement of facts
concerning Marcion than by quoting what our space permits from <cite>Supernatural
Religion</cite>, the author of which bases his assertions on the evidence
of the greatest critics, as well as on his own researches. He shows in
the days of Marcion “two broad parties in the primitive Church”—one
considering Christianity “a mere continuation of the law, and dwarfing
it into an Israelitish institution, a narrow sect of Judaism;” the other
representing the glad tidings “as the introduction of a new system, applicable
to all, and supplanting the Mosaic dispensation of the law by a
universal dispensation of grace.” These two parties, he adds, “were
popularly represented in the early Church, by the two apostles Peter and
Paul, and their antagonism is faintly revealed in the <cite>Epistle to the
Galatians</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_280" id="FNanchor_280">[280]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Marcion, who recognized no other <cite>Gospels</cite> than a few <cite>Epistles of
Paul</cite>, who rejected totally the anthropomorphism of the <cite>Old Testament</cite>,
and drew a distinct line of demarcation between the old Judaism
and Christianity, viewed Jesus neither as a King, Messiah of the Jews,
nor the son of David, who was in any way connected with the law or
prophets, “but a divine being sent to reveal to man a spiritual religion,
wholly new, and a God of goodness and grace hitherto unknown.” The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
“Lord God” of the Jews in his eyes, the Creator (Demiurgos), was totally
different and distinct from the Deity who sent Jesus to reveal the divine
truth and preach the glad tidings, to bring reconciliation and salvation to
all. The mission of Jesus—according to Marcion—was to abrogate the
Jewish “Lord,” who “was opposed to the God and Father of Jesus
Christ as <em>matter is to spirit, impurity to purity</em>.”</p>

<p>Was Marcion so far wrong? Was it blasphemy, or was it intuition,
divine inspiration in him to express that which every honest heart yearning
for truth, more or less feels and acknowledges? If in his sincere
desire to establish a purely spiritual religion, a universal faith based on
unadulterated truth, he found it necessary to make of Christianity an
entirely new and separate system from that of Judaism, did not Marcion
have the very words of Christ for his authority? “No man putteth a piece
of new cloth into an old garment ... for the rent is made worse....
Neither do men put new wine into old bottles, else the bottles break,
and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish; but <em>they put new wine
into new bottles</em>, and both are preserved.” In what particular does the
jealous, wrathful, revengeful God of Israel resemble the unknown deity,
the God of mercy preached by Jesus;—<em>his</em> Father who is in Heaven,
and the Father of all humanity? This Father alone is the God of spirit
and purity, and, to compare Him with the subordinate and capricious
Sinaitic Deity is an error. Did Jesus ever pronounce the name of
Jehovah? Did he ever place <em>his</em> Father in contrast with this severe and
cruel Judge; his God of mercy, love, and justice, with the Jewish genius
of retaliation? Never! From that memorable day when he preached
his Sermon on the Mount, an immeasurable void opened between his
God and that other deity who fulminated his commands from that other
mount—Sinai. The language of Jesus is unequivocal; it implies not only
rebellion but defiance of the Mosaic “Lord God.” “Ye have heard,”
he tells us, “that it hath been said, an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth: but <em>I say</em> unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall
smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. Ye have
heard that it hath been said [by the same “Lord God” on Sinai]:
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy. But <em>I say</em> unto
you; Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them
that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute
you” (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="five">v.</abbr>).</p>

<p>And now, open <cite>Manu</cite> and read:</p>

<p>“Resignation, <em>the action of rendering good for evil</em>, temperance, probity,
purity, repression of the senses, the knowledge of the <i>Sastras</i> (the
holy books), that of the supreme soul, truthfulness and abstinence from
anger, such are the ten virtues in which consists duty.... Those who

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
study these ten precepts of duty, and after having studied them conform
their lives thereto, will reach to the supreme condition” (<cite>Manu</cite>, book
<abbr title="six">vi.</abbr>, sloka 92).</p>

<p>If <cite>Manu</cite> did not trace these words many thousands of years before
the era of Christianity, at least no voice in the whole world will dare deny
them a less antiquity than several centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The same in the case
of the precepts of Buddhism.</p>

<p>If we turn to the <cite>Prâtimoksha Sûtra</cite> and other religious tracts of the
Buddhists, we read the ten following commandments:</p>


<ul><li> 1. Thou shalt not kill any living creature.</li>
<li> 2. Thou shalt not steal.</li>
<li> 3. Thou shalt not break thy vow of chastity.</li>
<li> 4. Thou shalt not lie.</li>
<li> 5. Thou shalt not betray the secrets of others.</li>
<li> 6. Thou shalt not wish for the death of thy enemies.</li>
<li> 7. Thou shalt not desire the wealth of others.</li>
<li> 8. Thou shalt not pronounce injurious and foul words.</li>
<li> 9. Thou shalt not indulge in luxury (sleep on soft beds or be lazy).</li>
<li>10. Thou shalt not accept gold or silver.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_281" id="FNanchor_281">[281]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>“Good master, what shall I do that I may have eternal life?” asks a
man of Jesus. “Keep the commandments.” “Which?” “Thou shalt
do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,
Thou shalt not bear false
 <span class="lock">witness,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_282" id="FNanchor_282">[282]</a></span>
 is the answer.</p>

<p>“What shall I do to obtain possession of Bhodi? (knowledge of
eternal truth)” asks a disciple of his Buddhist master. “What way is
there to become an Upasaka?” “Keep the commandments.” “What
are they?” “Thou shalt abstain all thy life from murder, theft, adultery,
and lying,” answers the <span class="lock">master.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_283" id="FNanchor_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Identical injunctions are they not? Divine injunctions, the living
up to which would purify and exalt humanity. But are they more divine
when uttered through one mouth than another? If it is god-like to return
good for evil, does the enunciation of the precept by a Nazarene give it
any greater force than its enunciation by an Indian, or Thibetan philosopher?
We see that the Golden Rule was not original with Jesus; that
its birth-place was India. Do what we may, we cannot deny Sakya-Muni
Buddha a less remote antiquity than several centuries before the
birth of Jesus. In seeking a model for his system of ethics why should
Jesus have gone to the foot of the Himalayas rather than to the foot of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Sinai, but that the doctrines of Manu and Gautama harmonized exactly
with his own philosophy, while those of Jehovah were to him abhorrent and
terrifying? The Hindus taught to return <em>good for evil</em>, but the Jehovistic
command was: “An eye for an eye” and “a tooth for a tooth.”</p>

<p>Would Christians still maintain the identity of the “Father” of Jesus
and Jehovah, if evidence sufficiently clear could be adduced that the
“Lord God” was no other than the Pagan Bacchus, Dionysos? Well,
this identity of the Jehovah at Mount Sinai with the god Bacchus is hardly
disputable. The name יהוה is Yava or Iao, according to Theodoret,
which is the <em>secret</em> name of the Phœnician
 <span class="lock">Mystery-god;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_284" id="FNanchor_284">[284]</a></span>
 and it was actually
adopted from the Chaldeans with whom it also was the secret name
of the creator. Wherever Bacchus was worshipped there was a tradition
of Nysa and a cave where he was reared. Beth-San or Scythopolis in
Palestine had that designation; so had a spot on Mount Parnassus.
But Diodorus declares that Nysa was between Phœnicia and Egypt;
Euripides states that Dionysos came to Greece from India; and Diodorus
adds his testimony: “Osiris was brought up in Nysa, in Arabia the
Happy; he was the son of Zeus, and was named from his father (nominative
Zeus, genitive <i>Dios</i>) and the place Dio-Nysos”—the Zeus or Jove
of Nysa. This identity of name or title is very significant. In Greece
Dionysos was second only to Zeus, and Pindar says:</p>

<p class="center small">
“So Father Zeus governs all things, and Bacchus he governs also.”<br>
</p>

<p>But outside of Greece Bacchus was the all-powerful “Zagreus, the
highest of gods.” Moses seems to have worshipped him personally and
together with the populace at Mount Sinai; unless we admit that he
was an <em>initiated</em> priest, an adept, who knew how to lift the veil which
hangs behind all such exoteric worship, but kept the secret. “<cite>And Moses
built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah</cite>-<span class="smcap">Nissi</span>!” or <i>Iao-Nisi</i>.
What better evidence is required to show that the Sinaitic god was indifferently
Bacchus, Osiris, and Jehovah? Mr. Sharpe appends also his
testimony that the place where Osiris was born “was Mount Sinai,
called by the Egyptians Mount Nissa.” The Brazen Serpent was a
<i>nis</i>, נחש, and the month of the Jewish Passover <i>nisan</i>.</p>

<p>If the Mosaic “Lord God” was the only living God, and Jesus His
only Son, how account for the rebellious language of the latter? Without
hesitation or qualification he sweeps away the Jewish <i lang="la">lex talionis</i>
and substitutes for it the law of charity and self-denial. If the <cite>Old Testament</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
is a divine revelation, how can the <cite>New Testament</cite> be? Are we
required to believe and worship a Deity who contradicts himself every
few hundred years? Was Moses inspired, or was Jesus <em>not</em> the son of
God? This is a dilemma from which the theologians are bound to rescue
us. It is from this very dilemma that the Gnostics endeavored to
snatch the budding Christianity.</p>

<p>Justice has been waiting nineteen centuries for intelligent commentators
to appreciate this difference between the orthodox Tertullian and
the Gnostic Marcion. The brutal violence, unfairness, and bigotry of the
“great African” repulse all who accept his Christianity. “How can a
god,” inquired Marcion, “break his own commandments? How could
he consistently prohibit idolatry and image-worship, and still cause Moses
to set up the brazen serpent? How command: Thou shalt not steal,
and then order the Israelites to <em>spoil</em> the Egyptians of their gold and
silver?” Anticipating the results of modern criticism, Marcion denies
the applicability to Jesus of the so-called Messianic prophecies. Writes
the author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite>:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_285" id="FNanchor_285">[285]</a> “The Emmanuel of Isaiah is not
Christ; the ‘Virgin,’ his mother, is simply a ‘young woman,’ an alma
of the temple; and the sufferings of the servant of God (<cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="fifty-two">lii.</abbr>
13-<abbr title="fifty-three">liii.</abbr> 3) are not predictions of the death of
 <span class="lock">Jesus.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_286" id="FNanchor_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is alleged that the
 <cite>Pentateuch</cite> was written by Moses, and yet it
contains the account of his own death (<cite>Deuteronomy</cite>
 <abbr title="thirty-four">xxxiv.</abbr> 6);
and in <cite>Genesis</cite> (<abbr title="fourteen">xiv.</abbr> 14), the name Dan is given to a city, which
 <cite>Judges</cite>
(<abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 29), tells us was only called by that name at that late day, it having
previously been known as Laish. Well might Josiah have rent his
clothes when he had heard the words of the Book of the Law; for there
was no more of Moses in it than there is of Jesus in the <cite>Gospel according
to John</cite>.</p>

<p>We have one fair alternative to offer our theologians, leaving them to
choose for themselves, and promising to abide by their decision. Only
they will have to admit, either that Moses was an impostor, or that his
books are forgeries, written at different times and by different persons;
or, again, that they are full of fraudulent interpolations. In either case
the work loses all claims to be considered divine <em>Revelation</em>. Here is
the problem, which we quote from the <cite>Bible</cite>—the word of the God of
Truth:</p>

<p>“And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the
name of God Almighty, but by my name of <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> was I not known to
them” (<cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 3), spake God unto Moses.</p>

<p>A very startling bit of information that, when, before arriving at the
book of <cite>Exodus</cite>, we are told in <cite>Genesis</cite> (<abbr title="twenty-two">xxii.</abbr> 14) that “Abraham
called the name of that place”—where the patriarch had been preparing
to cut the throat of his only-begotten son—“<span class="allsmcap">JEHOVAH</span>-jireh!” (Jehovah
sees.) Which is the inspired text?—both cannot be—which the
forgery?</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Now, if both Abraham and Moses had not belonged to the same holy
group, we might, perhaps, help theologians by suggesting to them a convenient
means of escape out of this dilemma. They ought to call the
reverend Jesuit Fathers—especially those who have been missionaries in
India—to their rescue. The latter would not be for a moment disconcerted.
They would coolly tell us that beyond doubt Abraham had heard
the name of Jehovah and <em>borrowed</em> it from Moses. Do they not maintain
that it was they who invented the <i>Sanscrit</i>, edited <cite>Manu</cite>, and composed
the greater portion of the <cite>Vedas?</cite></p>

<p>Marcion maintained, with the other Gnostics, the fallaciousness of the
idea of an incarnate God, and therefore denied the corporeal reality of
the living body of Christ. His entity was a mere <em>illusion</em>; it was not
made of human flesh and blood, neither was it born of a human mother,
for his divine nature could not be polluted with any contact with sinful
 <span class="lock">flesh.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_287" id="FNanchor_287">[287]</a></span>
 He accepted Paul as the only apostle preaching the pure gospel
of truth, and accused the other disciples of “depraving the pure
form of the gospel doctrines delivered to them by Jesus, mixing up matters
of the Law with the words of the <span class="lock">Saviour.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_288" id="FNanchor_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally we may add that modern biblical criticism, which unfortunately
became really active and serious only toward the end of the last
century, now generally admits that Marcion’s text of the only gospel he
knew anything about—that of Luke, is far superior and by far more correct
than that of our present Synoptics. We find in <cite>Supernatural
Religion</cite> the following (for every Christian) startling sentence: “We
are, therefore, <em>indebted to Marcion for the correct version even of ‘the
Lords Prayer</em>.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_289" id="FNanchor_289">[289]</a></p>

<p>If, leaving for the present the prominent founders of Christian sects,
we now turn to that of the Ophites, which assumed a definite form about
the time of Marcion and the Basilideans, we may find in it the reason
for the <em>heresies</em> of all others. Like all other Gnostics, they rejected the
Mosaic <cite>Bible</cite> entirely. Nevertheless, their philosophy, apart from some
deductions original with several of the most important founders of the
various branches of Gnosticism was not new. Passing through the Chaldean
kabalistic tradition, it gathered its materials in the Hermetic books,
and pursuing its flight still farther back for its metaphysical speculations,
we find it floundering among the tenets of Manu, and the earliest Hindu
ante-sacerdotal genesis. Many of our eminent antiquarians trace the
Gnostic philosophies right back to Buddhism, which does not impair in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the least either their or our arguments. We repeat again, <em>Buddhism is
but the primitive source of Brahmanism</em>. It is not against the primitive
<cite>Vedas</cite> that Gautama protests. It is against the sacerdotal and official
state religion of his country; and the Brahmans, who in order to make
room for and give authority to the castes, at a later period crammed the
ancient manuscripts with interpolated slokas, intended to prove that the
castes were predetermined by the Creator by the very fact that each class
of men was issued from a more or less noble limb of Brahma. Gautama-Buddha’s
philosophy was that taught from the beginning of time in the
impenetrable secresy of the inner sanctuaries of the pagodas. We need
not be surprised, therefore, to find again, in all the fundamental dogmas
of the Gnostics, the metaphysical tenets of both Brahmanism and
Buddhism. They held that the <cite>Old Testament</cite> was the revelation of an
inferior being, a subordinate divinity, and did not contain a single sentence
of their <i>Sophia</i>, the Divine Wisdom. As to the <cite>New Testament</cite>, it
had lost its purity when the compilers became guilty of interpolations.
The revelation of divine truth was sacrificed by them to promote selfish
ends and maintain quarrels. The accusation does not seem so very
improbable to one who is well aware of the constant strife between the
champions of circumcision and the “Law,” and the apostles who had
given up Judaism.</p>

<p>The Gnostic Ophites taught the doctrine of Emanations, so hateful to
the defenders of the unity in the trinity, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. The Unknown
Deity with them had <em>no name</em>; but his first female emanation was called
Bythos or
 <span class="lock">Depth.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_290" id="FNanchor_290">[290]</a></span>
 It answered to the Shekinah of the kabalists, the
“Veil” which conceals the “Wisdom” in the <em>cranium</em> of the highest
of the <em>three</em> heads. As the Pythagorean Monad, this <em>nameless</em> Wisdom
was the <em>Source</em> of Light, and <i>Ennoia</i> or Mind, is Light itself. The
latter was also called the “Primitive Man,” like the Adam Kadmon, or
ancient Adam of the <cite>Kabala</cite>. Indeed, if man was created after his
likeness and in the image of God, then this God was like his creature in
shape and figure—hence, he is the “Primitive man.” The first Manu,
the one evolved from Swayambhuva, “he who exists unrevealed in his
own glory,” is also, in one sense, the primitive man, with the Hindus.</p>

<p>Thus the “nameless and the unrevealed,” Bythos, his female reflection,
and Ennoia, the revealed Mind proceeding from both, or their Son
are the counterparts of the Chaldean first triad as well as those of the
Brahmanic Trimurti. We will compare: in all the three systems we see</p>

<p>To place it still clearer, the Babylonian System recognizes first—the
<span class="smcap">One</span> (Ad, or Ad-ad), who is never named, but only acknowledged in
thought as the Hindu Swayambhuva. From this he becomes manifest as
Anu or Ana—the one above all—Monas. Next comes the Demiurge
called Bel or Elu, who is the active power of the Godhead. The third is
the principle of Wisdom, Hea or Hoa, who also rules the sea and the
underworld. Each of these has his divine consort, giving us Anata, Belta,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>

and Davkina. These, however, are only like the <i>Saktis</i>, and not especially
remarked by theologists. But the female principle is denoted by Mylitta,
the Great Mother, called also Ishtar. So with the three male gods, we
have the Triad or Trimurti, and with Mylitta added, the <i>Arba</i> or Four
(Tetraktys of Pythagoras), which perfects and potentializes all. Hence,
the above-given modes of expression. The following Chaldean diagram

<p>Hence, Hebron, the city of the Kabeiri was called Kirjath-Arba, city
of the Four. The Kabeiri were Axieros—the noble Eros, Axiokersos,
the worthy horned one, Axiokersa, Demeter and Kadmiel, Hoa, etc.</p>

<p>The Pythagorean ten denoted the Arba-Il or Divine Four, emblematized
by the Hindu Lingham: Anu, 1; Bel, 2; Hoa, 3, which makes 6.
The triad and Mylitta as 4 make the ten.</p>

<p>Though he is termed the “Primitive Man,” Ennoia, who is like the
Egyptian Pimander, the “Power of the Thought Divine,” the first intelligible
manifestation of the Divine Spirit in material form, he is like the
“Only-Begotten” Son of the “Unknown Father,” of all other nations.
He is the emblem of the first appearance of the divine Presence in his
own works of creation, tangible and visible, and therefore comprehensible.
The mystery-God, or the ever-unrevealed Deity fecundates through
His will Bythos, the unfathomable and infinite depth that exists in
silence (Sigè) and darkness (for our intellect), and that represents the
abstract idea of all nature, the ever-producing Cosmos. As neither the
male nor female principle, blended into the idea of a double-sexed Deity
in ancient conceptions, could be comprehended by an ordinary human
intellect, the theology of every people had to create for its religion a
Logos, or manifested word, in some shape or other. With the Ophites
and other Gnostics who took their models direct from more ancient
originals, the unrevealed Bythos and her male counterpart produce
Ennoia, and the three in their turn produce
 <span class="lock">Sophia,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_291" id="FNanchor_291">[291]</a></span>
 thus completing the
Tetraktys, which will emanate Christos, the very essence of the Father

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
Spirit. As the unrevealed One, or concealed Logos in its latent state,
he has existed from all eternity in the Arba-Il, the metaphysical abstraction;
therefore, he is <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> with all others as a unity, the latter (including
all) being indifferently termed Ennoia, Sigè (silence), Bythos, etc. As
the revealed one, he is Androgyne, Christos, and Sophia (Divine Wisdom),
who descend into the man Jesus. Both Father and Son are shown
by Irenæus to have loved the beauty (<i>formam</i>) of the primitive woman,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_292" id="FNanchor_292">[292]</a>
who is Bythos—Depth—as well as Sophia, and as having produced conjointly
Ophis and Sophia (double-sexed unity again), male and female
wisdom, one being considered as the unrevealed Holy Spirit, or elder
Sophia—the <i>Pneuma</i>—the intellectual “Mother of all things;” the other
the revealed one, or <i>Ophis</i>, typifying divine wisdom fallen into matter,
or God-man—Jesus, whom the Gnostic Ophites represented by the
serpent (Ophis).</p>

<p>Fecundated by the Divine Light of the Father and Son, the highest
spirit and Ennoia, Sophia produces in her turn two other emanations—one
perfect Christos, the second imperfect Sophia-Achamoth,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_293" id="FNanchor_293">[293]</a>
from חכמות <a id="hebrew1"></a>hakhamoth (simple wisdom), who becomes the mediatrix between
the intellectual and material worlds.</p>

<p>Christos was the mediator and guide between God (the Higher), and
everything spiritual in man; Achamoth—the younger Sophia—held the
same duty between the “Primitive man,” Ennoia and matter. What
was mysteriously meant by the general term, <i>Christos</i>, we have just
explained.</p>

<p>Delivering a sermon on the “Month of Mary,” we find the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr.
Preston, of New York City, expressing the Christian idea of the female
principle of the trinity better and more clearly than we could, and substantially
in the spirit of an ancient “heathen” philosopher. He says
that the “plan of the redemption made it necessary that a mother should
be found, and Mary stands pre-eminently alone as the only instance when
a creature was necessary to the consummation of God’s work.” We will
beg the right to contradict the reverend gentleman. As shown above, thousands
of years before our era it was found necessary by all the “heathen”
theogonies to find a female principle, a “mother” for the triune male
principle. Hence, Christianity does not present the “only instance” of
such a consummation of God’s work—albeit, as this work shows, there
was more philosophy and less materialism, or rather anthropomorphism,
in it. But hear the reverend Doctor express “heathen” thought in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Christian ideas. “He” (God), he says, “prepared her (Mary’s) virginal
and celestial purity, for a mother defiled could not become the mother of
the Most High. The holy virgin, even in her childhood, was more pleasing
than all the Cherubim and Seraphim, and from infancy to the maturing
maidenhood and womanhood she grew more and more pure. By her very
sanctity she reigned over the heart of God. <em>When the hour came, the
whole court of heaven was hushed, and the trinity listened for the answer
of Mary, for without her consent the world could not have been redeemed.</em>”</p>

<p>Does it not seem as if we were reading Irenæus explaining the Gnostic
“<em>Heresy</em>, which taught that the Father and Son loved the beauty (<i>formam</i>)
of the celestial Virgin?” or the Egyptian system, of Isis being both
wife, sister, and mother of Osiris—Horus? With the Gnostic philosophy
there were but <em>two</em>, but the Christians have improved and perfected the
system by making it completely “heathen,” for it is the Chaldean Anu—Bel—Hoa,
merging into Mylitta. “Then while this month (of Mary),”
adds Dr. Preston, “begins in the paschal season—the month when nature
decks herself with fruits and flowers, the harbingers of a bright harvest—let
us, too, begin for a golden harvest. In this month the dead comes
up out of the earth, figuring the resurrection; so, when we are kneeling
before the altar of the holy and immaculate Mary, let us remember that
there should come forth from us the bud of promise, the flower of hope,
and the imperishable fruit of sanctity.”</p>

<p>This is precisely the substratum of the Pagan thought, which, among
other meanings, emblematized by the rites of the resurrection of Osiris,
Adonis, Bacchus, and other slaughtered sun-gods, the resurrection of all
nature in spring, the germination of seeds that had been dead and sleeping
during winter, and so were allegorically said to be kept in the underworld
(Hades). They are typified by the three days passed in hell before
his resurrection by Hercules, by Christ, and others.</p>

<p>This derivation, or rather <em>heresy</em>, as it is called in Christianity, is
simply the Brahmanic doctrine in all its archaic purity. Vishnu, the
second personage of the Hindu trinity, is also the Logos, for he is made
subsequently to incarnate himself in Christna. And Lakmy (or Lakshmy)
who, as in the case of Osiris, and Isis, of En-Soph and Sephira, and of
Bythos and Ennoia, is both his wife, sister, and daughter, through this
endless correlation of male and female creative powers in the abstruse
metaphysics of the ancient philosophies—is Sophia-Achamoth. Christna
is the mediator promised by Brahma to mankind, and represents the same
idea as the Gnostic Christos. And Lakmy, Vishnu’s spiritual half, is the
emblem of physical nature, the universal mother of all the material and
revealed forms; the mediatrix and protector of nature, like Sophia-Achamoth,
who is made by the Gnostics the mediatrix between the Great

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Cause and Matter, as Christos is the mediator between him and spiritual
humanity.</p>

<p>This Brahmano-Gnostic tenet is more logical, and more consistent
with the allegory of <cite>Genesis</cite> and the fall of man. When God curses the
first couple, He is made to curse also the earth and everything that is on
it. The <cite>New Testament</cite> gives us a Redeemer for the first sin of mankind,
which was punished for having sinned; but there is not a word said about
a Saviour who would take off the unmerited curse from the earth and
the animals, which had never sinned at all. Thus the Gnostic allegory
shows a greater sense of both justice and logic than the Christian.</p>

<p>In the Ophite system, Sophia, the Androgyne Wisdom, is also the
female spirit, or the Hindu female Nari (Narayana), moving on the face
of the waters—chaos, or future matter. She vivifies it from afar, but not
touching the abyss of darkness. She is unable to do so, for Wisdom is
purely intellectual, and cannot act directly on matter. Therefore, Sophia
is obliged to address herself to her Supreme Parent; but although life
proceeds primally from the Unseen Cause, and his Ennoia, neither of them
can, any more than herself, have anything to do with the lower chaos in
which matter assumes its definite shape. Thus, Sophia is obliged to
employ on the task her <em>imperfect</em> emanation, Sophia-Achamoth, the latter
being of a mixed nature, half spiritual and half material.</p>

<p>The only difference between the Ophite cosmogony and that of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John Nazarenes is a change of names. We find equally an identical system
in the <cite>Kabala</cite>, the <cite>Book of Mystery</cite> (<cite lang="la">Liber</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Mysterii</cite>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_294" id="FNanchor_294">[294]</a></span>
 All the three systems,
especially that of the kabalists and the Nazarenes, which were the
<i>models</i> for the Ophite Cosmogony, belong to the pure Oriental Gnosticism.
The <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite> opens with: “The Supreme King of Light, Mano,
the great first
 <span class="lock">one,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_295" id="FNanchor_295">[295]</a></span>
 etc., the latter being the emanation of Ferho—the
unknown, formless <span class="smcap">Life</span>. He is the chief of the Æons, from whom proceed
(or shoot forth) five refulgent rays of Divine light. Mano is <i lang="la">Rex
Lucis</i>, the Bythos-Ennoia of the Ophites. “<i lang="la">Unus est Rex Lucis in suo
regno, nec ullus qui eo altior, nullus qui ejus similitudinem retulerit, nullus
qui sublatis oculis, viderit Coronam quæ in ejus capite est.</i>” He is the Manifested
Light around the highest of the three kabalistic heads, the concealed
wisdom; from him emanate the three <em>Lives</em>. Æbel Zivo is the revealed
Logos, Christos the “Apostle Gabriel,” and the first Legate or messenger
of light. If Bythos and Ennoia are the Nazarene Mano, then the dual-natured,
the semi-spiritual, semi-material Achamoth must be Fetahil when
viewed from her spiritual aspect; and if regarded in her grosser nature,
she is the Nazarene “Spiritus.”</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Fetahil,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_296" id="FNanchor_296">[296]</a>
 who is the reflection of his father, Lord Abatur, the <em>third</em>
life—as the elder Sophia is also the third emanation—is the “newest-man.”
Perceiving his fruitless attempts to create a perfect material
world, the “Spiritus” calls to one of her progeny, the Karabtanos—Ilda-Baoth—who
is without sense or judgment (“blind matter”), to unite himself
with her to create something definite out of this confused (<i lang="la">turbulentos</i>)
matter, which task she is enabled to achieve only after having
produced from this union with Karabtanos the seven stellars. Like the
six sons or genii of the Gnostic Ilda-Baoth, they then frame the material
world. The same story is repeated over again in Sophia-Achamoth.
Delegated by her purely spiritual parent, the elder Sophia, to create the
world of <em>visible forms</em>, she descended into chaos, and, overpowered by
the emanation of matter, lost her way. Still ambitious to create a world
of matter of her own, she busied herself hovering to and fro about the
dark abyss, and imparted life and motion to the inert elements, until she
became so hopelessly entangled in matter that, like Fetahil, she is represented
sitting immersed in mud, and unable to extricate herself from it;
until, by the contact of matter itself, she produces the <em>Creator</em> of the
material world. He is the Demiurgus, called by the Ophites Ilda-Baoth,
and, as we will directly show, the parent of the Jewish God in the opinion
of some sects, and held by others to be the “Lord God” Himself. It is
at this point of the kabalistic-gnostic cosmogony that begins the Mosaic
<cite>Bible</cite>. Having accepted the Jewish <cite>Old Testament</cite>
 as their standard, no
wonder that the Christians were forced by the exceptional position in
which they were placed through their own ignorance, to make the best
of it.</p>

<p>The first groups of Christians, whom Renan shows numbering but
from seven to twelve men in <em>each church</em>, belonged unquestionably to
the poorest and most ignorant classes. They had and could have no
idea of the highly philosophical doctrines of the Platonists and Gnostics,
and evidently knew as little about their own newly-made-up religion.
To these, who if Jews, had been crushed under the tyrannical dominion
of the “law,” as enforced by the elders of the synagogues, and if Pagans
had been always excluded, as the lower castes are until now in India,
from the religious mysteries, the God of the Jews and the “Father”
preached by Jesus were all one. The contention which reigned from the
first years following the death of Jesus, between the two parties, the Pauline
and the Petrine—were deplorable. What one did, the other deemed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
a sacred duty to undo. If the <cite>Homilies</cite> are considered apocryphal, and
cannot very well be accepted as an infallible standard by which to measure
the animosity which raged between the two apostles, we have the
<cite>Bible</cite>, and the proofs afforded therein are plentiful.</p>

<p>So hopelessly entangled seems Irenæus in his fruitless endeavors to
describe, to all outward appearance at least, the true doctrines of the
many Gnostic sects of which he treats and to present them at the same
time as abominable “heresies,” that he either deliberately, or through
ignorance, confounds all of them in such a way that few metaphysicians
would be able to disentangle them, without the <cite>Kabala</cite> and the <cite>Codex</cite>
as the true keys. Thus, for instance, he cannot even tell the difference
between the Sethianites and the Ophites, and tells us that they called the
“God of all,” “<i>Hominem</i>,” a <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>, and his mind the <span class="allsmcap">SECOND</span> man, or the
“<i>Son of man</i>.” So does Theodoret, who lived more than two centuries
after Irenæus, and who makes a sad mess of the chronological order in
which the various sects succeeded each
 <span class="lock">other.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_297" id="FNanchor_297">[297]</a></span>
 Neither the Sethianites,
(a branch of the Jewish Nazarenes) nor the Ophites, a purely Greek sect,
have ever held anything of the kind. Irenæus contradicts his own
words by describing in another place the doctrines of Cerinthus, the
direct disciple of Simon Magus. He says that Cerinthus taught that the
world was not created by the <span class="allsmcap">FIRST</span> GOD, but by a virtue (virtus) or
power, an Æon so distant from the First Cause that he was even ignorant
of <span class="allsmcap">HIM</span> who <em>is above all things</em>. This Æon subjected Jesus, he begot him
physically through Joseph from one who was not a virgin, but simply the
wife of that Joseph, and Jesus was born like all other men. Viewed
from this physical aspect of his nature, Jesus was called the “son of man.”
It is only after his <em>baptism</em>, that <i>Christos</i>, the anointed, descended from
the Princeliness of above, in the figure of a dove, and then announced the
<span class="allsmcap">UNKNOWN</span> Father through <span class="lock">Jesus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_298" id="FNanchor_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>If, therefore, Jesus was physically considered as a son of man, and
spiritually as the Christos, who overshadowed him, how then could the
“<span class="allsmcap">GOD OF ALL</span>,” the “<em>Unknown</em> Father,”
 be called by the Gnostics <i lang="la">Homo</i>,
a <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>, and his Mind, Ennoia, the
 <span class="allsmcap">SECOND</span> man, or <i>Son of man</i>?
Neither in the Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>, nor in Gnosticism, was the “God of all”
ever anthropomorphized. It is but the first, or rather the second emanations,
for Shekinah, Sephira, Depth, and other first-manifested female
virtues are also emanations, that are termed “primitive men.” Thus
Adam Kadmon, Ennoia (or Sigè), the <i>logoi</i> in short, are the “only-begotten”
ones but not the <em>Sons</em> of man, which appellation properly belongs

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to Christos the son of Sophia (the elder) and of the primitive man
who produces him through his own vivifying light, which emanates from
the source or <em>cause</em> of all, hence the <em>cause</em> of his light also, the “Unknown
Father.” There is a great difference made in the Gnostic metaphysics
between the first unrevealed Logos and the “anointed,” who is
Christos. Ennoia may be termed, as Philo understands it, the <em>Second</em>
God, but he alone is the “Primitive and First man,” and by no means
the Second one, as Theodoret and Irenæus have it. It is but the inveterate
desire of the latter to connect Jesus in every possible way, even in the
<cite>Hæresies</cite>, with the <em>Highest</em> God, that led him into so many falsifications.</p>

<p>Such an identification with the <em>Unknown</em> God, even of Christos, the
anointed—the Æon who overshadowed him—let alone of the man Jesus,
never entered the head of the Gnostics nor even of the direct apostles
and of Paul, whatever later forgeries may have added.</p>

<p>How daring and desperate were many such deliberate falsifications
was shown in the first attempts to compare the original manuscripts with
later ones. In Bishop Horseley’s edition of Sir Isaac Newton’s works,
several manuscripts on theological subjects were cautiously withheld
from publication. The article known as <cite>Christ’s Descent into Hell</cite>, which
is found in the later Apostles’ Creed, is not to be found in the manuscripts
of either the fourth or sixth centuries. It was an evident interpolation
copied from the fables of Bacchus and Hercules and enforced
upon Christendom as an article of faith. Concerning it the author of the
preface to the <cite>Catalogue of the Manuscripts of the King’s Library</cite> (preface,
<abbr title="page twenty-one">p. xxi.</abbr>) remarks: “I wish that the insertion
 of the article of <cite>Christ’s
Descent into Hell</cite> into the Apostles’ Creed could be as well accounted
for as the <em>insertion</em> of the <em>said</em> verse” (<cite>First Epistle of John</cite>,
<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> <span class="lock">7).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_299" id="FNanchor_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this verse reads: “For there are three that bear record in
Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost; and these three are
one.” This verse, which has been “appointed to be read in churches,”
is now known to be spurious. It is not to be found in any Greek manuscript,
save one at Berlin, which was transcribed from some interpolated
paraphrase between the lines. In the first and second editions of Erasmus,
printed in 1516 and 1519, this allusion to these three heavenly witnesses
is <em>omitted</em>; and the text is not contained in any Greek manuscript
which was written earlier than the fifteenth
 <span class="lock">century.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_300" id="FNanchor_300">[300]</a></span>
 It was not

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
mentioned by either of the Greek ecclesiastical writers nor by the early
Latin fathers, so anxious to get at every proof in support of their trinity;
and it was omitted by Luther in his German version. Edward Gibbon
was early in pointing out its spurious character. Archbishop Newcome
rejected it, and the Bishop of Lincoln expresses his conviction that it is
 <span class="lock">spurious.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_301" id="FNanchor_301">[301]</a></span>
 There are twenty-eight Greek authors—Irenæus, Clemens,
and Athanasius included, who neither quote nor mention it; and seventeen
Latin writers, numbering among them Augustine, Jerome, Ambrosius,
Cyprian, and Pope Eusebius, who appear utterly ignorant of it.
“It is evident that if the text of the heavenly witnesses had been known
from the beginning of Christianity the ancients would have eagerly seized
it, inserted it in their creeds, quoted it repeatedly against the heretics,
and selected it for the brightest ornament of every book that they wrote
upon the subject of the <span class="lock">Trinity.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_302" id="FNanchor_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus falls to the ground the strongest trinitarian pillar. Another not
less obvious forgery is quoted from Sir Isaac Newton’s words by the editor
of the <cite>Apocryphal New Testament</cite>. Newton observes “that what the
Latins have done to this text (<cite>First Epistle of John</cite>,
 <abbr title="five">v.</abbr>), the Greeks have
done to that of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul (<cite>Timothy</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 16).”
 For, by changing ΟΣ into ΘΣ,
the abbreviation of Θεος (God), in the Alexandrian manuscript, from which
their subsequent copies were made, they now read, “<cite>Great is the mystery
of godliness</cite>, <span class="smcap">God</span> <cite>manifested in the flesh</cite>;” whereas all the churches, for
the first four or five centuries, and the authors of all the ancient versions,
Jerome, as well as the rest, read: “Great is the mystery of godliness
<span class="allsmcap">WHICH WAS</span> <em>manifested in the flesh</em>.” Newton adds, that now that the disputes
over this forgery are over, they that read <span class="smcap">God</span> made manifest in
the flesh, instead of the <em>godliness which was</em> manifested in the flesh,
think this passage “one of the most obvious and pertinent texts for the
business.”</p>

<p>And now we ask again the question: Who were the first Christians?
Those who were readily converted by the eloquent simplicity of Paul, who
promised them, with the name of Jesus, <em>freedom</em> from the narrow bonds of
ecclesiasticism. They understood but one thing; they were the “children
of promise” (<cite>Galatians</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 28). The “allegory” of the Mosaic
<cite>Bible</cite> was unveiled to them; the covenant “from the Mount Sinai which
gendereth <em>to bondage</em>” was Agar (Ibid., 24), the old Jewish synagogue,
and she was “in bondage with her children” to Jerusalem, the new and
the free, “the mother of us all.” On the one hand the synagogue and
the law which persecuted every one who dared to step across the narrow

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
path of bigotry and dogmatism; on the other,
 <span class="lock">Paganism<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_303" id="FNanchor_303">[303]</a></span>
 with its grand
philosophical truths concealed from sight; unveiling itself but to the few,
and leaving the masses hopelessly seeking to discover who was <em>the</em> god,
among this overcrowded pantheon of deities and sub-deities. To others,
the apostle of circumcision, supported by all his followers, was promising,
if they obeyed the “law,” a life hereafter, and a resurrection of which
they had no previous idea. At the same time he never lost an occasion
to contradict Paul without naming him, but indicating him so clearly
that it is next to impossible to doubt whom Peter meant. While he may
have converted some men, who whether they had believed in the Mosaic
resurrection promised by the Pharisees, or had fallen into the nihilistic
doctrines of the Sadducees, or had belonged to the polytheistic heathenism
of the Pagan rabble, had no future after death, nothing but a mournful
blank, we do not think that the work of contradiction, carried on so
systematically by the two apostles, had helped much their work of proselytism.
With the educated thinking classes they succeeded very little,
as ecclesiastical history clearly shows. Where was the truth; where
the inspired word of God? On the one hand, as we have seen, they
heard the apostle Paul explaining that of the two covenants, “which
things are an allegory,” the old one from Mount Sinai, “which gendereth
unto bondage,” was <i>Agar</i> the bondwoman; and Mount Sinai itself
answered to “Jerusalem,” which now is “in bondage” with her circumcised
children; and the new covenant meant Jesus Christ—the “Jerusalem
which is above and free;” and on the other Peter, who was
contradicting and even abusing him. Paul vehemently exclaims,
“Cast out the bondwoman and her son” (the old <em>law</em> and the synagogue).
“The son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the freewoman.” “Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ
hath made us free; be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage....
Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall
profit you nothing!” (<abbr title="Galatians verse"><cite>Gal.</cite> v.</abbr> 2). What do we find Peter writing?
Whom does he mean by saying, “These who speak great swelling words
of vanity.... While they promise them <em>liberty</em>, they themselves are
servants of corruption, for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he
brought in bondage.... For if <em>they have escaped</em> the pollution of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour, they are again
entangled therein, and overcome ... it had <em>been better for them not to
have known the way of righteousness</em>, than after they have known it
to turn from the holy <em>commandment delivered unto them</em>” (<cite>Second
Epistle</cite>).</p>

<p>Peter certainly cannot have meant the Gnostics, for they had never
seen “the holy commandment delivered unto them;” Paul had. They
never promised any one “liberty” from bondage, but Paul had done so
repeatedly. Moreover the latter rejects the “old covenant,” Agar the
bondwoman; and Peter holds fast to it. Paul warns the people against
the <em>powers</em> and <em>dignities</em> (the lower angels of the kabalists); and Peter,
as will be shown further, respects them and <em>denounces those who do not</em>.
Peter preaches circumcision, and Paul forbids it.</p>

<p>Later, when all these extraordinary blunders, contradictions, dissensions
and inventions were forcibly crammed into a frame elaborately
executed by the episcopal caste of the new religion, and called Christianity;
and the chaotic picture itself cunningly preserved from too
close scrutiny by a whole array of formidable Church penances and
anathemas, which kept the curious back under the false pretense of
sacrilege and profanation of divine mysteries; and millions of people had
been butchered in the name of the God of mercy—then came the
Reformation. It certainly deserves its name in its fullest paradoxical
sense. It abandoned Peter and alleges to have chosen Paul for its only
leader. And the apostle who thundered against the old law of bondage;
who left full liberty to Christians to either observe the Sabbath or set
it aside; who rejects everything anterior to John the Baptist, is now the
professed standard-bearer of Protestantism, which holds to the <em>old</em> law
more than the Jews, imprisons those who view the Sabbath as Jesus and
Paul did, and outvies the synagogue of the first century in dogmatic intolerance!</p>

<p>But who then <em>were</em> the first Christians, may still be asked? Doubtless
the Ebionites; and in this we follow the authority of the best critics.
“There can be little doubt that the author (of the <cite>Clementine Homilies</cite>)
was a representative of Ebionitic Gnosticism, which <em>had once been the</em>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>

<em>purest form of primitive</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Christianity</em>....”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_304" id="FNanchor_304">[304]</a></span>
 And who were the Ebionites?
The pupils and followers of the early Nazarenes, the kabalistic
Gnostics. In the preface to the <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>, the translator says:
“That also the Nazarenes did not reject ... the Æons is natural. For
of the Ebionites who acknowledged them (the Æons), these were the <span class="lock">instructors.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_305" id="FNanchor_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>We find, moreover, Epiphanius, the Christian Homer of <cite>The Heresies</cite>,
telling us that “Ebion had the opinion of the Nazarenes, the form of the
Cerinthians (who fable that the world was put together by angels), and
the appellation of
 <span class="lock">Christians.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_306" id="FNanchor_306">[306]</a></span>
 An appellation certainly more correctly
applied to them than to the orthodox (so-called) Christians of the school
of Irenæus and the later Vatican. Renan shows the Ebionites numbering
among their sect all the surviving relatives of Jesus. John the
Baptist, his cousin and <em>precursor</em>, was the accepted Saviour of the Nazarenes,
and their prophet. His disciples dwelt on the other side of the
Jordan, and the scene of the baptism of the Jordan is clearly and beyond
any question proved by the author of <cite>Sod, the Son of the Man</cite>, to have
been the site of the Adonis-worship.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_307" id="FNanchor_307">[307]</a> “Over the Jordan and beyond the
lake dwelt the Nazarenes, a sect said to have existed already at the birth
of Jesus, and to have counted him among its number. They must have
extended along the east of the Jordan, and southeasterly among the Arabians
(<abbr title="Galatians one"><cite>Galat.</cite> i.</abbr> 17, 21; <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 11), and Sabæans in the direction of Bosra; and
again, they must have gone far north over the Lebanon to Antioch, also
to the northeast to the Nazarian settlement in Berœa, where <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome
found them. In the desert the Mysteries of Adonis may have still prevailed;
in the mountains Aiai Adonai was still a <span class="lock">cry.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_308" id="FNanchor_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Having been united (conjunctus) to the Nazarenes, each (Ebionite)
imparted to the other out of his own wickedness, and decided that Christ
<em>was of the seed of a man</em>,” writes Epiphanius.</p>

<p>And if they did, we must suppose they knew more about their contemporary
prophet than Epiphanius 400 years later. Theodoret, as
shown elsewhere, describes the Nazarenes as Jews who “honor the
Anointed as a just man,” and use the <em>evangel</em> called “<cite>According to
Peter</cite>.” Jerome finds the authentic and original <em>evangel</em>, written in
Hebrew, by Matthew the apostle-publican, in the library collected at
Cæsarea, by the martyr Pamphilius. “<em>I received permission from the
Nazaræans</em>, who at Berœa of Syria used this (gospel) to translate it,” he

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
writes toward the end of the fourth century.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_309" id="FNanchor_309">[309]</a>
 “In the <em>evangel</em> which
the <em>Nazarenes</em> and <em>Ebionites</em> use,” adds Jerome, “which recently I translated
from Hebrew into
 <span class="lock">Greek,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_310" id="FNanchor_310">[310]</a></span>
 and which is called by most persons the
<em>genuine Gospel of Matthew</em>,” etc.</p>

<p>That the apostles had received a “secret doctrine” from Jesus, and
that he himself taught one, is evident from the following words of Jerome,
who confessed it in an unguarded moment. Writing to the Bishops
Chromatius and Heliodorus, he complains that “a difficult work is
enjoined, since this translation has been commanded me by your Felicities,
which <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Matthew himself, the Apostle and Evangelist</em>, <span class="allsmcap">DID NOT
WISH TO BE OPENLY WRITTEN</span>. For if it had not been <span class="allsmcap">SECRET</span>, he (Matthew)
would have added to the <em>evangel</em> that which he gave forth was
his; but he made up this book sealed up in the Hebrew characters,
which he put forth <em>even in such a way</em> that the book, written in Hebrew
letters and <em>by the hand of himself</em>, might be possessed <em>by the men most
religious</em>, who also, in the course of time, received it from those who preceded
them. But this very book they never gave to any one to be transcribed,
and its <em>text</em> they related some one way and some another.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_311" id="FNanchor_311">[311]</a>
And he adds further on the same page: “And it happened that this
book, having been published by a disciple of Manichæus, named Seleucus,
who also wrote falsely <cite>The Acts of the Apostles</cite>, exhibited matter not for
edification, but for destruction; and that this book was approved in a
synod which the ears of the Church properly refused to listen <span class="lock">to.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_312" id="FNanchor_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>He admits, himself, that the book which he authenticates as being written
“<em>by the hand of Matthew</em>;” a book which, notwithstanding that he

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
translated it twice, was nearly unintelligible to him, for it was arcane
or <em>a secret</em>. Nevertheless, Jerome coolly sets down every commentary
upon it, except his own, as <em>heretical</em>. More than that, Jerome knew
that this <em>original Gospel of Matthew</em> was the expounder of the only true
doctrine of Christ; and that it was the work of an evangelist who had
been the friend and companion of Jesus. He knew that if of the two
<cite>Gospels</cite>, the Hebrew in question and the Greek belonging to our present
Scripture, one was spurious, hence heretical, it was not that of the Nazarenes;
and yet, knowing all this, Jerome becomes more zealous than ever
in his persecutions of the “Hæretics.” Why? Because to accept it
was equivalent to reading the death-sentence of the established Church.
The <cite>Gospel according to the Hebrews</cite> was but too well known to have
been the only one accepted for four centuries by the Jewish Christians,
the Nazarenes and the Ebionites. And neither of the latter accepted the
<em>divinity</em> of Christ.</p>

<p>If the commentaries of Jerome on the Prophets, his famous <cite>Vulgate</cite>,
and numerous polemical treatises are all as trustworthy as this version
of the <cite>Gospel according to Matthew</cite>, then we have a divine revelation
indeed.</p>

<p>Why wonder at the unfathomable mysteries of the Christian religion,
since it is perfectly <em>human</em>? Have we not a letter written by one of the
most respected Fathers of the Church to this same Jerome, which shows
better than whole volumes their traditionary policy? This is what <em>Saint</em>
Gregory of Nazianzen wrote to his friend and confidant <em>Saint</em> Jerome:
“Nothing can impose better on a people than <em>verbiage</em>; the less they
understand the more they admire. Our fathers and doctors have often
said, not what they thought, but what circumstances and necessity forced
them to.”</p>

<p>But to return to our Sophia-Achamoth and the belief of the genuine,
primitive Christians.</p>

<p>After having produced Ilda-Baoth, Ilda from ילד, a child, and Baoth
from בויץ <a id="hebrew2"></a>, the egg, or בהות, <i>Baoth</i>, a waste, a desolation, Sophia-Achamoth
suffered so much from the contact with matter, that after extraordinary
struggles she escapes at last out of the muddy chaos. Although unacquainted
with the pleroma, the region of her mother, she reached the
middle space and succeeded in shaking off the material parts which
have stuck to her spiritual nature; after which she immediately built a
strong barrier between the world of intelligences (spirits) and the world
of matter. Ilda-Baoth, is thus the “son of darkness,” the creator of our
sinful world (the physical portion of it). He follows the example of
Bythos and produces from himself six stellar spirits (sons). They are all
in his own image, and reflections one of the other, which become darker

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
as they successively recede from their father. With the latter, they all
inhabit seven regions disposed like a ladder, beginning under the middle
space, the region of their mother, Sophia-Achamoth, and ending with our
earth, the <em>seventh</em> region. Thus they are the genii of the seven planetary
spheres of which the lowest is the region of our earth (the sphere which
surrounds it, our æther). The respective names of these genii of the
spheres are <i>Iòve</i> (Jehovah), <i>Sabaoth</i>, <i>Adonai</i>, <i>Eloi</i>, <i>Ouraios</i>, <i>Astaphaios</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_313" id="FNanchor_313">[313]</a>
The first four, as every one knows, are the mystic names of the Jewish
“Lord
 <span class="lock">God,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_314" id="FNanchor_314">[314]</a></span>
 he being, as C. W. King expresses it, “thus degraded by the
Ophites into the appellations of the subordinates of the Creator; “the
two last names are those of the genii of fire and water.”</p>

<p>Ilda-Baoth, whom several sects regarded as the God of Moses, was
not a pure spirit; he was ambitious and proud, and rejecting the spiritual
light of the middle space offered him by his mother Sophia-Achamoth,
he set himself to create a world of his own. Aided by his sons, the six
planetary genii, he fabricated man, but this one proved a failure. It
was a monster; soulless, ignorant, and crawling on all fours on the
ground like a material beast. Ilda-Baoth was forced to implore the help
of his spiritual mother. She communicated to him a ray of her divine
light, and so animated man and endowed him with a soul. And now
began the animosity of Ilda-Baoth toward his own creature. Following
the impulse of the divine light, man soared higher and higher in his aspirations;
very soon he began presenting not the image of his Creator
Ilda-Baoth but rather that of the Supreme Being, the “primitive man,”
Ennoia. Then the Demiurgus was filled with rage and envy; and fixing
his jealous eye on the abyss of matter, his looks envenomed with passion
were suddenly reflected in it as in a mirror; the reflection became animate,
and there arose out of the abyss Satan, serpent, Ophiomorphos—“the
embodiment of envy and of cunning. He is the union of all that
is most base in matter, with the hate, envy, and craft of a spiritual <span class="lock">intelligence.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_315" id="FNanchor_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>After that, always in spite at the perfection of man, Ilda-Baoth created
the three kingdoms of nature, the mineral, vegetable, and animal, with all
evil instincts and properties. Impotent to annihilate the Tree of Knowledge,
which grows in his sphere as in every one of the planetary regions,
but bent upon detaching “man” from his spiritual protectress, Ilda-Baoth
forbade him to eat of its fruit, for fear it should reveal to mankind the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
mysteries of the superior world. But Sophia-Achamoth, who loved and
protected the man whom she had animated, sent her own genius Ophis, in
the form of a serpent to induce man to transgress the selfish and unjust
command. And “man” suddenly became capable of comprehending
the mysteries of creation.</p>

<p>Ilda-Baoth revenged himself by punishing the first pair, for man,
through his <em>knowledge</em>, had already provided for himself a companion out
of his spiritual and material half. He imprisoned man and woman in a
dungeon of matter, in the body so unworthy of his nature, wherein man
is still enthralled. But Achamoth protected him still. She established
between her celestial region and “man,” a current of divine light, and
kept constantly supplying him with this <em>spiritual</em> illumination.</p>

<p>Then follow allegories embodying the idea of dualism, or the struggle
between good and evil, spirit and matter, which is found in every cosmogony,
and the source of which is again to be sought in India. The
types and antitypes represent the heroes of this Gnostic Pantheon, borrowed
from the most ancient mythopœic ages. But, in these personages,
Ophis and Ophiomorphos, Sophia and Sophia-Achamoth, Adam-Kadmon,
and Adam, the planetary genii and the divine Æons, we can also recognize
very easily the models of our biblical copies—the euhemerized patriarchs.
The archangels, angels, virtues and powers, are all found, under
other names, in the <cite>Vedas</cite> and the Buddhistic system. The Avestic
Supreme Being, Zero-ana, or “Boundless Time,” is the type of all these
Gnostic and kabalistic “Depths,” “Crowns,” and even of the Chaldean
En-Soph. The six Amshaspands, created through the “Word” of Ormazd,
the “First-Born,” have their reflections in Bythos and his emanations,
and the antitype of Ormazd—Ahriman and his devs also enter
into the composition of Ilda-Baoth and his six <em>material</em>, though not wholly
evil, planetary genii.</p>

<p>Achamoth, afflicted with the evils which befall humanity, notwithstanding
her protection, beseeches the celestial mother Sophia—her antitype—to
prevail on the unknown <span class="smcap">Depth</span> to send down Christos (the son and
emanation of the “Celestial Virgin”) to the help of perishing humanity.
Ilda-Baoth and his six sons of matter are shutting out the divine light
from mankind. Man must be saved. Ilda-Baoth had already sent his
own agent, John the Baptist, from the race of Seth, whom he protects—as
a prophet to his people; but only a small portion listened to him—the
Nazarenes, the opponents of the Jews, on account of their worshipping
 <span class="lock">Iurbo-Adunai.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_316" id="FNanchor_316">[316]</a></span>
 Achamoth had assured her son, Ilda-Baoth, that the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
reign of Christos would be only temporal, and thus induced him to send
the forerunner, or precursor. Besides that, she made <em>him cause</em> the birth
of the <em>man</em> Jesus from the Virgin Mary, her own type on earth, “for
the creation of a material personage could only be the work of the Demiurgus,
not falling within the province of a higher power. As soon as
Jesus was born, Christos, the perfect, uniting himself with Sophia (wisdom
and spirituality), descended through the seven planetary regions, assuming
in each an analogous form, and concealing his true nature from their
genii, while he attracted into himself the sparks of divine light which they
retained in their essence. Thus, Christos entered into the <em>man</em> Jesus at
the moment of his baptism in the Jordan. From that time Jesus began
to work miracles; before that, he had been completely ignorant of his
<span class="lock">mission.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_317" id="FNanchor_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>Ilda-Baoth, discovering that Christos was bringing to an end his own
kingdom of matter, stirred up the Jews against him, and Jesus was put to
 <span class="lock">death.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_318" id="FNanchor_318">[318]</a></span>
 When on the Cross, Christos and Sophia left his body and returned
to their own sphere. The material body of the man Jesus was
abandoned to the earth, but he himself was given a body made up of
<i>æther</i> (astral soul). “Thenceforward he consisted of merely <em>soul</em> and
<em>spirit</em>,” which was the reason why the disciples did not recognize him after
the resurrection. In this spiritual state of a <em>simulacrum</em>, Jesus remained
on earth for eighteen months after he had risen. During this last
sojourn, “he received from Sophia that perfect knowledge, that true
Gnosis, <em>which he communicated to the very few among the apostles</em> who
were capable of receiving the same.”</p>

<p>“Thence, ascending up into the middle space, he sits on the right
hand of Ilda-Baoth, but unperceived by him, and there collects all the
souls which shall have been purified by the knowledge of Christ. When
he has collected all the spiritual light that exists in matter, out of Ilda-Baoth’s
empire, the redemption will be accomplished and the world will
be destroyed. Such is the meaning of the re-absorption of all the spiritual
light into the pleroma or fulness, whence it originally descended.”</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
The foregoing is from the description given by Theodoret and adopted
by King in his <cite>Gnostics</cite>, with additions from Epiphanius and Irenæus.
But the former gives a very imperfect version, concocted partly from the
descriptions of Irenæus, and partly from his own knowledge of the later
Ophites, who, toward the end of the third century, had blended already
with several other sects. Irenæus also confounds them very frequently,
and the real theogony of the Ophites is given by none of them correctly.
With the exception of a change in names, the above-given theogony is
that of all the Gnostics, and also of the Nazarenes. Ophis is but the
successor of the Egyptian <i>Chnuphis</i>, the Good Serpent with a lion’s radiating
head, and was held from days of the highest antiquity as an emblem
of wisdom, or Thauth, the instructor and Saviour of humanity, the “Son
of God.” “Oh men, live soberly ... win your immortality!” exclaims
Hermes, the thrice-great Trismegistus. “Instructor and guide of humanity,
I will lead you on to salvation.” Thus the oldest sectarians regarded
Ophis, the Agathodæmon, as identical with Christos; the serpent being
the emblem of celestial wisdom and eternity, and, in the present case, the
antitype of the Egyptian Chnuphis-serpent. These Gnostics, the earliest
of our Christian era, held: “That the supreme Æon, having emitted other
Æons out of himself, one of them, a female, <i>Prunnikos</i> (concupiscence),
descended into the chaos, whence, unable to escape, she remained suspended
in the mid-space, being too clogged by matter to return above, and
not falling lower where there was nothing in affinity with her nature. She
then produced her son Ilda-Baoth, the God of the Jews, who, in his turn,
produced seven Æons, or
 <span class="lock">angels,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_319" id="FNanchor_319">[319]</a></span>
 who created the seven heavens.”</p>

<p>In this plurality of heavens the Christians believed from the first, for
we find Paul teaching of their existence, and speaking of a man “caught
up to the <em>third</em> heaven” (2 <abbr title="Corinthians thirteen"><cite>Corin.</cite>,
 xiii.</abbr>). From these seven angels
Ilda-Baoth shut up all that was above him, lest they should know of anything
superior to himself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_320" id="FNanchor_320">[320]</a>
 They then created man in the image of their
Father,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_321" id="FNanchor_321">[321]</a>
 but prone and crawling on the earth like a worm. But the
heavenly mother, Prunnikos, wishing to deprive Ilda-Baoth of the power


<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
with which she had unwittingly endowed him, infused into man a celestial
spark—the spirit. Immediately man rose upon his feet, soared in mind
beyond the limits of the seven spheres, and glorified the Supreme Father,
<em>Him that is above Ilda-Baoth</em>. Hence, the latter, full of jealousy, cast
down his eyes upon the lowest stratum of matter, and begot a potency in
the form of a serpent, whom they (the Ophites) call his son. Eve, obeying
him as the son of God, was persuaded to eat of the Tree of <span class="lock">Knowledge.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_322" id="FNanchor_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a self-evident fact that the serpent of the <cite>Genesis</cite>, who appears
suddenly and without any preliminary introduction, must have been the
antitype of the Persian Arch-Devs, whose head is Ash-Mogh, the “two-footed
serpent of lies.” If the <em>Bible</em>-serpent had been deprived of his
limbs before he had tempted woman unto sin, why should God specify as
a punishment that he should go “upon his belly?” Nobody supposes
that he walked upon the extremity of his tail.</p>

<p>This controversy about the supremacy of Jehovah, between the Presbyters
and Fathers on the one hand, and the Gnostics, the Nazarenes,
and all the sects declared heterodox, as a last resort, on the other, lasted
till the days of Constantine, and later. That the peculiar ideas of the
Gnostics about the <em>genealogy</em> of Jehovah, or the proper place that had
to be assigned, in the Christian-Gnostic Pantheon, to the God of the Jews,
were at first deemed neither blasphemous nor heterodox is evident
in the difference of opinions held on this question by Clemens of Alexandria,
for instance, and Tertullian. The former, who seems to have
known of Basilides better than anybody else, saw nothing heterodox or
blamable in the mystical and transcendental views of the new Reformer.
“In his eyes,” remarks the author of <cite>The Gnostics</cite>, speaking of
Clemens, “Basilides was not a heretic, <i>i.e.</i>, an innovator as regards the
doctrines of the Christian Church, but a mere theosophic philosopher,
who sought to express <em>ancient truths</em> under new forms, and perhaps to
combine them with the new faith, the truth of which he could admit
without necessarily renouncing the old, exactly as is the case with the
learned Hindus of our <span class="lock">day.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_323" id="FNanchor_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so with Irenæus and
 <span class="lock">Tertullian.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_324" id="FNanchor_324">[324]</a></span>
 The principal works of the
latter <em>against the Heretics</em>, were written after his separation from the
Catholic Church, when he had ranged himself among the zealous followers
of Montanus; and teem with unfairness and bigoted prejudice.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_325" id="FNanchor_325">[325]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span>
He has exaggerated every Gnostic opinion to a monstrous absurdity,
and his arguments are not based on coercive reasoning but simply on
the blind stubbornness of a partisan fanatic. Discussing Basilides, the
“pious, god-like, theosophic philosopher,” as Clemens of Alexandria
thought him, Tertullian exclaims: “After this, Basilides, the <i>heretic</i>,
broke
 <span class="lock">loose.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_326" id="FNanchor_326">[326]</a></span>
 He asserted that there is a Supreme God, by name
Abraxas, by whom Mind was created, whom the Greeks call <i>Nous</i>.
From her emanated the Word; from the Word, Providence; from Providence,
Virtue and Wisdom; from these two again, Virtues, <i>Principalities,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_327" id="FNanchor_327">[327]</a>
and Powers</i> were made; thence infinite productions and emissions
of angels. Among the lowest angels, indeed, and those that
made this world, he sets <i>last of all</i> the god of the Jews, whom he denies
to be God himself, affirming that he is but one of the <span class="lock">angels.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_328" id="FNanchor_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be equally useless to refer to the direct apostles of Christ,
and show them as holding in their controversies that Jesus never made
any difference between his “Father” and the “Lord-God” of Moses.
For the <i>Clementine Homilies</i>, in which occur the greatest argumentations
upon the subject, as shown in the disputations alleged to have taken
place between Peter and Simon the Magician, are now also proved to
have been falsely attributed to Clement the Roman. This work, if written
by an Ebionite—as the author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> declares in common
with some other commentators<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_329" id="FNanchor_329">[329]</a>—must have been written either far
later than the Pauline period, generally assigned to it, or the dispute

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
about the identity of Jehovah with God, the “Father of Jesus,” have
been distorted by later interpolations. This disputation is in its very
essence antagonistic to the early doctrines of the Ebionites. The latter,
as demonstrated by Epiphanius and Theodoret, were the direct followers
of the Nazarene sect<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_330" id="FNanchor_330">[330]</a> (the Sabians), the “Disciples of John.” He
says, unequivocally, that the Ebionites believed in the <cite>Æons</cite> (emanations),
that the Nazarenes were <em>their instructors</em>, and that “each imparted
to the other out of his own wickedness.” Therefore, holding the same
beliefs as the Nazarenes did, an Ebionite would not have given even so
much chance to the doctrine supported by Peter in the <cite>Homilies</cite>. The
old Nazarenes, as well as the later ones, whose views are embodied in
the <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>, never called Jehovah otherwise than <i>Adonai</i>,
<i>Iurbo</i>, the God of the <i>Abortive</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_331" id="FNanchor_331">[331]</a> (the orthodox Jews). They kept
their beliefs and religious tenets so <em>secret</em> that even Epiphanius, writing
as early as the end of the fourth
 <span class="lock">century,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_332" id="FNanchor_332">[332]</a></span>
 confesses his ignorance as to
their real doctrine. “Dropping the name of Jesus,” says the Bishop of
Salamis, “they neither call themselves <i>Iessaens</i>, nor continue to hold the
name of the Jews, nor name themselves Christians, but <i>Nazarenes</i>....
The resurrection of the dead is confessed by them ... but concerning
Christ, <em>I cannot say</em> whether they think him a <em>mere man</em>, or as the <em>truth
is</em>, confess that he was born through the <em>Holy Pneuma</em> from the <span class="lock">Virgin.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_333" id="FNanchor_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>While Simon Magus argues in the <cite>Homilies</cite> from the standpoint of
every Gnostic (Nazarenes and Ebionites included), Peter, as a true
apostle of circumcision, holds to the old Law and, as a matter of course,
seeks to blend his belief in the divinity of Christ with his old Faith in
the “Lord God” and ex-protector of the “chosen people.” As the
author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> shows, the Epitome,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_334" id="FNanchor_334">[334]</a> “a blending of
the other two, probably intended to purge them from heretical doctrine”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_335" id="FNanchor_335">[335]</a>
and, together with a great majority of critics, assigns to the
<cite>Homilies</cite>, a date not earlier than the end of the third century, we may
well infer that they must differ widely with their original, if there ever
was one. Simon the Magician proves throughout the whole work that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
the Demiurgus, the Architect of the World, is not the highest Deity;
and he bases his assertions upon the words of Jesus himself, who states
repeatedly that “no man knew the Father.” Peter is made in the
<cite>Homilies</cite> to repudiate, with a great show of indignation, the assertion that
the Patriarchs were not deemed worthy to know the Father; to which
Simon objects again by quoting the words of Jesus, who thanks the
“Lord of Heaven and earth that what was concealed from the wise”
he has “revealed to babes,” proving very logically that according to
these very words the Patriarchs could not have known the “Father.”
Then Peter argues, in his turn, that the expression, “what is <em>concealed</em>
from the wise,” etc., referred to the concealed <em>mysteries</em>
 of the <span class="lock">creation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_336" id="FNanchor_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>This argumentation of Peter, therefore, had it even emanated from
the apostle himself, instead of being a “religious romance,” as the author
of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> calls it, would prove nothing whatever in favor
of the identity of the God of the Jews, with the “Father” of Jesus. At
best it would only demonstrate that Peter had remained from first to last
“an apostle of circumcision,” a Jew faithful to his old law, and a defender
of the <cite>Old Testament</cite>. This conversation proves, moreover, the weakness
of the cause he defends, for we see in the apostle a man who,
although in most intimate relations with Jesus, can furnish us nothing in
the way of direct proof that he ever thought of teaching that the all-wise
and all-good Paternity he preached was the morose and revengeful thunderer
of Mount Sinai. But what the <cite>Homilies</cite> do prove, is again our
assertion that there was a secret doctrine preached by Jesus to the few
who were deemed worthy to become its recipients and custodians. “And
Peter said: ‘We remember that our Lord and teacher, as commanding,
said to us, guard the mysteries for me, and the sons of my house. Wherefore
also he explained to his disciples, <em>privately</em>, the <em>mysteries of the kingdoms
of the heavens</em>.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_337" id="FNanchor_337">[337]</a></p>

<p>If we now recall the fact that a portion of the Mysteries of the
“Pagans” consisted of the απορῥήτα, <i>aporrheta</i>, or secret discourses; that
the secret <i>Logia</i> or discourses of Jesus contained in the original <cite>Gospel
according to Matthew</cite>, the meaning and interpretation of which <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome
confessed to be “a difficult task” for him to achieve, were of the same
nature; and if we remember, further, that to some of the interior or final
Mysteries only a very select few were admitted; and that finally it was
from the number of the latter that were taken all the ministers of the holy
“Pagan” rites, we will then clearly understand this expression of Jesus
quoted by Peter: “Guard <em>the Mysteries for me and the sons of my

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
house</em>,” <i>i.e.</i>, of my doctrine. And, if we understand it rightly, we cannot
avoid thinking that this “secret” doctrine of Jesus, even the technical
expressions of which are but so many duplications of the Gnostic and
Neo-platonic mystic phraseology—that this doctrine, we say, was based
on the same transcendental philosophy of Oriental <cite>Gnosis</cite> as the rest of
the religions of those and earliest days. That none of the later Christian
sects, despite their boasting, were the inheritors of it, is evident from the
contradictions, blunders, and clumsy repatching of the mistakes of every
preceding century by the discoveries of the succeeding one. These mistakes,
in a number of manuscripts claimed to be authentic, are sometimes
so ridiculous as to bear on their face the evidence of being pious forgeries.
Thus, for instance, the utter ignorance of some patristic champions of
the very gospels they claimed to defend. We have mentioned the accusation
against Marcion by Tertullian and Epiphanius of mutilating the
<em>Gospel</em> ascribed to Luke, and erasing from it that which is now proved
to have never been in that Gospel at all. Finally, the method adopted
by Jesus of speaking in parables, in which he only followed the example
of his sect, is attributed in the <cite>Homilies</cite> to a prophecy of <cite>Isaiah</cite>! Peter
is made to remark: “For Isaiah said: ‘I will open my mouth in parables,
and I will utter things that have been kept secret from the foundation
of the world.’” This erroneous reference to Isaiah of a sentence
given in <cite>Psalms</cite> <abbr title="seventy-eight">lxxviii.</abbr> 2, is found not only in the apocryphal <cite>Homilies</cite>,
but also in the Sinaitic <cite>Codex</cite>. Commenting on the fact in the <i>Supernatural
Religion</i>, the author states that “Porphyry, in the third century,
twitted Christians with this erroneous ascription by their inspired evangelist
to Isaiah of a passage from a <cite>Psalm</cite>, and reduced the Fathers to great
 <span class="lock">straits.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_338" id="FNanchor_338">[338]</a></span>
 Eusebius and Jerome tried to get out of the difficulty by
ascribing the mistake to an “ignorant scribe;” and Jerome even went
to the length of asserting that the name of Isaiah never stood after the
above sentence in any of the old codices, but that the name of Asaph was
found in its place, only “<em>ignorant</em> men had removed
 <span class="lock">it.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_339" id="FNanchor_339">[339]</a></span>
 To this, the
author again observes that “the fact is that the reading ‘Asaph’ for
‘Isaiah’ is not found in any manuscript extant; and, although ‘Isaiah’
has <em>disappeared</em> from all but a few obscure codices, it cannot be denied
that the name anciently stood in the text. In the Sinaitic <cite>Codex</cite>, which
is probably the earliest manuscript extant ... and which is assigned to
the fourth century,” he adds, “the prophet <cite>Isaiah</cite> stands in the text by
the first hand, <em>but is erased</em> by the <span class="lock">second.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_340" id="FNanchor_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a most suggestive fact that there is not a word in the so-called

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">193</a></span>
sacred <em>Scriptures</em> to show that Jesus was actually regarded as a God by
his disciples. Neither before nor after his death did they pay him divine
honors. Their relation to him was only that of disciples and “master;”
by which name they addressed him, as the followers of Pythagoras and
Plato addressed their respective masters before them. Whatever words
may have been put into the mouths of Jesus, Peter, John, Paul, and
others, there is not a single act of adoration recorded on their part, nor
did Jesus himself ever declare his identity with <em>his Father</em>. He accused
the Pharisees of <em>stoning</em> their prophets, not of deicide. He termed himself
the son of God, but took care to assert repeatedly that they were
all the children of God, who was the Heavenly Father of all. In preaching
this, he but repeated a doctrine taught ages earlier by Hermes,
Plato, and other philosophers. Strange contradiction! Jesus, whom we
are asked to worship as the one living God, is found, immediately after
his Resurrection, saying to Mary Magdalene: “I am not yet ascended
<em>to my Father</em>; but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto
<em>my Father</em> and <em>your</em> Father, and to <em>my</em> God and
 <em>your</em> God!” (<cite>John</cite>
<abbr title="twenty">xx.</abbr> 17.)</p>

<p>Does this look like identifying himself with his Father? “<em>My</em> Father
and <em>your</em> Father, <em>my</em> God and <em>your</em> God,” implies,
 on his part, a desire to
be considered on a perfect equality with his brethren—nothing more.
Theodoret writes: “The hæretics agree with us respecting the beginning
of all things.... But they say there is not one Christ (God), but one
above, and the other below. And this last <em>formerly dwelt in many</em>;
but <em>the Jesus</em>, they at one time say is <em>from</em> God, at another they
call him a
 <span class="lock"><span class="smcap">Spirit</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_341" id="FNanchor_341">[341]</a></span>
 This spirit is the Christos, the <i>messenger</i>
of life, who is sometimes called the Angel <i>Gabriel</i> (in Hebrew, the
mighty one of God), and who took with the Gnostics the place of the
Logos, while the Holy Spirit was considered
 <span class="lock"><i>Life</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_342" id="FNanchor_342">[342]</a></span>
 With the sect of
the Nazarenes, though, the Spiritus, or Holy Ghost, had less honor.
While nearly every Gnostic sect considered it a Female Power, whether
they called it <i>Binah</i>, נינה, <i>Sophia</i>, the Divine Intellect, with the Nazarene

Jesus enforced and illustrated his doctrines with signs and wonders;
and if we lay aside the claims advanced on his behalf by his deifiers, he
did but what other kabalists did; and only <em>they</em> at that epoch, when, for
two centuries the sources of prophecy had been completely dried up, and
from this stagnation of public “miracles” had originated the skepticism
of the unbelieving sect of the Sadducees. Describing the “heresies” of
those days, Theodoret, who has no idea of the hidden meaning of the
word Christos, the <em>anointed</em> messenger, complains that they (the Gnostics)
assert <i>that this Messenger or Delegatus changes his body from time to
time</i>, “<em>and goes into other bodies, and at each time is differently manifested</em>.
And these (the overshadowed prophets) use incantations and
invocations of various demons and baptisms in the confession of their
principles.... They embrace astrology and magic, and the mathematical
error,” (?) he <span class="lock">says.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_345" id="FNanchor_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>This “mathematical error,” of which the pious writer complains, led
subsequently to the rediscovery of the heliocentric system, erroneous as
it may still be, and forgotten since the days of another “magician” who
taught it—Pythagoras. Thus, the wonders of healing and the thaums
of Jesus, which he imparted to his followers, show that they were learning,
in their daily communication with him, the theory and practice of
the new ethics, day by day, and in the familiar intercourse of intimate
friendship. Their faith was progressively developed, like that of all
neophytes, simultaneously with the increase of knowledge. We must
bear in mind that Josephus, who certainly must have been well informed
on the subject, calls the skill of expelling demons “a science.” This
growth of faith is conspicuously shown in the case of Peter, who, from
having lacked enough faith to support him while he could walk on the
water from the boat to his Master, at last became so expert a thaumaturgist,
that Simon Magus is said to have offered him money to teach him
the secret of healing, and other wonders. And Philip is shown to have
become an Æthrobat as good as Abaris of Pythagorean memory, but less
expert than Simon Magus.</p>

<p>Neither in the <cite>Homilies</cite> nor any other early work of the apostles, is there
anything to show that either of his friends and followers regarded Jesus
as anything more than a prophet. The idea is as clearly established in
the <cite>Clementines</cite>. Except that too much room is afforded to Peter to establish
the identity of the Mosaic God with the Father of Jesus, the whole
work is devoted to Monotheism. The author seems as bitter against
Polytheism as against the claim to the divinity of
 <span class="lock">Christ.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_346" id="FNanchor_346">[346]</a></span>
 He seems

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>

to be utterly ignorant of the Logos, and his speculation is confined to
Sophia, the Gnostic wisdom. There is no trace in it of a hypostatic
trinity, but the same overshadowing of the Gnostic “wisdom (Christos
and Sophia) is attributed in the case of Jesus as it is in those of Adam,
Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
 <span class="lock">Moses.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_347" id="FNanchor_347">[347]</a></span>
 These personages
are all placed on one level, and called ‘true prophets,’ and the seven
pillars of the world.” More than that, Peter vehemently denies the fall
of Adam, and with him, the doctrine of atonement, as taught by Christian
theology, utterly falls to the ground, <em>for he combats it as a
 blasphemy</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_348" id="FNanchor_348">[348]</a>
Peter’s theory of sin is that of the Jewish kabalists, and even, in a certain
way, Platonic. Adam not only never sinned, but, “as a true prophet,
possessed of the Spirit of God, which afterwards was in Jesus, <em>could not</em>
sin.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_349" id="FNanchor_349">[349]</a>
 In short, the whole of the work exhibits the belief of the author
in the kabalistic doctrine of permutation. The <cite>Kabala</cite> teaches the doctrine
of transmigration of the <span class="lock">spirit.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_350" id="FNanchor_350">[350]</a></span>
 “Mosah is the <i>revolutio</i> of Seth
and <span class="lock">Hebel.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_351" id="FNanchor_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell me who it is who brings about the <em>re-birth</em> (the revolutio)?”
is asked of the wise Hermes. “God’s Son, the <em>only man</em>, through the
will of God,” is the answer of the <span class="lock">“heathen.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_352" id="FNanchor_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>“God’s son” is the immortal spirit assigned to every human being.
It is this divine entity which is the “<em>only man</em>,” for the casket which contains
our soul, and the soul itself, are but half-entities, and without its
overshadowing both body and astral soul, the two are but an animal <em>duad</em>.
It requires a trinity to form the complete “man,” and allow him to remain
immortal at every “re-birth,” or <i>revolutio</i>, throughout the subsequent
and ascending spheres, every one of which brings him nearer to the
refulgent realm of eternal and <em>absolute</em> light.</p>

<p>“God’s <span class="smcap">First-born</span>, who is the ‘holy Veil,’ the ‘Light of Lights,’
it is he who sends the revolutio of the Delegatus, for he is the <em>First
Power</em>,” says the <span class="lock">kabalist.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_353" id="FNanchor_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>“The pneuma (spirit) and the dunamis (power), which is from the
God, it is right to consider nothing else than the <i>Logos</i>, who is <em>also</em> (?)
First-begotten to the God,” argues a <span class="lock">Christian.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_354" id="FNanchor_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>“Angels and powers are in heaven!” says Justin, thus bringing
forth a purely kabalistic doctrine. The Christians adopted it from the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span>

<cite>Sohar</cite> and the hæretical sects, and if Jesus mentioned them, it was not in
the official synagogues that he learned the theory, but directly in the
kabalistic teachings. In the Mosaic books, very little mention is made
of them, and Moses, who holds direct communications with the “Lord
God,” troubles himself very little about them. The doctrine was a
secret one, and deemed by the orthodox synagogue heretical. Josephus
calls the Essenes heretics, saying: “Those admitted among the Essenes
must swear to communicate their doctrines to no one any otherwise <em>than
as he received them himself</em>, and equally to preserve the books <em>belonging
to their sect</em>, and the <em>names of the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>angels</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_355" id="FNanchor_355">[355]</a></span>
 The Sadducees did not
believe in angels, neither did the uninitiated Gentiles, who limited their
Olympus to gods and demi-gods, or “spirits.” Alone, the kabalists and
theurgists hold to that doctrine from time immemorial, and, as a consequence,
Plato, and Philo Judæus after him, followed first by the Gnostics,
and then by the Christians.</p>

<p>Thus, if Josephus never wrote the famous interpolation forged by
Eusebius, concerning Jesus, on the other hand, he has described in
the Essenes all the principal features that we find prominent in the Nazarene.
When praying, they sought <span class="lock">solitude.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_356" id="FNanchor_356">[356]</a></span>
 “When thou prayest,
enter into thy closet ... and pray to thy Father which is in secret”
(<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 6). “Everything spoken by them (Essenes) is stronger
than an oath. Swearing is shunned by them” (<cite>Josephus</cite> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr>, 6). “But
I say unto you, swear not at all ... but let your communication be yea,
yea; nay, nay” (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 34-37).</p>

<p>The Nazarenes, as well as the Essenes and the Therapeutæ, believed
more in their own interpretations of the “hidden sense” of the more ancient
Scriptures, than in the later laws of Moses. Jesus, as we have
shown before, felt but little veneration for the commandments of his predecessor,
with whom Irenæus is so anxious to connect him.</p>

<p>The Essenes “enter into the houses of <em>those whom they never saw
previously</em>, as if they were their intimate friends” (<cite>Josephus</cite> <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr>, 4).
Such was undeniably the custom of Jesus and his disciples.</p>

<p>Epiphanius, who places the Ebionite “heresy” on one level with that
of the Nazarenes, also remarks that the Nazaraioi come next to the
<span class="lock">Cerinthians,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_357" id="FNanchor_357">[357]</a></span>
 so much vituperated against by <span class="lock">Irenæus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_358" id="FNanchor_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>

Munk, in his work on <cite>Palestine</cite>, affirms that there were 4,000 Essenes
living in the desert; that they had their mystical books, and predicted the
<span class="lock">future.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_359" id="FNanchor_359">[359]</a></span>
 The Nabatheans, with very little difference indeed, adhered to
the same belief as the Nazarenes and the Sabeans, and all of them
honored John the Baptist more than his successor Jesus. The Persian
Iezidi say that they originally came to Syria from Busrah. They use
baptism, and believe in seven archangels, though paying at the same time
reverence to Satan. Their prophet Iezed, who flourished long prior to
<span class="lock">Mahomet,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_360" id="FNanchor_360">[360]</a></span>
 taught that God will send a messenger, and that the latter
would reveal to him a book which is already written in heaven from the
<span class="lock">eternity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_361" id="FNanchor_361">[361]</a></span>
 The Nabatheans inhabited the Lebanon, as their descendants
do to the present day, and their religion was from its origin purely kabalistic.
Maimonides speaks of them as if he identified them with the Sabeans.
“I will mention to thee the writings ... respecting the belief and
institutions of the <i>Sabeans</i>,” he says. “The most famous is the book <cite>The
Agriculture of the Nabathæans</cite>, which has been translated by Ibn Wahohijah.
This book is full of heathenish foolishness.... It speaks of the
preparations of <span class="smcap">Talismans</span>, the drawing down of the powers of the <span class="smcap">Spirits</span>,
<span class="smcap">Magic</span>, <span class="smcap">Demons</span>,
 and ghouls, which make their abode in the
 <span class="lock">desert.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_362" id="FNanchor_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>There are traditions among the tribes living scattered about <em>beyond</em>
the Jordan, as there are many such also among the descendants of the
Samaritans at Damascus, Gaza, and at Naplosa (the ancient Shechem).
Many of these tribes have, notwithstanding the persecutions of eighteen
centuries, retained the faith of their fathers in its primitive simplicity.
It is there that we have to go for traditions based on <em>historical</em> truths,
however disfigured by exaggeration and inaccuracy, and compare them
with the religious legends of the Fathers, which they call revelation. Eusebius
states that before the siege of Jerusalem the small Christian community—comprising
members of whom many, if not all, knew Jesus and his
apostles personally—took refuge in the little town of Pella, on the opposite
shore of the Jordan. Surely these simple people, separated for centuries
from the rest of the world, ought to have preserved their traditions
fresher than any other nations! It is in Palestine that we have to search
for the <em>clearest</em> waters of Christianity, let alone its source. The first
Christians, after the death of Jesus, all joined together for a time, whether

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>

they were Ebionites, Nazarenes, Gnostics, or others. They had no Christian
dogmas in those days, and their Christianity consisted in believing
Jesus to be a prophet, this belief varying from seeing in him simply a
“just <span class="lock">man,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_363" id="FNanchor_363">[363]</a></span>
 or a holy, inspired prophet, a vehicle used by Christos and
Sophia to manifest themselves through. These all united together in
opposition to the synagogue and the tyrannical technicalities of the Pharisees,
until the primitive group separated in two distinct branches—which,
we may correctly term the Christian kabalists of the Jewish Tanaïm school,
and the Christian kabalists of the Platonic
 <span class="lock">Gnosis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_364" id="FNanchor_364">[364]</a></span>
 The former were
represented by the party composed of the followers of Peter, and John, the
author of the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>; the latter ranged with the Pauline Christianity,
blending itself, at the end of the second century, with the Platonic philosophy,
and engulfing, still later, the Gnostic sects, whose symbols and
misunderstood mysticism overflowed the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>Amid this jumble of contradictions, what Christian is secure in confessing
himself such? In the old Syriac <cite>Gospel according to Luke</cite> (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 22),
the Holy Spirit is said to have descended in the likeness of a dove.
“Jesua, full of the sacred Spirit, returned from Jordan, and the Spirit led
him into the desert” (old Syriac, <cite>Luke</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 1,
 <cite>Tremellius</cite>). “The difficulty,”
says Dunlap, “was that the Gospels declared that John the Baptist
saw the Spirit (the Power of God) descend upon Jesus after he had
reached manhood, and if the Spirit then first descended upon him, there
was some ground for the opinion of the Ebionites and Nazarenes who
denied his <em>preceding</em> existence, and refused him the attributes of the
<span class="smcap">Logos</span>. The Gnostics, on the other hand, objected to the flesh, but conceded
the <span class="lock">Logos.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_365" id="FNanchor_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>John’s <cite>Apocalypsis</cite>, and the explanations of sincere Christian bishops,
like Synesius, who, to the last, adhered to the Platonic doctrines,
make us think that the wisest and safest way is to hold to that sincere
primitive faith which seems to have actuated the above-named bishop.
This best, sincerest, and most unfortunate of Christians, addressing the
“Unknown,” exclaims: “Oh Father of the Worlds ... Father of the
Æons ... <em>Artificer of the Gods</em>, it is holy to praise!” But Synesius
had Hypatia for instructor, and this is why we find him confessing in all
sincerity his opinions and profession of faith. “The rabble desires

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>

nothing better than to be deceived.... As regards myself, therefore,
<em>I will always be a philosopher with myself</em>, but I <em>must be priest</em> with the
people.”</p>

<p>“Holy is God the Father of all being, holy is God, whose wisdom is
carried out into execution by his own Powers!... Holy art Thou, who
through the Word had created all! Therefore, I believe in Thee, and
bear testimony, and go into the <span class="allsmcap">LIFE</span> and
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">LIGHT</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_366" id="FNanchor_366">[366]</a></span>
 Thus speaks
Hermes Trismegistus, the heathen divine. What Christian bishop
could have said better than that?</p>

<p>The apparent discrepancy of the four gospels as a whole, does not
prevent every narrative given in the <cite>New Testament</cite>—however
 much disfigured—having
a ground-work of truth. To this, are cunningly adapted
details made to fit the later exigencies of the Church. So, propped up
partially by indirect evidence, still more by blind faith, they have become,
with time, articles of faith. Even the fictitious massacre of the “Innocents”
by King Herod has a certain foundation to it, in its allegorical
sense. Apart from the now-discovered fact that the whole story of such
a massacre of the Innocents is bodily taken from the Hindu <cite>Bagaved-gitta</cite>,
and Brahmanical traditions, the legend refers, moreover, allegorically,
to an historical fact. King Herod is the type of Kansa, the tyrant
of Madura, the maternal uncle of Christna, to whom astrologers predicted
that a son of his niece Devaki would deprive him of his throne.
Therefore he gives orders to kill the male child that is born to her; but
Christna escapes his fury through the protection of Mahadeva (the great
God) who causes the child to be carried away to another city, out of
Kansa’s reach. After that, in order to be sure and kill the right boy, on
whom he failed to lay his murderous hands, Kansa has all the male newborn
infants within his kingdom killed. Christna is also worshipped by
the gopas (the shepherds) of the land.</p>

<p>Though this ancient Indian legend bears a very suspicious resemblance
to the more modern biblical romance, Gaffarel and others attribute
the origin of the latter to the persecutions during the Herodian reign of
the kabalists and the <em>Wise men</em>, who had not remained strictly orthodox.
The latter, as well as the prophets, were nicknamed the “Innocents,” and
the “Babes,” on account of their holiness. As in the case of certain
degrees of modern Masonry, the adepts reckoned their grade of initiation
by a <em>symbolic</em> age. Thus Saul who, when chosen king, was “a
choice and goodly man,” and “from his shoulders upward was higher
than any of the people,” is described in Catholic versions, as “child
of <em>one year</em> when he began to reign,” which, in its literal sense, is a palpable

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>

absurdity. But in <cite>1 Samuel</cite> <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr>, his anointing by Samuel and initiation
are described; and at verse 6th, Samuel uses this significant language:
“... the Spirit of the Lord will come upon thee and thou
shalt prophesy with them, <em>and shalt be turned into another man</em>.” The
phrase above quoted is thus made plain—he had received one
degree of initiation and was symbolically described as “a child one
year old.” The Catholic <cite>Bible</cite>, from which the text is quoted, with
charming candor says in a foot-note: “It is extremely difficult to
explain” (meaning that Saul was a child of one year). But undaunted
by any difficulty the Editor, nevertheless, does take upon himself
to explain it, and adds: “<em>A child of one year.</em> That is, <em>he was
good and like an innocent child</em>.” An interpretation as ingenious as it
is pious; and which if it does no good can certainly do no
 <span class="lock">harm.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_367" id="FNanchor_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>If the explanation of the kabalists is rejected, then the whole subject
falls into confusion; worse still—for it becomes a direct plagiarism
from the Hindu legend. All the commentators have agreed that a litteral
massacre of young children is nowhere mentioned in history; and
that, moreover, an occurrence like that would have made such a bloody
page in Roman annals that the record of it would have been preserved for us
by every author of the day. Herod himself was subject to the Roman
law; and undoubtedly he would have paid the penalty of such a monstrous
crime, with his own life. But if, on the one hand, we have not
the slightest trace of this fable in history, on the other, we find in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">201</a></span>
official complaints of the Synagogue abundant evidence of the persecution
of the initiates. The <cite>Talmud</cite> also corroborates it.</p>

<p>The Jewish version of the birth of Jesus is recorded in the <cite>Sepher-Toldos
Jeshu</cite> in the following words:</p>

<p>“Mary having become the mother of a Son, named Jehosuah, and
the boy growing up, she entrusted him to the care of the Rabbi Elhanan,
and the child progressed in knowledge, for he was well gifted with spirit
and understanding.</p>

<p>“Rabbi Jehosuah, son of Perachiah, continued the education of Jehosuah
(Jesus) after Elhanan, and <em>initiated</em> him in the <em>secret</em> knowledge;”
but the King, Janneus, having given orders to slay all the initiates, Jehosuah
Ben Perachiah, fled to Alexandria, in Egypt, taking the boy with him.</p>

<p>While in Alexandria, continues the story, they were received in the
house of a rich and learned lady (personified Egypt). Young Jesus
found her beautiful, notwithstanding “<em>a defect in her eyes</em>,” and declared
so to his master. Upon hearing this, the latter became so angry that his
pupil should find in the land of bondage anything good, that “he cursed
him and drove the young man from his presence.” Then follow a series
of adventures told in allegorical language, which show that Jesus supplemented
his initiation in the Jewish <cite>Kabala</cite> with an additional acquisition
of the secret wisdom of Egypt. When the persecution ceased, they
both returned to <span class="lock">Judea.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_368" id="FNanchor_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>The real grievances against Jesus are stated by the learned author
of <cite>Tela Ignea Satanæ</cite> (the fiery darts of Satan) to be two in number:
1st, that he had discovered the great Mysteries of their Temple, by
having been initiated in Egypt; and <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr>, that he had profaned them by
exposing them to the vulgar, who misunderstood and disfigured them.
This is what they <span class="lock">say:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_369" id="FNanchor_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>“There exists, in the sanctuary of the living God, a cubical stone, on
which are sculptured the holy characters, the combination of which gives
the explanation of the attributes and powers of the incommunicable
name. This explanation is the secret key of all the occult sciences and
forces in nature. It is what the Hebrews call the <i>Scham hamphorash</i>.
This stone is watched by two lions of gold, who roar as soon as it is
<span class="lock">approached.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_370" id="FNanchor_370">[370]</a></span>
 The gates of the temple were never lost sight of, and the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span>
door of the sanctuary opened but once a year, to admit the High Priest
alone. But Jesus, who had learned in Egypt the ‘great secrets’ at the
initiation, forged for himself invisible keys, and thus was enabled to penetrate
into the sanctuary unseen.... He copied the characters on the
cubical stone, and hid them in his <span class="lock">thigh;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_371" id="FNanchor_371">[371]</a></span>
 after which, emerging from
the temple, he went abroad and began astounding people with his miracles.
The dead were raised at his command, the leprous and the obsessed
were healed. He forced the stones which lay buried for ages at the bottom
of the sea to rise to the surface until they formed a mountain, from
the top of which he preached.” The <cite>Sepher Toldos</cite> states further that,
<em>unable to displace</em> the cubical stone of the sanctuary, Jesus fabricated one
of clay, which he showed to the nations and passed it off for the true
cubical stone of Israel.</p>

<p>This allegory, like the rest of them in such books, is written “<em>inside
and outside</em>”—it has its secret meaning, and ought to be read two ways.
The kabalistic books explain its mystical meaning. Further, the same
Talmudist says, in substance, the following: Jesus was thrown in
 <span class="lock">prison,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_372" id="FNanchor_372">[372]</a></span>
and kept there forty days; then flogged as a seditious rebel; then stoned
as a blasphemer in a place called Lud, and finally allowed to expire upon
a cross. “All this,” explains Levi, “because he revealed to the people
the truths which they (the Pharisees) wished to bury for their own use.
He had divined the occult theology of Israel, had compared it with the
wisdom of Egypt, and found thereby the reason for a universal religious
<span class="lock">synthesis.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_373" id="FNanchor_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>However cautious one ought to be in accepting anything about Jesus
from Jewish sources, it must be confessed that in some things they seem
to be more correct in their statements (whenever their direct interest in
stating facts is not concerned) than our good but too jealous Fathers.
One thing is certain, James, the “Brother of the Lord,” is silent about
the <em>resurrection</em>. He terms Jesus nowhere “Son of God,” nor even
Christ-God. Once only, speaking of Jesus, he calls him the “Lord of
Glory,” but so do the Nazarenes when writing about their prophet <i>Iohanan
bar Zacharia</i>, or John, son of Zacharias (<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
 John Baptist). Their favorite
expressions about their prophet are the same as those used by James
when speaking of Jesus. A man “of the seed of a man,” “Messenger of
Life,” of light, “my Lord Apostle,” “King sprung of Light,” and so on.
“Have not the faith of our <em>Lord</em> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
 Christ, <em>the Lord of Glory</em>” etc.,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
says James in his epistle (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 1), presumably
 addressing Christ as <span class="smcap">God</span>.
“Peace to thee, my <em>Lord</em>, <span class="smcap">John</span> Abo Sabo, Lord of Glory!” says the
<cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite> (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, 19), known to address but a prophet. “Ye have
condemned and killed the <em>Just</em>,” says James (v. 6). “Iohanan (John) is
the <em>Just</em> one, he comes in the way of <em>justice</em>,” says Matthew
 (<abbr title="twenty-one">xxi.</abbr> 32,
Syriac text).</p>

<p>James does not even call Jesus <em>Messiah</em>, in the sense given to the
title by the Christians, but alludes to the kabalistic “King Messiah,”
who is Lord of <span class="lock">Sabaoth<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_374" id="FNanchor_374">[374]</a></span>
 (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 4), and repeats several times that the
“Lord” will come, but identifies the latter nowhere with Jesus. “Be
patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord ... be
patient, for the coming of the Lord <em>draweth nigh</em>” (<abbr title="verses">v.</abbr> 7, 8). And he
adds: “Take, my brethren, the prophet (Jesus) <em>who has spoken in the
name of the Lord</em> for an example of suffering, affliction, and of patience.”
Though in the present version the word “prophet” stands in the plural,
yet this is a deliberate falsification of the original, the purpose of which
is too evident. James, immediately after having cited the “prophets” as
an example, adds: “Behold ... ye have <i>heard</i> of the patience of Job,
and <em>have seen the end</em> of the Lord”—thus combining the examples of
these two admirable characters, and placing them on a perfect equality.
But we have more to adduce in support of our argument. Did not Jesus
himself glorify the prophet of the Jordan? “What went ye out for to
see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophet....
Verily, I say unto you, among them that are born <em>of women</em> there hath
not risen a greater than John the Baptist.”</p>

<p>And of whom was he who spoke thus born? It is but the Roman
Catholics who have changed Mary, the mother of Jesus, into a <em>goddess</em>.
In the eyes of all other Christians she was a woman, whether his own
birth was immaculate or otherwise. According to strict logic, then, Jesus
confessed John <em>greater</em> than himself. Note how completely this matter
is disposed of by the language employed by the Angel Gabriel when
addressing Mary: “Blessed art thou among <em>women</em>.” These words are
unequivocal. He does not adore her as the Mother of God, nor does he
call her <em>goddess</em>; he does not even address her as “Virgin,” but he calls
her <em>woman</em>, and only distinguishes her above other women as having had
better fortune, through her purity.</p>

<p>The Nazarenes were known as Baptists, Sabians, and John’s Christians.
Their belief was that the Messiah was not the Son of God, but simply
a prophet who would follow John. “Johanan, the Son of the Abo
Sabo Zachariah, shall say to himself, ‘Whoever will believe in my <em>justice</em>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>

and my <span class="smcap">Baptism</span> shall be joined to my association; he shall share with
me the seat which is the abode of life, of the supreme Mano, and of living
fire” (<cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>,
 <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 115). Origen remarks “there are some who
said of John (the Baptist) that he was the <em>anointed</em>
 <span class="lock">(Christus).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_375" id="FNanchor_375">[375]</a></span> The
Angel Rasiel of the kabalists is the Angel <i>Gabriel</i> of the Nazarenes, and
it is the latter who is chosen of all the celestial hierarchy by the Christians
to become the messenger of the ‘annunciation.’ The genius sent
by the ‘Lord of Celsitude’ is Æbel Zivo, whose name is also called
<span class="smcap">Gabriel</span> <span class="lock">Legatus.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_376" id="FNanchor_376">[376]</a></span>
 Paul must have had the sect of the Nazarenes in
mind when he said: “And last of all he (Jesus) was seen of me also, as
<em>of one born out of due time</em>” (<cite>1 <abbr title="Corinthians">Corinth.</abbr></cite>,
<abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 8), thus reminding his listeners
of the expression usual to the Nazarenes, who termed the Jews “the
abortions, or born out of time.” Paul prides himself of belonging to a
<span class="lock">hæresy.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_377" id="FNanchor_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>When the metaphysical conceptions of the Gnostics, who saw in Jesus
the Logos and the anointed, began to gain ground, the earliest Christians
separated from the Nazarenes, who accused Jesus of perverting the doctrines
of John, and changing the baptism of the
 <span class="lock">Jordan.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_378" id="FNanchor_378">[378]</a></span>
 “Directly,”
says Milman, “as it (the Gospel) got <em>beyond</em> the borders of Palestine,
and the name of ‘Christ’ had acquired sanctity and veneration in the
Eastern cities, he became a kind of <em>metaphysical impersonation</em>, while the
religion lost its purely moral cast and assumed the character of a <em>speculative</em>
<span class="lock"><em>theogony</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_379" id="FNanchor_379">[379]</a></span>
 The only half-original document that has reached us
from the primitive apostolic days, is the <i>Logia</i> of Matthew. The real,
genuine doctrine has remained in the hands of the Nazarenes, in this
<cite>Gospel of Matthew</cite> containing the “secret doctrine,” the “Sayings of
Jesus,” mentioned by Papias. These sayings were, no doubt, of the same
nature as the small manuscripts placed in the hands of the neophytes,
who were candidates for the Initiations into the Mysteries, and which
contained the <cite>Aporrheta</cite>, the revelations of some important rites and
symbols. For why should Matthew take such precautions to make them
“<em>secret</em>” were it otherwise?</p>

<p>Primitive Christianity had its grip, pass-words, and degrees of initiation.
The innumerable Gnostic gems and amulets are weighty proofs of
it. It is a whole symbolical science. The kabalists were the first to
embellish the universal <span class="lock">Logos,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_380" id="FNanchor_380">[380]</a></span>
 with such terms as “Light of Light,” the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>

Messenger of <span class="smcap">Life</span> and
 <span class="lock"><span class="smcap">Light</span>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_381" id="FNanchor_381">[381]</a></span>
 and we find these expressions adopted
<i lang="la">in toto</i> by the Christians, with the addition of nearly all the Gnostic terms
such as Pleroma (fulness), Archons, Æons, etc. As to the “First-Born,”
the First, and the “Only-Begotten,” these are as old as the world.
Origen shows the word “Logos” as existing among the Brachmanes.
“The <i>Brachmanes</i> say that the God is <em>Light</em>, not such as one sees, nor
such as the sun and fire; but they have the <em>God</em> <span class="smcap">Logos</span>, not the articulate,
the Logos of the Gnosis, through whom the highest <span class="allsmcap">MYSTERIES</span> of
the Gnosis are seen by the <span class="lock">wise.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_382" id="FNanchor_382">[382]</a></span>
 The <cite>Acts</cite> and the fourth <cite>Gospel</cite>
teem with Gnostic expressions. The kabalistic: “God’s first-born
emanated from the Most High,” together with <em>that which is the “Spirit
of the Anointing;”</em> and again “they called him the anointed of the
<span class="lock">Highest,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_383" id="FNanchor_383">[383]</a></span>
 are reproduced in Spirit and substance by the author of the
<cite>Gospel according to John</cite>. “That was <em>the true light</em>,” and “the light
shineth in darkness.” “And the <span class="allsmcap">WORD</span> <em>was made flesh</em>.” “And his
<em>fulness</em> (pleroma) have all we received,” etc. (<cite>John</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> et seq.).</p>

<p>The “Christ,” then, and the “Logos” existed ages before Christianity;
the Oriental Gnosis was studied long before the days of Moses, and
we have to seek for the origin of all these in the archaic periods of the
primeval Asiatic philosophy. Peter’s second <cite>Epistle</cite> and Jude’s fragment,
preserved in the <cite>New Testament</cite>, show by their phraseology that they
belong to the kabalistic Oriental Gnosis, for they use the same expressions
as did the Christian Gnostics who built a part of their system from
the Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>. “Presumptuous are they (the Ophites), self-willed,
they are not afraid to speak evil of <span class="smcap">Dignities</span>,”
 says Peter (<abbr title="second">2d</abbr> Epistle
<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 10), the original model for the later abusive
 Tertullian and <span class="lock">Irenæus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_384" id="FNanchor_384">[384]</a></span>
“Likewise (even as Sodom and Gomorrah) also these <em>filthy</em> dreamers
defile the flesh, despise <span class="smcap">Dominion</span> and speak evil of <span class="smcap">Dignities</span>,” says
Jude, repeating the very words of Peter, and thereby expressions consecrated
in the <cite>Kabala</cite>. <em>Dominion</em> is the “Empire,” the <em>tenth</em> of the
kabalistic <span class="lock">sephiroth.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_385" id="FNanchor_385">[385]</a></span>
 The <em>Powers</em> and Dignities are the subordinate

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>

genii of the Archangels and Angels of the
<span class="lock"><cite>Sohar</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_386" id="FNanchor_386">[386]</a></span>
These emanations
are the very life and soul of the <cite>Kabala</cite> and Zoroastranism; and
the <cite>Talmud</cite> itself, in its present state, is all borrowed from the <cite>Zend-avesta</cite>.
Therefore, by adopting the views of Peter, Jude, and other Jewish
apostles, the Christians have become but a dissenting sect of the Persians,
for they do not even interpret the meaning of all such <em>Powers</em> as
the true kabalists do. Paul’s warning his converts against the worshipping
of angels, shows how well he appreciated, even so early as his period,
the dangers of borrowing from a metaphysical doctrine the philosophy of
which could be rightly interpreted but by its well-learned adherents, the
Magi and the Jewish Tanaïm. “Let no man beguile you of your reward
in a voluntary humility and <em>worshipping of angels</em>, intruding into those
things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly
<span class="lock">mind,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_387" id="FNanchor_387">[387]</a></span> is
a sentence laid right at the door of Peter and his champions. In the
<cite>Talmud</cite>, Michael is Prince of Water, who has <em>seven</em> inferior spirits subordinate
to him. He is the patron, the guardian angel of the Jews, as
Daniel informs us (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 21), and the Greek Ophites, who identified him with
their Ophiomorphos, the personified creation of the envy and malice of
Ilda-Baoth, the Demiurgus (Creator of the <em>material</em> world), and undertook
to prove that he was also Samuel, the Hebrew prince of the evil
spirits, or Persian devs, were naturally regarded by the Jews as blasphemers.
But did Jesus ever sanction this belief in angels except in so
far as hinting that they were the messengers and subordinates of God?
And here the origin of the later splits between Christian beliefs is directly
traceable to these two early contradictory views.</p>

<p>Paul, believing in all such occult powers in the world “unseen,” but
ever “present,” says: “Ye walked according to the <span class="smcap">Æon</span> of this world,
according to the <i>Archon</i> (Ilda-Baoth, the <i>Demiurg</i>) that has the domination
of the air,” and “We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
against the <i>dominations</i>, the <i>powers</i>; the lords of darkness, the mischievousness
of spirits in the upper regions.” This sentence, “Ye were dead
in sin and error,” for “ye walked according to the <cite>Archon</cite>,” or Ilda-Baoth,
the God and creator of matter of the Ophites, shows unequivocally
that: 1st, Paul, notwithstanding some dissensions with the more important
doctrines of the Gnostics, shared more or less their cosmogonical views
on the emanations; and <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr>, that he was fully aware that this Demiurge,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>

whose Jewish name was Jehovah, was <em>not</em> the God preached by Jesus.
And now, if we compare the doctrine of Paul with the religious views of
Peter and Jude, we find that, not only did they worship Michael, the
Archangel, but that also they <em>reverenced</em> <span class="smcap">Satan</span>, because the latter was
also, before his fall, an angel! This they do quite openly, and abuse the
<span class="lock">Gnostics<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_388" id="FNanchor_388">[388]</a></span>
 for speaking “evil” of him. No one can deny the following:
Peter, when denouncing those who are not afraid to speak evil of “<em>dignities</em>,”
adds immediately, “Whereas angels, which are greater in power
and might, <em>bring not railing accusations</em> against them (the dignities)
before the Lord” (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 11). Who are the dignities? Jude, in his general
epistle, makes the word as clear as day. The <em>dignities</em> are the <span class="allsmcap">DEVILS</span>!!
Complaining of the disrespect shown by the Gnostics to the <em>powers</em> and
<em>dominions</em>, Jude argues in the very words of Peter: “And yet, Michael,
the Archangel, when contending <em>with the devil</em>, he disputed about the
body of Moses, <em>durst not bring against him a railing accusation</em>, but said,
The Lord rebuke thee” (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 9). Is this plain enough? If not, then we
have the <cite>Kabala</cite> to prove who were the <em>dignities</em>.</p>

<p>Considering that <cite>Deuteronomy</cite> tells us that the “<em>Lord</em>” Himself
buried Moses in a valley of Moab (<abbr title="thirty-four">xxxiv.</abbr> 6), “and no man knoweth of
his sepulchre unto this day,” this biblical <i lang="la">lapsus linguæ</i> of Jude gives a
strong coloring to the assertions of some of the Gnostics. They claimed
but what was secretly taught by the Jewish kabalists themselves; to
wit: that the highest supreme God was unknown and invisible; “the
King of Light is a closed eye;” that Ilda-Baoth, the Jewish second Adam,
was the real Demiurge; and that Iao, Adonai, Sabaoth, and Eloi were
the quaternary emanation which formed the unity of the God of the Hebrews—Jehovah.
Moreover, the latter was also called Michael and
Samael by them, and regarded but as an angel, several removes from the
Godhead. In holding to such a belief, the Gnostics countenanced the
teachings of the greatest of the Jewish doctors, Hillel, and other Babylonian
divines. Josephus shows the great deference of the official Synagogue
in Jerusalem to the wisdom of the schools of Central Asia. The colleges
of Sora, Pumbiditha, and Nahaidea were considered the headquarters of
esoteric and theological learning by all the schools of Palestine. The
Chaldean version of the <cite>Pentateuch</cite>, made by the well-known Babylonian
divine, Onkelos, was regarded as the most authoritative of all; and it is
according to this learned Rabbi that Hillel and other Tanaïm after him
held that the Being who appeared to Moses in the burning bush, on
Mount Sinai, and who finally buried him, was the <em>angel</em> of the Lord,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>

Memro, and not the Lord Himself; and that he whom the Hebrews of the
<cite>Old Testament</cite> mistook for <i>Iahoh</i> was but His messenger, one of His sons,
or emanations. All this establishes but one logical conclusion—namely,
that the Gnostics were by far the superiors of the disciples, in point of
education and general information; even in a knowledge of the religious
tenets of the Jews themselves. While they were perfectly well-versed in
the Chaldean wisdom, the well-meaning, pious, but fanatical as well as
ignorant disciples, unable to fully understand or grasp the religious spirit
of their own system, were driven in their disputations to such convincing
logic as the use of “brute beasts,” “sows,” “dogs,” and other epithets
so freely bestowed by Peter.</p>

<p>Since then, the epidemic has reached the apex of the sacerdotal hierarchy.
From the day when the founder of Christianity uttered the warning,
that he who shall say to his brother, “Thou fool, shall be in danger
of hell-fire,” all who have passed as its leaders, beginning with the ragged
fishermen of Galilee, and ending with the jewelled pontiffs, have seemed
to vie with each other in the invention of opprobrious epithets for their
opponents. So we find Luther passing a final sentence on the Catholics,
and exclaiming that “The Papists are all asses, put them in whatever
form you like; whether they are boiled, roasted, baked, fried, skinned,
hashed, they will be always the same asses.” Calvin called the victims
he persecuted, and occasionally burned, “malicious barking dogs, full of
bestiality and insolence, base corrupters of the sacred writings,” etc.
Dr. Warburton terms the Popish religion “an impious farce,” and Monseigneur
Dupanloup asserts that the Protestant Sabbath service is the
“Devil’s mass,” and all clergymen are “thieves and ministers of the
Devil.”</p>

<p>The same spirit of incomplete inquiry and ignorance has led the
Christian Church to bestow on its most holy apostles, titles assumed by
their most desperate opponents, the “Hæretics” and Gnostics. So we
find, for instance, Paul termed the vase of election “<i lang="la">Vas Electionis</i>,” a
title chosen by <span class="lock"><cite>Manes</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_389" id="FNanchor_389">[389]</a></span>
 the greatest heretic of his day in the eyes of the
Church, Manes meaning, in the Babylonian language, the chosen vessel
or <span class="lock">receptacle.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_390" id="FNanchor_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>So with the Virgin Mary. They were so little gifted with originality,
that they copied from the Egyptian and Hindu religions their several

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>

apostrophes to their respective Virgin-mothers. The juxtaposition of a
few examples will make this clear.</p>

If the Virgin Mary has her nuns, who are consecrated to her and
bound to live in chastity, so had Isis her nuns in Egypt, as Vesta had
hers at Rome, and the Hindu Nari, “mother of the world hers.” The
virgins consecrated to her cultus—the Devadasi of the temples, who
were the nuns of the days of old—lived in great chastity, and were
objects of the most extraordinary veneration, as the holy women of the
goddess. Would the missionaries and some travellers reproachfully point
to the modern Devadasis, or Nautch-girls? For all response, we would
beg them to consult the official reports of the last quarter century, cited
in chapter <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, as to certain discoveries made at the razing of convents,
in Austria and Italy. Thousands of infants’ skulls were exhumed from
ponds, subterranean vaults, and gardens of convents. Nothing to match
<em>this</em> was ever found in heathen lands.</p>

<p>Christian theology, getting the doctrine of the archangels and angels
directly from the Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>, of which the Mosaic <cite>Bible</cite> is but an
allegorical screen, ought at least to remember the hierarchy invented by
the former for these personified emanations. The hosts of the Cherubim
and Seraphim, with which we generally see the Catholic Madonnas surrounded
in their pictures, belong, together with the Elohim and Beni
Elohim of the Hebrews, to the <em>third</em> kabalistic world, <i>Jezirah</i>. This
world is but one remove higher than <i>Asiah</i>, the fourth and lowest world,
in which dwell the grossest and most material beings—the <i>klippoth</i>, who
delight in evil and mischief, and whose chief is <i>Belial</i>!</p>

<p>Explaining, in his way, of course, the various “heresies” of the first
two centuries, Irenæus says: “Our Hæretics hold ... that <span class="smcap">Propator</span>
is known but to the <em>only-begotten</em> son, that is to the <em>mind</em>” (the nous).
It was the Valentinians, the followers of the “profoundest doctor of the
Gnosis,” Valentinus, who held that “there was a perfect <span class="smcap">Aiôn</span>, who
existed before Bythos, or Buthon (the Depth), called Propator.” This is
again kabalistic, for in the <cite>Sohar</cite> of Simon Ben Iochaï, we read the following:
“<cite lang="la">Senior occultatus est et absconditus; Microprosopus manifestus
est, et non manifestus</cite>” (Rosenroth: <cite>The Sohar Liber Mysteries</cite>, <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr>, 1).</p>

<p>In the religious metaphysics of the Hebrews, the Highest One is an
abstraction; he is “without form or being,” “with no likeness with anything
<span class="lock">else.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_391" id="FNanchor_391">[391]</a></span>
 And even Philo calls the Creator, the <i>Logos</i> who stands
next God, “the <span class="allsmcap">SECOND</span> God.” “The
 <em>second</em> God who is his
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">WISDOM</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_392" id="FNanchor_392">[392]</a></span>
God is <span class="allsmcap">NOTHING</span>, he is nameless, and therefore called <i>Ain-Soph</i>—the word
<i>Ain</i> meaning <span class="lock"><i>nothing</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_393" id="FNanchor_393">[393]</a></span>
 But if, according to the older Jews, Jehovah is
<i>the</i> God, and He manifested Himself several times to Moses and the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span>

prophets, and the Christian Church anathematized the Gnostics who denied
the fact—how comes it, then, that we read in the fourth gospel that “<em>No
man hath seen God</em> <span class="allsmcap">AT ANY TIME</span>, but the
 <em>only-begotten</em> Son ... he hath
declared him?” The very words of the Gnostics, in spirit and substance.
This sentence of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John—or rather whoever wrote the gospel now
bearing his name—floors all the Petrine arguments against Simon Magus,
without appeal. The words are repeated and emphasized in chapter <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr>:
“<em>Not that any man hath seen the Father</em>, save he which is of God, he
(Jesus) hath seen the Father” (46)—the very objection brought forward
by Simon in the <cite>Homilies</cite>. These words prove that either the author of
the fourth evangel had no idea of the existence of the <cite>Homilies</cite>, or that
he was <i>not</i> John, the friend and companion of Peter, whom he contradicts
point-blank with this emphatic assertion. Be it as it may, this sentence,
like many more that might be profitably cited, blends Christianity completely
with the Oriental Gnosis, and hence with the <span class="allsmcap">KABALA</span>.</p>

<p>While the doctrines, ethical code, and observances of the Christian
religion were all appropriated from Brahmanism and Buddhism, its ceremonials,
vestments, and pageantry were taken bodily from Lamaism.
The Romish monastery and nunnery are almost servile copies of similar
religious houses in Thibet and Mongolia, and interested explorers of Buddhist
lands, when obliged to mention the unwelcome fact, have had no
other alternative left them but, with an anachronism unsurpassed in recklessness,
to charge the offense of plagiarism upon the religious system
their own mother Church had despoiled. This makeshift has served its
purpose and had its day. The time has at last come when this page of
history must be written.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> will now give attention to some of the most important Mysteries
of the <cite>Kabala</cite>, and trace their relations to the philosophical
myths of various nations.</p>

<p>In the oldest Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>, the Deity is represented as three circles
in one, shrouded in a certain smoke or chaotic exhalation. In the
preface to the <cite>Sohar</cite>, which transforms the three primordial circles into
<span class="smcap">Three Heads</span>, over these is described an exhalation or smoke, neither
black nor white, but colorless, and circumscribed within a circle. This
is the unknown <span class="lock">Essence.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_394" id="FNanchor_394">[394]</a></span>
 The origin of the Jewish image may, perhaps,
be traced to Hermes’ <i>Pimander</i>, the Egyptian <i>Logos</i>, who appears within
a cloud of a humid nature, with a smoke escaping from
 <span class="lock">it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_395" id="FNanchor_395">[395]</a></span>
 In the <cite>Sohar</cite>
the highest God is, as we have shown in the preceding chapter, and as
in the case of the Hindu and Buddhist philosophies, a pure abstraction,
whose objective existence is denied by the latter. It is Hakama, the
“<span class="smcap">Supreme Wisdom</span>, that cannot be understood by reflection,” and that
lies within and without the <span class="smcap">Cranium</span> of <span class="smcap">Long</span>
 <span class="lock"><span class="smcap">Face</span><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_396" id="FNanchor_396">[396]</a></span>
 (Sephira), the
uppermost of the three “Heads.” It is the “boundless and the infinite
En-Soph,” the No-Thing.</p>

<p>The “three Heads,” superposed above each other, are evidently taken
from the three mystic triangles of the Hindus, which also superpose each
other. The highest “head” contains the <i>Trinity in Chaos</i>, out of which
springs the manifested trinity. En-Soph, the unrevealed forever, who is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>

boundless and unconditioned, cannot create, and
therefore it seems to us a great error to attribute to him a
“creative thought,” as is commonly done by the interpreters. In every
cosmogony this supreme Essence is <em>passive</em>; if boundless, infinite,
and unconditioned, it can have no <em>thought</em> nor <em>idea</em>. It acts not
as the result of volition, but in obedience to its own nature,
and <em>according to the fatality of the law of which it is itself
the embodiment</em>. Thus, with the Hebrew kabalists, En-Soph is
non-existent עַיִן, for it is incomprehensible to our finite intellects,
and therefore cannot exist to our minds. Its first emanation was
Sephira, the crown כתר. <a id="hebrew3"></a> When the time for an active period had
come, then was produced a natural expansion of this Divine
essence from within outwardly, obedient to eternal and immutable
law; and from this eternal and infinite light (which to us is
darkness) was emitted a spiritual
 <span class="lock">substance.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_397" id="FNanchor_397">[397]</a></span>
 This was the
First Sephiroth, containing in herself the other nine ספירות Sephiroth,
or intelligences. In their totality and unity they represent the
archetypal man, Adam Kadmon, the πρωτόγονος, who in
his individuality or unity is yet dual, or bisexual, the Greek
<em>Didumos</em>, for he is the prototype of all humanity. Thus we
obtain three trinities, each contained in a “head.” In the first
head, or face (the three-faced Hindu Trimurti), we find
<em>Sephira</em>, the first androgyne, at the apex of the upper
triangle, emitting <em>Hackama</em>, or Wisdom, a masculine and active
potency—also called Jah, יה—and <em>Binah</em>, בינה, or Intelligence, a
female and passive potency, also represented by the name Jehovah יהוה.
These three form the first trinity or “face” of the Sephiroth. This
triad emanated <em>Hesed</em>, חסד, or Mercy, a masculine active potency,
also called <em>El</em>, from which emanated <em>Geburah</em> דין, or Justice, also
called Eloha, a feminine passive potency; from the
union of these two was produced Tiphereth תפארת, <a id="hebrew4"></a> Beauty, Clemency,
the Spiritual Sun, known by the divine name <em>Elohim</em>; and
the second triad, “face,” or “head,” was formed. These emanating, in
their turn, the masculine potency <em>Netzah</em>, נצח, Firmness, or
Jehovah Sabaoth, who issued the feminine passive potency <em>Hod</em>, הוד, Splendor,
or Elohim Sabaoth; the two produced <em>Jesod</em>, יסוד, Foundation, who is
the mighty living one <em>El-Chai</em>, thus yielding the third trinity or
“head.” The tenth Sephiroth is rather a duad, and is represented on
the diagrams as the lowest circle. It is Malchuth or Kingdom, מלכות, and
Shekinah שכינה, <a id="hebrew5"></a> also called Adonai, and <em>Cherubim</em> among the angelic
hosts. The first “Head” is called the Intellectual world; the second
“Head” is the Sensuous, or the world of Perception, and the third is
the Material or Physical world.</p>

<p>“Before he gave any shape to the universe,” says the <cite>Kabala</cite>, “before

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>

he produced any form, he was alone without any form and resemblance
to anything else. Who, then, can comprehend him, how he was before
the creation, since he was formless? Hence, it is forbidden to represent
him by any form, similitude, or even by his sacred name, by a single
letter, or a single point.... The Aged of the Aged, the Unknown of
the Unknown, has a form, and yet no form. He has a form whereby the
universe is preserved, and yet has no form, because he cannot be comprehended.
When he first assumed a form (in Sephira, his first emanation),
he caused nine splendid lights to emanate from
<span class="lock">it.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_398" id="FNanchor_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we will turn to the Hindu esoteric Cosmogony and definition
of “Him who is, and yet is not.”</p>

<p>“From him who <span class="lock">is,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_399" id="FNanchor_399">[399]</a></span>
 from this immortal Principle which exists in our
minds but cannot be perceived by the senses, is born Purusha, the
Divine male and female, who became <i>Narayana</i>, or the Divine Spirit
moving on the water.”</p>

<p>Swayambhuva, the unknown essence of the Brahmans, is identical with
En-Soph, the unknown essence of the kabalists. As with the latter, the
ineffable name could not be pronounced by the Hindus, under the penalty
of death. In the ancient primitive trinity of India, that which may
be certainly considered as pre-Vedic, the <em>germ</em> which fecundates the
<em>mother-principle</em>, the mundane egg, or the universal womb, is called <i>Nara</i>,
the Spirit, or the Holy Ghost, which emanates from the primordial essence.
It is like Sephira, the oldest emanation, called the <i>primordial point</i>, and the
<i>White Head</i>, for it is the point of divine light appearing from within the
fathomless and boundless darkness. In <cite>Manu</cite> it is “<span class="smcap">Nara</span>, or the Spirit
of God, which moves on Ayana (Chaos, or place of motion), and is called
<span class="smcap">Narayana</span>, or moving on the
 <span class="lock">waters.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_400" id="FNanchor_400">[400]</a></span>
 In Hermes, the Egyptian, we
read: “In the beginning of the time there was naught in the chaos.”
But when the “<em lang="la">verbum</em>,” issuing from the void like a “colorless smoke,”
makes its appearance, then “this verbum moved on the humid
<span class="lock">principle.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_401" id="FNanchor_401">[401]</a></span>
And in <cite>Genesis</cite> we find: “And darkness was upon the face
of the deep (chaos). And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.” In the <cite>Kabala</cite>, the emanation of the primordial passive principle
(Sephira), by dividing itself into two parts, active and passive, emits
Chochma-Wisdom and Binah-Jehovah, and in conjunction with these two
acolytes, which complete the trinity, becomes the Creator of the abstract
Universe; the physical world being the production of later and still
more material <span class="lock">powers.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_402" id="FNanchor_402">[402]</a></span>
 In the Hindu Cosmogony, Swayambhuva emits

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">215</a></span>

Nara and Nari, its bisexual emanation, and dividing its parts into two
halves, male and female, these fecundate the mundane egg, within which
develops Brahma, or rather Viradj, the Creator. “The starting-point of
the Egyptian mythology,” says Champollion, “is a triad ... namely,
Kneph, Neith, and Phtah; and Ammon, the male, the father; Muth, the
female and mother; and Khons, the son.”</p>

<p>The ten Sephiroth are copies taken from the ten Prâdjapatis created
by Viradj, called the “Lords of all beings,” and answering to the biblical
Patriarchs.</p>

<p>Justin Martyr explains some of the “heresies” of the day, but in a
very unsatisfactory manner. <em>He shows, however, the identity of all the
world-religions at their starting-points.</em> The first <em>beginning</em> opens invariably
with the <em>unknown</em> and passive deity, producing from himself a certain

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>

active power or virtue, “Rational,” which is sometimes called
<span class="smcap">Wisdom</span>, sometimes the <span class="smcap">Son</span>,
very often God, Angel, Lord, and <span class="lock"><span class="smcap">Logos</span>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_403" id="FNanchor_403">[403]</a></span>
The latter is sometimes applied to the very first emanation, but in several
systems it proceeds from the first androgyne or double ray produced at
the beginning by the unseen. Philo depicts this wisdom as male and
female. But though its first manifestation had a beginning, for it proceeded
from <span class="lock"><i>Oulom</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_404" id="FNanchor_404">[404]</a></span>
 (Aiôn, time), the highest of the Æons, when emitted
from the Fathers, it had remained with him <em>before all creations</em>, for it is
part of <span class="lock">him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_405" id="FNanchor_405">[405]</a></span>
 Therefore, Philo Judæus calls Adam Kadmon “<i>mind</i>”
(the Ennoia of <i>Bythos</i> in the Gnostic system). “The mind, let it be
named <span class="lock">Adam.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_406" id="FNanchor_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, it is difficult to view the Jewish <cite>Book of Genesis</cite>
otherwise than as a chip from the trunk of the mundane tree of universal
Cosmogony, rendered in Oriental allegories. As cycle succeeded cycle,
and one nation after another came upon the world’s stage to play its brief
part in the majestic drama of human life, each new people evolved from
ancestral traditions its own religion, giving it a local color, and stamping
it with its individual characteristics. While each of these religions had
its distinguishing traits, by which, were there no other archaic vestiges,
the physical and psychological status of its creators could be estimated,
all preserved a common likeness to one prototype. This parent cult was
none other than the primitive “wisdom-religion.” The Israelitish <cite>Scriptures</cite>
are no exception. Their national history—if they can claim any
autonomy before the return from Babylon, and were anything more than
migratory septs of Hindu pariahs, cannot be carried back a day beyond
Moses; and if this ex-Egyptian priest must, from theological necessity, be
transformed into a Hebrew patriarch, we must insist that the Jewish nation
was lifted with that smiling infant out of the bulrushes of Lake Moeris.
Abraham, their alleged father, belongs to the universal mythology. Most
likely he is but one of the numerous aliases of <i>Zeruan</i> (Saturn), the king
of the golden age, who is also called the old man (emblem of
<span class="lock">time).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_407" id="FNanchor_407">[407]</a></span></p>

<p>It is now demonstrated by Assyriologists that in the old Chaldean
books Abraham is called Zeru-an, or Zerb-an—meaning one very rich in
gold and silver, and a mighty
 <span class="lock">prince.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_408" id="FNanchor_408">[408]</a></span>
 He is also called Zarouan and
Zarman—a decrepit old
 <span class="lock">man.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_409" id="FNanchor_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>

The ancient Babylonian legend is that Xisuthrus (Hasisadra of the
Tablets, or Xisuthrus) sailed with his ark to Armenia, and his son Sim
became supreme king. Pliny says that Sim was called Zeruan; and
Sim is Shem. In Hebrew, his name writes שם, <a id="hebrew6"></a><i>Shem</i>—a sign. Assyria
is held by the ethnologists to be the land of Shem, and Egypt called
that of Ham. Shem, in the tenth chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite> is made the father
of all the children of Eber, of Elam (Oulam or Eilam), and Ashur (Assur
or Assyria). The “<i>nephelim</i>,” or fallen men, <i>Gebers</i>, mighty men spoken
of in <cite>Genesis</cite> (<abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 4), come from <i>Oulam</i>, “men of <i>Shem</i>.” Even Ophir,
which is evidently to be sought for in the India of the days of Hiram, is
made a descendant of Shem. The records are purposely mixed up to
make them fit into the frame of the Mosaic <cite>Bible</cite>. But <cite>Genesis</cite>, from its
first verse down to the last, has naught to do with the “chosen people;”
it belongs to the world’s history. Its appropriation by the Jewish authors
in the days of the so-called <em>restoration</em> of the destroyed books of the Israelites,
by Ezra, proves nothing, and, until now, has been self-propped
on an alleged divine revelation. It is simply a compilation of the universal
legends of the universal humanity. Bunsen says that in the
“Chaldean tribe immediately connected with Abraham, we find reminiscences
of dates disfigured and misunderstood, as genealogies of single
men, or indications of epochs. The Abrahamic recollections go back at
least three millenia beyond the grandfather of
 <span class="lock">Jacob.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_410" id="FNanchor_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>Alexander Polyhistor says that Abraham was born at Kamarina or
<i>Uria</i>, a city of soothsayers, and <em>invented astronomy</em>. Josephus claims
the same for Terah, Abraham’s father. The tower of Babel was built as
much by the direct descendants of Shem as by those of the “accursed”
Ham and Canaan, for the people in those days were “one,” and the
“whole earth was of one language;” and Babel was simply an astrological
tower, and its builders were astrologers and adepts of the primitive
Wisdom-Religion, or, again, what we term Secret Doctrine.</p>

<p>The Berosian Sybil says: Before the Tower, Zeru-an, Titan, and
Yapetosthe governed the earth, Zeru-an wished to be supreme, but his
two brothers resisted, when their sister, Astlik, intervened and appeased
them. It was agreed that Zeru-an should rule, but his male children
should be put to death; and strong Titans were appointed to carry this
into effect.</p>

<p>Sar (circle, saros) is the Babylonian god of the sky. He is also
Assaros or Asshur (the son of Shem), and Zero—Zero-ana, the chakkra,
or wheel, boundless time. Hence, as the first step taken by Zoroaster,
while founding his new religion, was to change the most sacred deities

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>

of the Sanscrit <cite>Veda</cite> into names of evil spirits, in his Zend <cite>Scriptures</cite>,
and even to reject a number of them, we find no traces in the <cite>Avesta</cite> of
Chakkra—the symbolic circle of the sky.</p>

<p>Elam, another of the sons of Shem, is <i>Oulam</i> עולם, <a id="hebrew7"></a>and refers to an
order or cycle of events. In <cite>Ecclesiastes</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 11, it is termed “world.”
In <cite>Ezekiel</cite> <abbr title="twenty-six">xxvi.</abbr> 20, “of old time.” In <cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 22, the word stands
as “forever;” and in chapter <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 16, “eternal.” Finally, the term is
completely defined in <cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 4, in the following words: “There were
<i>nephelim</i> (giants, fallen men, or Titans) on the earth.” The word is
synonymous with Æon, αιων. In <cite>Proverbs</cite> <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 23, it reads: “I was
effused from <i>Oulam</i>, from <i>Ras</i>” (wisdom). By this sentence, the
wise king-kabalist refers to one of the mysteries of the human spirit—the
immortal crown of the man-trinity. While it ought to read as above, and
be interpreted kabalistically to mean that the <em>I</em> (or my eternal, immortal
<i lang="la">Ego</i>), the spiritual entity, was effused from the boundless and nameless
eternity, through the creative wisdom of the unknown God, it reads in the
canonical translation: “The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his
way, before his works of old!” which is unintelligible nonsense, without
the kabalistic interpretation. When Solomon is made to say that <em>I</em> was
“from the beginning ... while, as yet, he (the Supreme Deity) had not
made the earth nor the highest part of the dust of the world ... I was
there,” and “when he appointed the foundations of the earth ... then
I was by him, <em>as one brought up with him</em>,” what can the kabalist mean
by the “<em>I</em>,” but his own divine spirit, a drop effused from that eternal
fountain of light and wisdom—the universal spirit of the Deity?</p>

<p>The thread of glory emitted by En-Soph from the highest of the three
kabalistic heads, through which “all things shine with light,” the thread
which makes its exit through Adam <i>Primus</i>, is the individual spirit of
every man. “I was daily his (En-Soph’s) delight, rejoicing always before
him ... and my delights were <em>with the sons of men</em>,” adds Solomon,
in the same chapter of the <cite>Proverbs</cite>. The immortal spirit delights
in the <em>sons of men</em>, who, without this spirit, are but dualities (physical
body and astral soul, or that <em>life-principle</em> which animates even the lowest
of the animal kingdom). But, we have seen that the doctrine teaches
that this spirit cannot unite itself with that man in whom matter and the
grossest propensities of his animal soul will be ever crowding it out.
Therefore, Solomon, who is made to speak under the inspiration of his
own spirit, that possesses him for the time being, utters the following
words of wisdom: “Hearken unto me, my son” (the dual man),
“blessed are they who keep my ways.... Blessed is the man that
heareth me, watching daily at my gates.... For whoso <em>findeth me,
findeth life</em>, and shall obtain favor of the Lord.... But he that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>

sinneth <em>against me</em> wrongeth his <em>own soul</em> ... and loves <em>death</em>” (<cite>Proverbs</cite>
<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 1-36).</p>

<p>This chapter, as interpreted, is made by some theologians, like everything
else, to apply to Christ, the “Son of God,” who states repeatedly,
that he who follows him obtains eternal life, and conquers death. But
even in its distorted translation it can be demonstrated that it referred to
anything but to the alleged Saviour. Were we to accept it in this sense,
then, the Christian theology would have to return, <i lang="la">nolens volens</i>, to
Averroism and Buddhism; to the doctrine of emanation, in short; for
Solomon says: “I was effused” from Oulam and Rasit, both of which
are a part of the Deity; and thus Christ would not be as their doctrine
claims, God himself, but only an <em>emanation</em> of Him, like the Christos of
the Gnostics. Hence, the meaning of the personified Gnostic Æon,
the word signifying cycles or determined periods in the eternity and at
the same time, representing a hierarchy of celestial beings—spirits.
Thus Christ is sometimes termed the “Eternal Æon.” But the word
“eternal” is erroneous in relation to the Æons. Eternal is that which
has neither beginning nor end; but the “Emanations” or Æons, although
having lived as absorbed in the divine essence from the eternity, when
once individually emanated, must be said to have a beginning. They may
be therefore <em>endless</em> in this spiritual life, never eternal.</p>

<p>These endless emanations of the one First Cause, all of which were
gradually transformed by the popular fancy into distinct gods, spirits,
angels, and demons, were so little considered immortal, that all were
assigned a limited existence. And this belief, common to all the peoples
of antiquity, to the Chaldean Magi as well as to the Egyptians, and even
in our day held by the Brahmanists and Buddhists, most triumphantly
evidences the monotheism of the ancient religious systems. This doctrine
calls the life-period of all the inferior divinities, “one day of Parabrahma.”
After a cycle of fourteen milliards, three hundred and twenty-millions
of human years—the tradition says—the trinity itself, with all the
lesser divinities, will be annihilated, together with the universe, and cease
to exist. Then another universe will gradually emerge from the pralaya
(dissolution), and men on earth will be enabled to comprehend
<span class="smcap">Swayambhuva</span> as he is. Alone, this primal cause will exist forever, in
all his glory, filling the infinite space. What better proof could be adduced
of the deep reverential feeling with which the “heathen” regard the one
Supreme eternal cause of all things visible and invisible.</p>

<p>This is again the source from which the ancient kabalists derived
identical doctrines. If the Christians understood <cite>Genesis</cite> in their own
way, and, if accepting the texts literally, they enforced upon the uneducated
masses the belief in a creation of our world out of nothing; and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>

moreover assigned to it a <em>beginning</em>, it is surely not the Tanaïm, the sole
expounders of the hidden meaning contained in the <cite>Bible</cite>, who are to be
blamed. No more than any other philosophers had they ever believed
either in spontaneous, limited, or <i lang="la">ex nihilo</i> creations. The <cite>Kabala</cite> has
survived to show that their philosophy was precisely that of the modern
Nepäl Buddhists, the Svâbhâvikas. They believed <em>in the eternity and
the indestructibility of matter</em>, and hence in many prior creations and
destructions of worlds, before our own. “There were old worlds
which <span class="lock">perished.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_411" id="FNanchor_411">[411]</a></span>
 “From this we see that the Holy One, blessed be
His name, had successively created and destroyed sundry worlds, before
he created the present world; and when he created this world he said:
‘This pleases me; the previous ones did not please
 <span class="lock">me.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_412" id="FNanchor_412">[412]</a></span> Moreover,
they believed, again like the Svâbhâvikas, now termed Atheists, that every
thing proceeds (is created) from its own nature and that once that the
first impulse is given by that Creative Force inherent in the “Self-created
substance,” or Sephira, everything evolves out of itself, following
its pattern, the more spiritual prototype which precedes it in the scale of
infinite creation. “The indivisible point which has no limit, and cannot
be comprehended (for it is absolute), expanded from within, and formed
a brightness which served as a garment (a veil) to the indivisible points....
It, too, expanded from within.... Thus, <em>everything originated
through</em> a constant upheaving agitation, and thus finally the world
<span class="lock">originated.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_413" id="FNanchor_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>In the later Zoroastrian books, after that Darius had restored both
the worship of Ormazd and added to it the purer magianism of the primitive
<i>Secret Wisdom</i>—חכמות־נסתרה,<a id="hebrew8"></a> of which, as the inscription tells us,
he was himself a hierophant, we see again reappearing the Zeru-ana, or
boundless time, represented by the Brahmans in the <i>chakkra</i>, or a circle;
that we see figuring on the uplifted finger of the principal deities.
Further on, we will show the relation in which it stands to the Pythagorean,
mystical numbers—the first and the last—which is a <em>zero</em> (0),
and to the greatest of the Mystery-Gods IAO. The identity of this
symbol alone, in all the old religions, is sufficient to show their common
descent from one primitive
 <span class="lock">Faith.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_414" id="FNanchor_414">[414]</a></span>
 This term of “boundless time,”
which can be applied but to the <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> who has neither beginning nor end, is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>

called by the Zoroastrians Zeruana-Akarene, because he has always existed.
“His glory,” they say, is too exalted, his light too resplendent for either
human intellect or mortal eyes to grasp and see. His primal emanation
is eternal light which, from having been previously concealed in
darkness, was called out to manifest itself, and thus was formed Ormazd,
“the King of Life.” He is the first-born of boundless time, but like his
own antitype, or preëxisting spiritual idea, has lived within primitive
darkness from all eternity. His <i>Logos</i> created the pure intellectual
world. After the lapse of three grand
 <span class="lock">cycles<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_415" id="FNanchor_415">[415]</a></span>
 he created the material
world in six periods. The six Amshaspands, or <i>primitive</i> spiritual men,
whom Ormazd created in his own image, are the mediators between this
world and himself. Mithras is an emanation of the Logos and the chief
of the twenty-eight <i>izeds</i>, who are the tutelary angels over the spiritual
portion of mankind—the souls of men. The <i>Ferouers</i> are infinite in
number. They are the ideas or rather the ideal conceptions of things
which formed themselves in the mind of Ormazd or Ahuramazda before
he willed them to assume a concrete form. They are what Aristotle
terms “privations” of forms and substances. The religion of Zarathustra,
as he is always called in the <cite>Avesta</cite>, is one from which the ancient
Jews have the most borrowed. In one of the Yashts, Ahuramazda, the
Supreme, gives to the seer as one of his sacred names, <i>Ahmi</i>, “I am;”
and in another place, <cite>ahmi yat ahmi</cite>, “I am that I am,” as Jehovah is
alleged to have given it to Moses.</p>

<p>This Cosmogony, adopted with a change of names in the Rabbinical
<cite>Kabala</cite>, found its way, later, with some additional speculations of Manes,
the half-Magus, half-Platonist, into the great body of Gnosticism. The
real doctrines of the Basilideans, Valentinians, and the Marcionites cannot
be correctly ascertained in the prejudiced and calumnious writings of
the Fathers of the Church; but rather in what remains of the works of
the Bardesanesians, known as the Nazarenes. It is next to impossible,
now that all their manuscripts and books are destroyed, to assign to any
of these sects its due part in dissenting views. But there are a few men
still living who have preserved books and direct traditions about the
Ophites, although they care little to impart them to the world. Among
the unknown sects of Mount Lebanon and Palestine the truth has been
concealed for more than a thousand years. And their <em>diagram</em> of the
Ophite scheme differs with the description of it given by Origen and
hence with the <em>diagram</em> of
 <span class="lock">Matter.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_416" id="FNanchor_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>

The kabalistic trinity is one of the models of the Christian one. “The
<span class="allsmcap">ANCIENT</span> whose name be sanctified, is with three heads, but which make
only <span class="lock">one.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_417" id="FNanchor_417">[417]</a></span>
 <i lang="la">Tria capita exsculpa sunt, unum intra alterum, et alterum
supra alterum.</i> Three heads are inserted in one another, and one over
the other. The first head is the Concealed Wisdom (<i>Sapientia Abscondita</i>).
Under this head is the <span class="allsmcap">ANCIENT</span> (Pythagorean <i>Monad</i>), the most
hidden of mysteries; a head which is no head (<i lang="la">caput quod non est caput</i>);
no one can know what that is in this head. No intellect is able to comprehend
this <span class="lock">wisdom.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_418" id="FNanchor_418">[418]</a></span>
 This <i>Senior Sanctissimus</i> is surrounded by the
three heads. He is the eternal <span class="allsmcap">LIGHT</span> of the wisdom; and the wisdom is
the source from which all the manifestations have begun. These three
heads, included in <span class="allsmcap">ONE HEAD</span> (which is no head); and these three are
bent down (overshadow) <span class="allsmcap">SHORT-FACE</span> (the son) and through them all
things shine with <span class="lock">light.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_419" id="FNanchor_419">[419]</a></span>
 “En-Soph emits a thread from El or <i>Al</i> (the
highest God of the Trinity), and the light follows the thread and enters,
and passing through makes its exit through Adam <i>Primus</i> (Kadmon),
who is <em>concealed</em> until the plan for arranging (<i lang="la">statum dispositionis</i>) is
ready; it threads through him from his head to his feet; and in him (in
the concealed Adam) is the figure of <span class="allsmcap">A</span>
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_420" id="FNanchor_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whoso wishes to have an insight into the sacred unity, let him consider
a flame rising from a burning coal or a burning lamp. He will see
first a two-fold light—a bright white, and a black or blue light; the white
light is <em>above</em>, and ascends in a direct light, while the blue, or dark light,
is <em>below</em>, and seems as the chair of the former, yet both are so intimately
connected together that they constitute only one flame. The seat, however,
formed by the blue or dark light, is again connected with the burning
matter which is <em>under</em> it again. The white light never changes its color,
it always remains white; but various shades are observed in the lower
light, whilst the lowest light, moreover, takes two directions; <em>above</em>, it is
connected with the white light, and <em>below</em> with the burning matter. Now,
this is constantly consuming itself, and perpetually ascends to the upper
light, and thus everything merges into a single
 <span class="lock">unity.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_421" id="FNanchor_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>Such were the ancient ideas of the trinity in the unity, as an abstraction.
Man, who is the microcosmos of the macrocosmos, or of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>

archetypal heavenly man, Adam Kadmon, is likewise a trinity; for he is
<em>body</em>, <em>soul</em>, and <em>spirit</em>.</p>

<p>“All that is created by the ‘Ancient of the Ancients’ can live and
exist only by a male and a female,” says the
 <span class="lock">Sohar.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_422" id="FNanchor_422">[422]</a></span>
 He alone, to whom
no one can say, “Thou,” for he is the spirit of the <span class="smcap">White-Head</span> in
whom the “<span class="smcap">Three Heads</span>” are united, is uncreated. Out of the subtile
fire, on one side of the White Head, and of the “subtile air,” on
the other, emanates Shekinah, his veil (the femininized Holy Ghost).
“This air,” says Idra Rabba, “is the most occult (occultissimus) attribute
of the Ancient of the
 <span class="lock">Days.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_423" id="FNanchor_423">[423]</a></span>
 The Ancienter of the Ancienter is the
<em>Concealed</em> of the <span class="lock">Concealed.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_424" id="FNanchor_424">[424]</a></span>
 All things are Himself, and Himself is
concealed on every <span class="lock">way.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_425" id="FNanchor_425">[425]</a></span>
 The <em>cranium</em> of the <span class="smcap">White-Head</span> has no
beginning, but its end has a shining reflection and a <em>roundness</em> which is
our universe.”</p>

<p>“They regard,” says Klenker, “the first-born as man and wife, in so
far as his light includes in itself all other lights, and in so far as his
spirit of life or breath of life includes all other life spirits in
 <span class="lock">itself.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_426" id="FNanchor_426">[426]</a></span>
The kabalistic Shekinah answers to the Ophite Sophia. Properly
speaking, Adam Kadmon is the Bythos, but in this emanation-system,
where everything is calculated to perplex and place an obstacle to
inquiry, he is the <em>Source</em> of Light, the first “primitive man,” and at the
same time <em>Ennoia</em>, the Thought of Bythos, the Depth, for he is
Pimander.</p>

<p>The Gnostics, as well as the Nazarenes, allegorizing on the personification,
said that the <em>First</em> and <em>Second</em> man loved the beauty of Sophia,
(Sephira) the first woman, and thus the Father and the Son fecundated
the heavenly “Woman” and, from primal darkness procreated the visible
light (Sephira is the Invisible, or Spiritual Light), “whom they
called the <span class="smcap">Anointed Christum</span>, or King
 <span class="lock">Messiah.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_427" id="FNanchor_427">[427]</a></span>
 This Christus is
the <em>Adam of Dust</em> before his fall, with the spirit of the Adonai, his
Father, and Shekinah Adonai, his mother, upon him; for Adam Primus
is Adon, Adonai, or Adonis. The primal existence manifests itself by
its wisdom, and produces the <em>Intelligible</em> <span class="smcap">Logos</span> (all visible creation).
This wisdom was venerated by the Ophites under the form of a serpent.
So far we see that the first and second life are the two Adams, or the
first and the second man. In the former lies <i>Eva</i>, or the yet unborn
spiritual Eve, and she is within Adam <i>Primus</i>, for she is a part of himself,
who is androgyne. The Eva of dust, she who will be called in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>

<cite>Genesis</cite> “the mother of all that live,” is <em>within</em> Adam the Second.
And now, from the moment of its first manifestation, the <span class="smcap">Lord Mano</span>,
the Unintelligible Wisdom, disappears from the scene of action. It will
manifest itself only as Shekinah, the <span class="allsmcap">GRACE</span>; for the <span class="smcap">Corona</span> is “the
innermost Light of all Lights,” and hence it is darkness’s own
 <span class="lock">substance.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_428" id="FNanchor_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <cite>Kabala</cite>, Shekinah is the ninth emanation of Sephira, which
contains the whole of the ten Sephiroth within herself. She belongs to
the third triad and is produced together with <i>Malchuth</i> or “Kingdom,”
of which she is the female counterpart. Otherwise she is held to be
higher than any of these; for she is the “Divine Glory,” the “veil,” or
“garment,” of En-Soph. The Jews, whenever she is mentioned in the
<cite>Targum</cite>, say that she is the glory of Jehovah, which dwelt in the tabernacle,
manifesting herself like a visible cloud; the “Glory” rested over
the Mercy-Seat in the <i lang="la">Sanctum Sanctorum</i>.</p>

<p>In the Nazarene or Bardesanian System, which may be termed the
Kabala within the Kabala, the Ancient of Days—<i lang="la">Antiquus Altus</i>, who
is the Father of the Demiurgus of the universe, is called the <em>Third</em> Life,
or <i>Abatur</i>; and he is the Father of Fetahil, who is the architect of
the visible universe, which he calls into existence by the powers of his
genii, at the order of the “Greatest;” the Abatur answering to the
“Father” of Jesus in the later Christian theology. These two superior
<em>Lives</em> then, are the crown within which dwells the greatest <i>Ferho</i>. “Before
any creature came into existence the Lord Ferho
 <span class="lock">existed.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_429" id="FNanchor_429">[429]</a></span> This
one is the First Life, formless and invisible; in whom the living Spirit
of <span class="smcap">Life</span> exists, the Highest <span class="smcap">Grace</span>. The two are <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> from eternity,
for they are the Light and the <span class="allsmcap">CAUSE</span> of the Light. Therefore, they
answer to the kabalistic concealed <em>wisdom</em>, and to the concealed Shekinah—the
Holy Ghost. “This light, which is manifested, is the garment
of the Heavenly Concealed,” says Idra Suta. And the “heavenly
man” is the superior Adam. “No one knows his paths except <i>Macroprosopus</i>”
(Long-face)—the Superior <em>active</em>
 <span class="lock">god.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_430" id="FNanchor_430">[430]</a></span>
 “Not as I am <em>written</em>
will I be read; in this world my name will be written Jehovah and read
<span class="lock">Adonai,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_431" id="FNanchor_431">[431]</a></span>
 say the Rabbins, very correctly. Adonai is the Adam Kadmon;
he is <span class="smcap">Father</span> and <span class="smcap">Mother</span> both. By this double mediatorship
the Spirit of the “Ancient of the Ancient” descends upon the <i>Microprosopus</i>
(Short-face) or the Adam of Eden. And the “Lord God breathes
into his nostrils the breath of life.”</p>

<p>When the woman separates herself from her androgyne, and becomes

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>

a distinct individuality, the first story is repeated over again. Both the
Father and Son, the two Adams, love her beauty; and then follows the
allegory of the temptation and fall. It is in the <cite>Kabala</cite>, as in the Ophite
system, in which both the Ophis and the Ophiomorphos are emanations
emblematized as serpents, the former representing Eternity, Wisdom,
and Spirit (as in the Chaldean Magism of Aspic-worship and Wisdom-Doctrine
in the olden times), and the latter Cunning, Envy, and Matter.
Both spirit and matter are serpents; and Adam Kadmon becomes the
Ophis who tempts himself—man and woman—to taste of the “Tree of
Good and Evil,” in order to teach them the mysteries of spiritual wisdom.
Light tempts Darkness, and Darkness attracts Light, for Darkness
is <em>matter</em>, and “the <em>Highest</em> Light shines not in its <em>Tenebræ</em>.”
With knowledge comes the temptation of the Ophiomorphos, and he
prevails. The dualism of every existing religion is shown forth by the
fall. “I have gotten a man from <em>the Lord</em>,” exclaims Eve, when the
Dualism, Cain and Abel—evil and good—is born. “And the Adam
knew Hua, his woman (<i>astu</i>), and she became pregnant and bore <i>Kin</i>,
and she said: קינתי איש את־יהוה: <i>Kiniti ais</i> Yava.—I have gained or
obtained a husband, even <i>Yava</i>—Is, Ais—man.” “<i lang="la">Cum arbore peccati
Deus creavit seculum.</i>”</p>

<p>And now we will compare this system with that of the Jewish Gnostics—the
Nazarenes, as well as with other philosophies.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Ish Amon</span>, the pleroma, or the boundless circle within which lie
“all forms,” is the <span class="allsmcap">THOUGHT</span> of the power divine; it works in <span class="allsmcap">SILENCE</span>,
and suddenly light is begotten by darkness; it is called the <span class="allsmcap">SECOND</span> life;
and this one produces, or generates the <span class="allsmcap">THIRD</span>. This third light is “the
<span class="allsmcap">FATHER</span> of all things that live,” as <span class="smcap">Eua</span> is the “mother of all that
live.” He is the Creator who calls inert matter into life, through his
vivifying spirit, and, therefore, is called the ancient of the world. Abatur
is the Father who creates the first Adam, who creates in his turn the
second. Abatur opens a gate and walks to the dark water (chaos), and
looking down into it, the darkness reflects the image of Himself ...
and lo! a <span class="smcap">Son</span> is formed—the Logos or Demiurge; Fetahil, who is the
builder of the <em>material</em> world, is called into existence. According to the
Gnostic dogma, this was the <i>Metatron</i>, the Archangel Gabriel, or messenger
of life; or, as the biblical allegory has it, the androgynous Adam-Kadmon
again, the <span class="smcap">Son</span>, who, with his Father’s spirit, produces the
<span class="allsmcap">ANOINTED</span>, or Adam before his fall.</p>

<p>When Swayambhuva, the “Lord who exists through himself,” feels
impelled to manifest himself, he is thus described in the Hindu sacred
books.</p>

<p>Having been impelled to produce various beings from his own divine

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>

substance, he first manifested the waters which developed within themselves
a productive seed.</p>

<p>The seed became a germ bright as gold, blazing like the luminary
with a thousand beams; and in that egg he was born himself, in the form
of <span class="smcap">Brahma</span>, the great principle of all the beings
 (<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="one">i.,</abbr> slokas
8, 9).</p>

<p>The Egyptian Kneph, or Chnuphis, Divine Wisdom, represented by
a serpent, produces an egg from his mouth, from which issues Phtha.
In this case Phtha represents the universal germ, as well as Brahmä, who
is of the neuter gender, when the final <i>a</i> has a diaresis on
 <span class="lock">it;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_432" id="FNanchor_432">[432]</a></span>
 otherwise
it becomes simply one of the names of the Deity. The former was the
model of the <span class="smcap">Three Lives</span> of the Nazarenes, as that of the kabalistic
“Faces,” <span class="smcap">Pharazupha</span>, which, in its turn, furnished the model for the
Christian Trinity of Irenæus and his followers. The egg was the primitive
matter which served as a material for the building of the visible universe;
it contained, as well as the Gnostic Pleroma, the kabalistic Shekinah,
the man and wife, the spirit and life, “whose light includes all
other lights” or life-spirits. This first manifestation was symbolized by a
serpent, which is at first <em>divine</em> wisdom, but, <em>falling into generation</em>,
becomes polluted. Phtha is the heavenly man, the Egyptian Adam-Kadmon,
or Christ, who, in conjunction with the female Holy Ghost, the
<span class="smcap">Zoe</span>, produces the five elements, air, water, fire, earth, and ether; the
latter being a servile copy from the Buddhist A’d, and his five Dhyana
Buddhas, as we have shown in the preceding chapter. The Hindu
Swayambhuva-Nara, develops from himself the <em>mother-principle</em>, enclosed
within his own divine essence—Nari, the immortal Virgin, who, when
impregnated by his spirit, becomes Taumâtra, the mother of the five
elements—air, water, fire, earth, and ether. Thus may be shown how
from the Hindu cosmogony all others proceed.</p>

<p>Knorr von Rosenroth, busying himself with the interpretation of the
<cite>Kabala</cite>, argues that, “In this first state (of secret wisdom), the infinite
God Himself can be understood as ‘Father’ (of the new covenant).
But the <em>Light</em> being let down by the Infinite through a canal into the
‘primal Adam,’ or <em>Messiah</em>, and joined with him, can be applied to the
name <span class="smcap">Son</span>. And the influx emitted down from him (the Son) to the
lower parts (of the universe), can be applied to the character of the Holy
<span class="lock">Ghost.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_433" id="FNanchor_433">[433]</a></span>
 Sophia-Achamoth, the half-spiritual, half-material <span class="smcap">Life</span>, which
vivifies the inert matter in the depths of chaos, is the Holy Ghost of the
Gnostics, and the <i>Spiritus</i> (female) of the Nazarenes. She is—be it remembered—the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>

<em>sister</em> of <i>Christos</i>, the perfect emanation, and both are
children or emanations of Sophia, the purely spiritual and intellectual
daughter of Bythos, the Depth. For the elder Sophia is Shekinah, the
Face of God, “God’s Shekinah, which is his
 <span class="lock">image.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_434" id="FNanchor_434">[434]</a></span></p>

<p>“The <i>Son</i> Zeus-Belus, or Sol-Mithra is an image of the Father, an
emanation from the <em>Supreme Light</em>,” says Movers. “He passed for
<span class="lock">Creator.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_435" id="FNanchor_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>“Philosophers say the first air is <i lang="la">anima mundi</i>. But the garment
(Shekinah) is higher than the first air, since it is joined closer to the En-Soph,
the <span class="lock">Boundless.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_436" id="FNanchor_436">[436]</a></span>
 Thus <i>Sophia</i> is Shekinah, and Sophia-Achamoth
the <i lang="la">anima mundi</i>, the astral light of the kabalists, which contains the
spiritual and material germs of all <em>that is</em>. For the Sophia-Achamoth,
like <i>Eve</i>, of whom she is the prototype, is “the mother of all that live.”</p>

<p>There are three trinities in the Nazarene system as well as in the
Hindu philosophy of the ante and early Vedic period. While we see
the few translators of the <cite>Kabala</cite>, the Nazarene <cite>Codex</cite>, and other abstruse
works, hopelessly floundering amid the interminable pantheon of names,
unable to agree as to a system in which to classify them, for the one
hypothesis contradicts and overturns the other, we can but wonder at all
this trouble, which could be so easily overcome. But even now, when
the translation, and even the perusal of the ancient Sanscrit has become
so easy as a point of comparison, they would never think it possible that
every philosophy—whether Semitic, Hamitic, or Turanian, as they call it,
has its key in the Hindu sacred works. Still facts are there, and facts
are not easily destroyed. Thus, while we find the Hindu trimurti triply
manifested as</p>

<p>The first is the concealed or non-manifested trinity—a pure abstraction.
The other the active or the one revealed in the results of creation,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
proceeding out of the former—its spiritual prototype. The third is the
mutilated image of both the others, crystallized in the form of human
dogmas, which vary according to the exuberance of the national materialistic
fancy.</p>

<p>The Supreme Lord of splendor and of light, luminous and refulgent,
before which no other existed, is called Corona (the crown); Lord Ferho,
the unrevealed life which existed in the former from eternity; and Lord
Jordan—the spirit, the living water of
 <span class="lock">grace.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_438" id="FNanchor_438">[438]</a></span>
 He is the one through
whom alone we can be saved; and thus he answers to the Shekinah, the
spiritual garment of En-Soph, or the Holy Ghost. These three constitute
the trinity in <i lang="la">abscondito</i>. The second trinity is composed of the three
lives. The first is the similitude of Lord Ferho, through whom he has
proceeded forth; and the second Ferho is the King of Light—<span class="smcap">Mano</span>
(<i lang="la">Rex Lucis</i>). He is the heavenly life and light, and older than the
Architect of heaven and
 <span class="lock">earth.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_439" id="FNanchor_439">[439]</a></span>
 The second life is <i>Ish Amon</i> (Pleroma),
the vase of election, containing the visible thought of the <i lang="la">Iordanus Maximus</i>—the
<i>type</i> (or its intelligible reflection), the prototype of the living
water, who is the “spiritual
 <span class="lock">Jordan.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_440" id="FNanchor_440">[440]</a></span>
 Third life, which is produced
by the other two, is <span class="smcap">Abatur</span> (<i>Ab</i>, the Parent or Father). This is the
mysterious and decrepit “Aged of the Aged,” the “Ancient <i lang="la">Senem sui
obtegentem et grandævum mundi</i>.” This latter third Life is the Father of
the Demiurge Fetahil, the Creator of the world, whom the Ophites call
<span class="lock">Ilda-Baoth,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_441" id="FNanchor_441">[441]</a></span>
 though Fetahil is the <em>only-begotten one</em>, the reflection of
the Father, Abatur, who begets him by looking into the “dark
 <span class="lock">water;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_442" id="FNanchor_442">[442]</a></span>
but the Lord Mano, “the Lord of loftiness, the Lord of all genii,” is
higher than the Father, in this kabalistic <cite>Codex</cite>—one is purely spiritual,
the other material. So, for instance, while Abatur’s “only begotten”
one is the genius Fetahil, the Creator of the physical world, Lord Mano,
the “Lord of Celsitude,” who is the son of Him, who is “the Father of
all who preach the Gospel,” produces also an “only-begotten” one, the
Lord Lehdaio, “a just Lord.” He is the Christos, the anointed, who
pours out the “grace” of the Invisible Jordan, the Spirit of the <em>Highest
Crown</em>.</p>

<p>In the Arcanum, “in the assembly of splendor, lighted by <span class="smcap">Mano</span>, to
whom the scintillas of splendor owe their origin,” the genii who live in
light “rose, they went to the visible Jordan, and flowing water ... they
assembled for a counsel ... and called forth the Only-Begotten Son

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">229</a></span>

of an imperishable image, and who cannot be conceived by reflection,
Lehdaio, the just Lord, and sprung from Lehdaio, the just lord, whom
the life had produced by his <span class="lock">word.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_443" id="FNanchor_443">[443]</a></span></p>

<p>Mano is the chief of the seven Æons, who are Mano (<i lang="la">Rex Lucis</i>)
Aiar Zivo, Ignis Vivus, Lux, Vita, Aqua Viva (the living water of
baptism, the genius of the Jordan), and Ipsa Vita, the chief of the six
genii, which form with him the mystic <em>seven</em>. The Nazarene Mano is
simply the copy of the Hindu first Manu—the emanation of Manu
Swayambhuva—from whom evolve in succession the six other Manus,
types of the subsequent races of men. We find them all represented by
the apostle-kabalist John in the “seven lamps of fire” burning before
the throne, which are the seven spirits of
 <span class="lock">God,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_444" id="FNanchor_444">[444]</a></span>
 and in the seven angels
bearing the seven vials. Again in Fetahil we recognize the original of
the Christian doctrine.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Revelation</cite> of Joannes Theologos it is said: “I turned and
saw in the midst of the <em>seven</em> candlesticks one like unto the Son of
man ... his head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
and his eyes were as a flame of fire ... and his feet like unto fine brass,
as if they burned in a furnace” (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 13, 14, 15). <cite>John</cite> here repeats, as is
well known, the words of Daniel and Ezekiel. “The Ancient of Days
... whose hair was white as pure wool ... etc.” And “the appearance
of a <em>man</em> ... above the throne ... and the appearance of fire,
and it had brightness round
 <span class="lock">about.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_445" id="FNanchor_445">[445]</a></span>
 The fire being “the glory of the
Lord.” Fetahil is son of the man, the Third Life, and his upper part
is represented as white as snow, while standing near the throne of the
living fire he has the appearance of a flame.</p>

<p>All these “apocalyptic” visions are based on the description of the
“white head” of the Sohar, in whom the kabalistic trinity is united.
The white head, “which conceals in its cranium the spirit,” and which is
environed by subtile fire. The “appearance of a man” is that of Adam
Kadmon, through which passes the thread of light represented by the
fire. Fetahil is the <i lang="la">Vir Novissimis</i> (the newest man), the son of Abatur,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_446" id="FNanchor_446">[446]</a>
the latter being the “man,” or the <em>third</em>
 <span class="lock">life,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_447" id="FNanchor_447">[447]</a></span>
 now the third personage of
the trinity. <cite>John</cite> sees “one like unto the son of man,” holding in his
right hand seven stars, and standing between “seven golden candlesticks”
(<cite>Revelation</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>). Fetahil takes his “stand on high,” according to
the will of his father, “the highest Æon who has seven sceptres,” and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>

seven genii, who astronomically represent the seven planets or stars.
He stands “shining in the garment of the Lord’s, resplendent by the
agency of the
 <span class="lock">genii.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_448" id="FNanchor_448">[448]</a></span>
 He is the Son of his Father, Life, and his mother,
Spirit, or
 <span class="lock">Light.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_449" id="FNanchor_449">[449]</a></span>
 The Logos is represented in the <cite>Gospel according to
John</cite> as one in whom was “<em>Life</em>, and the life was the <em>light</em> of men” (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 4).
Fetahil is the Demiurge, and his father created the visible universe of
matter through
 <span class="lock">him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_450" id="FNanchor_450">[450]</a></span>
 In the <cite>Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians</cite> (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 9),
God is said to have “<em>created all things</em> by Jesus.” In the <cite>Codex</cite> the
Parent-<span class="smcap">Life</span> says: “Arise, go, our son first-begotten, ordained for all
<span class="lock">creatures.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_451" id="FNanchor_451">[451]</a></span>
 “As the living father hath sent me,” says Christ, “God
sent his only-begotten son that we might
 <span class="lock">live.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_452" id="FNanchor_452">[452]</a></span>
 Finally, having performed
his work on earth, Fetahil reascends to his father Abatur. “<i lang="la">Et
qui, relicto quem procreavit mundo, ad Abatur suum patrem</i>
 <span class="lock"><i lang="la">contendit.</i>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_453" id="FNanchor_453">[453]</a></span>
“My father sent me ... I go to the Father,” repeats Jesus.</p>

<p>Laying aside the theological disputes of Christianity which try to
blend together the Jewish Creator of the first chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite> with
the “Father” of the <cite>New Testament</cite>, Jesus states repeatedly of his
Father that “He is <em>in secret</em>.” Surely he would not have so termed the
ever-present “Lord God” of the Mosaic books, who showed Himself to
Moses and the Patriarchs, and finally allowed all the elders of Israel
to look on
 <span class="lock">Himself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_454" id="FNanchor_454">[454]</a></span>
 When Jesus is made to speak of the temple at
Jerusalem as of his “Father’s house,” he does not mean the physical
building, which he maintains he can destroy and then again rebuild in
three days, but of the temple of Solomon; the wise kabalist, who indicates
in his <cite>Proverbs</cite> that every man is the temple of God, or of his
own divine spirit. This term of the “Father who is in secret,” we find
used as much in the <cite>Kabala</cite> as in the <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>, and elsewhere.
No one has ever seen the wisdom concealed in the “Cranium,” and
no one has beheld the “Depth” (Bythos). Simon, the <em>Magician</em>,
preached “one Father unknown to
 <span class="lock">all.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_455" id="FNanchor_455">[455]</a></span></p>

<p>We can trace this appellation of a “secret” God still farther back.
In the <cite>Kabala</cite> the “Son” of the <em>concealed</em> Father who dwells in light
and glory, is the “Anointed,” the <i>Seir-Anpin</i>, who unites in himself all
the Sephiroth, he is Christos, or the Heavenly man. It is through
Christ that the Pneuma, or the Holy Ghost, creates “all things”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>

(<cite>Ephesians</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 9), and produces the four elements, air, water, fire, and
earth. This assertion is unquestionable, for we find Irenæus basing on
this fact his best argument for the necessity of there being four gospels.
There can be neither more nor fewer than four—he argues. “For as
there are four quarters of the world, and four general winds (<a id="Greekch2"></a>καθολικὰ πνεύματα) ... it is right that she (the Church) should have four pillars.
From which it is manifest that the Word, <em>the maker of all</em>, he <em>who sitteth
upon the Cherubim</em> ... as David says, supplicating his advent, ‘Thou
that sittest between the Cherubim, shine forth!’ For the Cherubim also
are <em>four-faced</em> and their faces are symbols of the working of the Son of
<span class="lock">God.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_456" id="FNanchor_456">[456]</a></span></p>

<p>We will not stop to discuss at length the special holiness of the four-faced
Cherubim, although we might, perhaps, show their origin in all
the ancient pagodas of India, in the <i>vehans</i> (or vehicles) of their chief
gods; as likewise we might easily attribute the respect paid to them to
the kabalistic wisdom, which, nevertheless, the Church rejects with
great horror. But, we cannot resist the temptation to remind the
reader that he may easily ascertain the several significances attributed
to these Cherubs by reading the <cite>Kabala</cite>. “When the souls are to leave
their abode,” says the <cite>Sohar</cite>, holding to the doctrine of the pre-existence
of souls in the world of emanations, “each soul separately
appears before the Holy King, dressed in a sublime form, with the features
in which it is to appear in this world. It is from this sublime form
that the image proceeds” (<cite>Sohar</cite>, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 104 ab). Then it goes on to
say that the types or forms of these faces are four in number—those of
the angel or man, of the lion, the bull, and the eagle. Furthermore,
we may well express our wonder that Irenæus should not have re-enforced
his argument for the four gospels—by citing the whole Pantheon
of the four-armed Hindu gods?</p>

<p>Ezekiel in representing his four animals, now called Cherubim, as
types of the four symbolical beings, which, in his visions support the
throne of Jehovah, had not far to go for his models. The Chaldeo-Babylonian
protecting genii were familiar to him; the Sed, Alap or
<i>Kirub</i> (Cherubim), the bull, with the human face; the Nirgal, human-headed
lion; Oustour the Sphinx-man; and the Nathga, with its eagle’s
head. The religion of the masters—the idolatrous Babylonians and
Assyrians—was transferred almost bodily into the revealed Scripture of
the Captives, and from thence came into Christianity.</p>

<p>Already, we find Ezekiel addressed by the likeness of the glory
of the Lord, “as Son of man.” This peculiar title is used repeatedly

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>

throughout the whole book of this prophet, which is as kabalistic as
the “roll of a book” which the “Glory” causes him to eat. It is written
<em>within</em> and <em>without</em>; and its real meaning is identical with that of
the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>. It appears strange that so much stress should be laid
on this peculiar appellation, said to have been applied by Jesus to himself,
when, in the symbolical or kabalistic language, a prophet is so
addressed. It is as extraordinary to see Irenæus indulging in such
graphic descriptions of Jesus as to show him, “the maker of all, sitting
upon a Cherubim,” unless he identifies him with Shekinah, whose usual
place was among the Charoubs of the Mercy Seat. We also know that
the Cherubim and Seraphim are titles of the “Old Serpent” (the orthodox
Devil) the Seraphs being the burning or fiery serpents, in kabalistic
symbolism. The ten emanations of Adam Kadmon, called the
Sephiroth, have all emblems and titles corresponding to each. So, for
instance, the last two are Victory, or Jehovah-Sabaoth, whose symbol
is the right column of Solomon, the Pillar <i>Jachin</i>; while <span class="allsmcap">GLORY</span> is the
left Pillar, or Boaz, and its name is “the Old Serpent,” and also “Seraphim
and <span class="lock">Cherubim.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_457" id="FNanchor_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Son of man” is an appellation which could not be assumed
by any one but a kabalist. Except, as shown above, in the <cite>Old Testament</cite>,
it is used but by one prophet—Ezekiel, the kabalist. In their
mysterious and mutual relations, the Æons or Sephiroth are represented
in the <cite>Kabala</cite> by a great number of circles, and sometimes by the figure
of a <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>, which is symbolically formed out of such circles. This man
is Seir-Anpin, and the 243 numbers of which his figure consists relate
to the different orders of the celestial hierarchy. The original idea of
this figure, or rather the model, may have been taken from the Hindu
Brahma, and the various castes typified by the several parts of his body,
as King suggests in his <cite>Gnostics</cite>. In one of the grandest and most
beautiful cave-temples at Ellora, Nasak, dedicated to Vishvakarma,
son of Brahma, is a representation of this God and his attributes. To
one acquainted with Ezekiel’s description of the “likeness of four
living creatures,” every one of which had four faces and the hands of
a man under its wings,
 <span class="lock">etc.,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_458" id="FNanchor_458">[458]</a></span>
 this figure at Ellora must certainly appear
absolutely <em>biblical</em>. Brahma is called the father of “man,” as well as
Jupiter and other highest gods.</p>

<p>It is in the Buddhistic representations of Mount Meru, called by the
Burmese <i>Myé-nmo</i>, and by the Siamese <i>Sineru</i>, that we find one of the
originals of the Adam Kadmon, Seir-Anpin, the “heavenly man,” and
of all the Æons, Sephiroth, Powers, Dominions, Thrones, Virtues, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>

Dignities of the <cite>Kabala</cite>. Between two pillars, which are connected by
an arch, the key-stone of the latter is represented by a <em>crescent</em>. This is
the domain in which dwells the Supreme Wisdom of A’di Buddha, the
Supreme and invisible Deity. Beneath this highest central point comes
the circle of the direct emanation of the Unknown—the circle of Brahma
with some Hindus, of the first <em>avatar</em> of Buddha, according to others.
This answers to Adam Kadmon and the ten Sephiroth. Nine of the
emanations are encircled by the tenth, and occasionally represented by
pagodas, each of which bears a name which expresses one of the chief
attributes of the manifested Deity. Then below come the seven stages,
or heavenly spheres, each sphere being encircled by a sea. These are
the celestial mansions of the <i>devatas</i>, or gods, each losing somewhat in
holiness and purity as it approaches the earth. Then comes Meru itself,
formed of numberless circles within three large ones, typifying the trinity
of man; and for one acquainted with the numerical value of the letters in
biblical names, like that of the “Great Beast,” or that of Mithra μειθρας αβραξας,
 and others, it is an easy matter to establish the identity of the
Meru-gods with the emanations or Sephiroth of the kabalists. Also the
genii of the Nazarenes, with their special missions, are all found on this
most ancient mythos, a most perfect representation of the symbolism of
the “secret doctrine,” as taught in archaic ages.</p>

<p>King gives a few hints—though doubtless too insufficient to teach
anything important, for they are based upon the calculations of Bishop
 Newton<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_459" id="FNanchor_459">[459]</a>—as
 to this mode of finding out mysteries in the value of letters.
However, we find this great archæologist, who has devoted so much time
and labor to the study of Gnostic gems, corroborating our assertion. He
shows that the entire theory is Hindu, and points out that the durga, or
female counterpart of each Asiatic god, is what the kabalists term active
 <span class="lock"><i>Virtue</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_460" id="FNanchor_460">[460]</a></span>
 in the celestial hierarchy, a term which the Christian Fathers
adopted and repeated, without fully appreciating, and the meaning of
which the later theology has utterly disfigured. But to return to Meru.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>

The whole is surrounded by the Maha Samut, or the great sea—the
astral light and ether of the kabalists and scientists; and within the central
circles appears “the likeness of a man.” He is the Achadoth of
the Nazarenes, the twofold unity, or the androgyne man; the heavenly
incarnation, and a perfect representation of Seir-Anpin (short-face), the
son of <i>Arich Anpin</i>
 <span class="lock">(long-face).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_461" id="FNanchor_461">[461]</a></span>
 This likeness is now represented in
many lamaseries by Gautama-Buddha, the last of the incarnated avatars.
Still lower, under the Meru, is the dwelling of the great Naga, who is
called <i>Rajah Naga</i>, the king-serpent—the serpent of <cite>Genesis</cite>, the Gnostic
Ophis—and the goddess of the earth, Bhumây Nari, or Yâma, who waits
upon the great dragon, for she is Eve, “the mother of all that live.” Still
lower is the eighth sphere, the infernal regions. The uppermost regions
of Brahma are surrounded by the sun, moon, and planets, the seven stellars
of the Nazarenes, and just as they are described in the <cite>Codex</cite>.</p>

<p>“The seven impostor-Dæmons who deceive the sons of Adam. The
name of one is <i>Sol</i>; of another <i>Spiritus Venereus</i>, Astro; of the third
<i>Nebu</i>, Mercurius <i>a false Messiah</i>; ... the name of a fourth is Sin
<i>Luna</i>; the fifth is <i>Kiun</i>, Saturnus; the sixth, Bel-Zeus; the seventh,
 <span class="lock">Nerig-<i>Mars</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_462" id="FNanchor_462">[462]</a></span>
 Then there are “<i>Seven Lives</i> procreated,” seven good
Stellars, “which are from Cabar Zio, and are those bright ones who shine
in their own form and splendor that pours from on high.... At the
gate of the <span class="smcap">House of Life</span> the throne is fitly placed for the Lord of
Splendor, and there are <span class="allsmcap">THREE</span>
 <span class="lock">habitations.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_463" id="FNanchor_463">[463]</a></span>
 The habitations of the
<i>Trimurti</i>, the Hindu trinity, are placed beneath the key-stone—the golden
crescent, in the representation of Meru. “And there was under his feet
(of the God of Israel) as it were a paved work of a sapphire-stone”
(<cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="twenty-four">xxiv.</abbr> 10). Under the crescent is the heaven of Brahma, all
paved with sapphires. The paradise of Indra is resplendent with a thousand
suns; that of Siva (Saturn), is in the northeast; his throne is formed
of lapis-lazuli and the floor of heaven is of fervid gold. “When he sits
on the throne he blazes with fire up to <em>the loins</em>.” At Hurdwar, during
the fair, in which he is more than ever Mahadeva, the highest god, the
attributes and emblems sacred to the Jewish “Lord God,” may be recognized
one by one in those of Siva. The Binlang
 <span class="lock">stone,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_464" id="FNanchor_464">[464]</a></span>
 sacred to this
Hindu deity, is an unhewn stone like the Beth-el, consecrated by the
Patriarch Jacob, and set up by him “for a pillar,” and like the latter

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>

Binlang is <em>anointed</em>. We need hardly remind the student that the <i>linga</i>,
the emblem sacred to Siva and whose temples are modelled after this
form, is identical in shape, meaning, and purpose with the “pillars” set
up by the several patriarchs to mark their adoration of the Lord God.
In fact, one of these patriarchal lithoï might even now be carried in the
Sivaitic processions of Calcutta, without its Hebrew derivation being suspected.
The four arms of Siva are often represented with appendages
like wings; he has <em>three</em> eyes and a <em>fourth</em> in the crescent, obtained
by him at the churning of the ocean, as Pâncha Mukhti Siva has four
heads.</p>

<p>In this god we recognize the description given by Ezekiel, in the first
chapter of his book, of his vision, in which he beholds the “likeness of a
man” in the four living creatures, who had “four faces, four wings,”
who had one pair of “straight feet ... which sparkled like the color <em>of
burnished</em> brass ... and their rings were full of eyes round about them
four.” It is the throne and heaven of Siva that the prophet describes in
saying “... and there was the likeness of a throne as the appearance
of a sapphire stone ... and I saw as the color of amber (gold) as the appearance
of fire around about ... from his loins even upward, and from
the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance
of fire” (<cite>Ezekiel</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 27). “And his feet like unto fine brass, as if
they burned in a furnace” (<cite>Revelation</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 15). “As for their faces ...
one had the face of a cherub, and the face of a lion ... they also had
the face of <em>an ox</em> and the face of an eagle” (<cite>Ezekiel</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 10, <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 14). This
<em>fourfold</em> appearance which we find in the two <em>cherubims</em> of gold on the
two ends of the ark; these symbolic four <em>faces</em> being adopted, moreover,
later, one by each evangelist, as may be easily ascertained from the
pictures of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
 <span class="lock">John,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_465" id="FNanchor_465">[465]</a></span>
 prefixed to their respective
gospels in the Roman Vulgate and Greek <cite>Bibles</cite>.</p>

<p>“Taaut, the great god of the Phœnicians,” says Sanchoniathon, “to
express the character of Saturn or Kronos, made his image having four
eyes ... two before, two behind, open and closed, and four wings, two
expanded, two folded. The eyes denote that the god sees in sleep, and
sleeps in waking; the position of the wings that he flies in rest, and rests
in flying.”</p>

<p>The identity of Saturn with Siva is corroborated still more when we
consider the emblem of the latter, the <i>damara</i>, which is an hour-glass, to
show the progress of time, represented by this god in his capacity of a
destroyer. The bull Nardi, the <i>vehan</i> of Siva and the most sacred emblem

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>

of this god, is reproduced in the Egyptian Apis; and in the bull
created by Ormazd and killed by Ahriman. The religion of Zoroaster,
all based upon the “secret doctrine,” is found held by the people of
Eritene; it was the religion of the Persians when they conquered the
Assyrians. From thence it is easy to trace the introduction of this emblem
of <span class="smcap">Life</span> represented by the Bull, in every religious system. The
college of the Magians had accepted it with the change of
 <span class="lock">dynasty;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_466" id="FNanchor_466">[466]</a></span>
Daniel is described as a Rabbi, the chief of the Babylonian astrologers
and
 <span class="lock">Magi;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_467" id="FNanchor_467">[467]</a></span>
 therefore we see the Assyrian little bulls and the attributes
of Siva reappearing under a hardly modified form in the cherubs of the
Talmudistic Jews, as we have traced the bull Apis in the sphinxes or
cherubs of the Mosaic Ark; and as we find it several thousand years
later in the company of one of the Christian evangelists, Luke.</p>

<p>Whoever has lived in India long enough to acquaint himself even
superficially with the native deities, must detect the similarity between
Jehovah and other gods besides Siva. As Saturn, the latter was
always held in great respect by the Talmudists. He was held in
reverence by the Alexandrian kabalists as the direct inspirer of the law
and the prophets; one of the names of Saturn was Israel, and we will
show, in time, his identity in a certain way with Abram, which Movers and
others hinted at long since. Thus it cannot be wondered at if Valentinus,
Basilides, and the Ophite Gnostics placed the dwelling of their
Ilda-Baoth, also a destroyer as well as a creator, in the planet Saturn;
for it was he who gave the law in the wilderness and spoke through the
prophets. If more proof should be required we will show it in the testimony
of the canonical <cite>Bible</cite> itself. In <cite>Amos</cite> the “Lord” pours vials
of wrath upon the people of Israel. He rejects their burnt-offerings and
will not listen to their prayers, but inquires of Amos, “have ye offered
unto <i>me</i> sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of
Israel?” “But ye have borne the tabernacles of your Moloch and
<i>Chiun</i> your images, the <em>star of your god</em>” (<abbr title="verses">v.</abbr> 25, 26). Who are Moloch
and <i>Chiun</i> but Baal—Saturn—Siva, and <i>Chiun</i>, Kivan, the same Saturn
whose star the Israelites had made to themselves? There seems no
escape in this case; all these deities are identical.</p>

<p>The same in the case of the numerous Logoï. While the Zoroastrian
Sosiosh is framed on that of the tenth Brahmanical Avatar, and the fifth
Buddha of the followers of Gautama; and we find the former, after having
passed part and parcel into the kabalistic system of king Messiah, reflected
in the Apostle Gabriel of the Nazarenes, and Æbel-Zivo, the
Legatus, sent on earth by the Lord of Celsitude and Light; all of these—Hindu

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>

and Persian, Buddhist and Jewish, the Christos of the Gnostics
and the Philonean Logos—are found combined in “the Word made
flesh” of the fourth <cite>Gospel</cite>. Christianity includes all these systems,
patched and arranged to meet the occasion. Do we take up the <cite>Avesta</cite>—we
find there the dual system so prevalent in the Christian scheme.
The struggle between
 <span class="lock">Ahriman,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_468" id="FNanchor_468">[468]</a></span>
 Darkness, and Ormazd, Light, has been
going on in the world continually since the beginning of time. When the
worst arrives and Ahriman will seem to have conquered the world and
corrupted all mankind, <em>then will appear the Saviour</em> of mankind, Sosiosh.
He will come seated upon a white horse and followed by an army of good
genii equally mounted on milk-white
 <span class="lock">steeds.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_469" id="FNanchor_469">[469]</a></span>
 And this we find faithfully
copied in the <cite>Revelation</cite>: “I saw heaven opened, and beheld a
<em>white horse</em>; and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true....
And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses”
(<cite>Revelation</cite> <abbr title="nineteen">xix.</abbr> 11, 14).
 Sosiosh himself is but a later Persian <em>permutation</em>
of the Hindu Vishnu. The figure of this god may be found unto
this day representing him as the Saviour, the “Preserver” (the preserving
spirit of God), in the temple of Rama. The picture shows him in his
tenth incarnation—the <i>Kalki avatar</i>, which is yet to come—as an armed
warrior mounted upon a white horse. Waving over his head the sword
destruction, he holds in his other hand a discus, made up of rings encircled
in one another, an emblem of the revolving cycles or great
 <span class="lock">ages,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_470" id="FNanchor_470">[470]</a></span>
for Vishnu will thus appear but at the end of the <i>Kaliyug</i>, answering to
the end of the world expected by our Adventists. “And out of his
mouth goeth a sharp sword ... on his head were many crowns”
(<cite>Revelation</cite> <abbr title="nineteen">xix.</abbr> 12). Vishnu is often represented with several crowns
superposed on his head. “And I saw an angel standing on the Sun”
(17). The <em>white horse is the horse of the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Sun</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_471" id="FNanchor_471">[471]</a></span>
 Sosiosh, the Persian
Saviour, is also born of a
 <span class="lock">virgin,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_472" id="FNanchor_472">[472]</a></span>
 and at the end of days he will come as
a Redeemer to regenerate the world, but he will be preceded by two
prophets, who will come to announce
 <span class="lock">him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_473" id="FNanchor_473">[473]</a></span>
 Hence the Jews who had
Moses and Elias, are now waiting for the Messiah. “Then comes the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>

general <em>resurrection</em>, when the good will immediately enter into this
happy abode—the regenerated earth; and Ahriman and his angels
(the
 <span class="lock">devils),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_474" id="FNanchor_474">[474]</a></span>
 and the wicked, be purified by immersion in a lake of
molten metal.... Henceforward, all will enjoy unchangeable happiness,
and, headed by Sosiosh, ever sing the praises of the Eternal
 <span class="lock">One.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_475" id="FNanchor_475">[475]</a></span>
The above is a perfect repetition of Vishnu in his tenth avatar, for he
will then throw the wicked into the infernal abodes in which, after purifying
themselves, they will be pardoned—even those devils which rebelled
against Brahma, and were hurled into the bottomless pit by
 <span class="lock">Siva,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_476" id="FNanchor_476">[476]</a></span>
 as
also the “blessed ones” will go to dwell with the gods, over the Mount
Meru.</p>

<p>Having thus traced the similarity of views respecting the Logos, Metatron,
and Mediator, as found in the <cite>Kabala</cite> and the <cite>Codex</cite> of the Christian
Nazarenes and Gnostics, the reader is prepared to appreciate the
audacity of the Patristic scheme to reduce a purely metaphysical figure
into concrete form, and make it appear as if the finger of prophecy had
from time immemorial been pointing down the vista of ages to Jesus as
the coming Messiah. A theomythos intended to symbolize the coming
day, near the close of the great cycle, when the “glad tidings” from
heaven should proclaim the universal brotherhood and common faith of
humanity, the day of regeneration—was violently distorted into an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>“Why callest thou me good? there is none good but <em>one, that is
God</em>,” says Jesus. Is this the language of a God? of the second person
in the Trinity, who is identical with the First? And if this Messiah, or
Holy Ghost of the Gnostic and Pagan Trinities, had come in his person,
what did he mean by distinguishing between himself the “Son of man,”
and the Holy Ghost? “And whosoever shall speak a word against the
Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but unto him that blasphemeth
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven,” he
 <span class="lock">says.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_477" id="FNanchor_477">[477]</a></span>
 And how
account for the marvellous identity of this very language, with the precepts
enunciated, centuries before, by the Kabalists and the “Pagan”
initiates? The following are a few instances out of many.</p>

<p>“No one of the gods, no man or Lord, can be good, but <em>only God
alone</em>,” says
 <span class="lock">Hermes.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_478" id="FNanchor_478">[478]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>

“To be a good man is impossible, God alone possesses this privilege,”
repeats Plato, with a slight
 <span class="lock">variation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_479" id="FNanchor_479">[479]</a></span></p>

<p>Six centuries before Christ, the Chinese philosopher Confucius said
that his doctrine was simple and easy to comprehend (<cite>Lûn-yù</cite>, <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> 5,
<abbr title="Section">§</abbr> 15). To which one of his disciples added: “The doctrine of our
Master consists in having an invariable correctness of heart, and in
doing toward others as we would that they should do to
 <span class="lock">us.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_480" id="FNanchor_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<p>“Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by
 <span class="lock">miracles,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_481" id="FNanchor_481">[481]</a></span>
exclaims Peter, long after the scene of Calvary. “There was a <em>man</em> sent
from God, whose name was
 <span class="lock">John,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_482" id="FNanchor_482">[482]</a></span>
 says the fourth <cite>Gospel</cite>, thus placing
the Baptist on an equality with Jesus. John the Baptist, in one of the
most solemn acts of his life, that of baptizing Christ, thinks not that he
is going to baptize <em>a God</em>, but uses the word man. “This is he of whom
I said, after me cometh
 <span class="lock"><em>a man</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_483" id="FNanchor_483">[483]</a></span>
 Speaking of himself, Jesus says, “You
seek to kill <em>me, a man</em> that hath told you the truth, which <em>I have heard
of</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>God</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_484" id="FNanchor_484">[484]</a></span>
 Even the blind man of Jerusalem, healed by the great thaumaturgist,
full of gratitude and admiration for his benefactor, in narrating
the miracle does not call Jesus God, but simply says, “... <em>a man</em>
that is called Jesus, made
 <span class="lock">clay.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_485" id="FNanchor_485">[485]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not close the list for lack of other instances and proofs, but
simply because what we now say has been repeated and demonstrated
by others, many times before us. But there is no more incurable evil
than blind and unreasoning fanaticism. Few are the men who, like Dr.
Priestley, have the courage to write, “We find nothing like divinity
ascribed to Christ before Justin Martyr (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 141), who, from being a
philosopher, became a
 <span class="lock">Christian.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_486" id="FNanchor_486">[486]</a></span></p>

<p>Mahomet appeared nearly six hundred
 <span class="lock">years<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_487" id="FNanchor_487">[487]</a></span>
 after the presumed
deicide. The Græco-Roman world was still convulsed with religious dissensions,
withstanding all the past imperial edicts and forcible Christianization.
While the Council of Trent was disputing about the <cite>Vulgate</cite>, the
unity of God quietly superseded the trinity, and soon the Mahometans
outnumbered the Christians. Why? Because their prophet never
sought to identify himself with Allah. Otherwise, it is safe to say, he
would not have lived to see his religion flourish. Till the present day
Mahometanism has made and is now making more proselytes than Christianity.
Buddha Siddhârtha came as a simple mortal, centuries before
Christ. The religious ethics of this faith are now found to far exceed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>

in moral beauty anything ever dreamed of by the Tertullians and Augustines.</p>

<p>The true spirit of Christianity can alone be fully found in Buddhism;
partially, it shows itself in other “heathen” religions. Buddha never
made of himself a god, nor was he deified by his followers. The Buddhists
are now known to far outnumber Christians; they are enumerated
at nearly 500,000,000. While cases of conversion among Buddhists,
Brahmanists, Mahometans, and Jews become so rare as to show how sterile
are the attempts of our missionaries, atheism and materialism spread
their gangrenous ulcers and gnaw every day deeper at the very heart
of Christianity. There are no atheists among heathen populations, and
those few among the Buddhists and Brahmans who have become infected
with materialism may always be found to belong to large cities densely
thronged with Europeans, and only among educated classes. Truly says
Bishop Kidder: “Were a wise man to choose his religion from those
who profess it, perhaps Christianity would be the last religion he would
choose!”</p>

<p>In an able little pamphlet from the pen of the popular lecturer, J.
M. Peebles, M.D., the author quotes, from the London <cite>Athenæum</cite>, an
article in which are described the welfare and civilization of the inhabitants
of Yarkand and Kashgar, “who seem virtuous and happy.”
“Gracious Heavens!” fervently exclaims the honest author, who himself
was once a Universalist clergyman, “Grant to keep Christian missionaries
<em>away</em> from ‘happy’ and heathen
 <span class="lock">Tartary!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_488" id="FNanchor_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>From the earliest days of Christianity, when Paul upbraided the
<em>Church</em> of Corinth for a crime “as is not so much as named among the
Gentiles—that one should have his father’s wife;” and for their making
a pretext of the “Lord’s Supper” for <i lang="fr">debauch</i> and drunkenness
(<cite>1 Corinthians</cite>, <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 1), the profession of the name of Christ has ever been
more a pretext than the evidence of holy feeling. However, a correct
form of this verse is: “Everywhere the lewd practice among you is
heard about, such a lewd practice as is nowhere among the heathen
nations—even the having or marrying of the father’s wife.” The Persian
influence would seem to be indicated in this language. The practice
existed “nowhere among the nations,” except in Persia, where it
was esteemed especially meritorious. Hence, too, the Jewish stories of
Abraham marrying his sister, Nahor, his niece, Amram his father’s sister,
and Judah his son’s widow, whose children appear to have been legitimate.
The Aryan tribes esteemed endogamic marriages, while the
Tartars and all barbarous nations required all alliances to be exagamous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>

There was but one apostle of Jesus worthy of that name, and that
was Paul. However disfigured were his <cite>Epistles</cite> by dogmatic hands
before being admitted into the Canon, his conception of the great and
divine figure of the philosopher who died for his idea can still be traced
in his addresses to the various Gentile nations. Only, he who would
understand him better yet must study the Philonean <i>Logos</i> reflecting now
and then the Hindu <i>Sabda</i> (logos) of the Mimansa school.</p>

<p>As to the other apostles, those whose names are prefixed to the <cite>Gospels</cite>—we
cannot well believe in their veracity when we find them attributing
to their Master miracles surrounded by circumstances, recorded, if
not in the oldest books of India, at least in such as antedated Christianity,
and in the very phraseology of the traditions. Who, in his days of
simple and blind credulity, but marvelled at the touching narrative given
in the <cite>Gospels according to Mark</cite> and <cite>Luke</cite> of the resurrection of the
daughter of Jairus? Who has ever doubted its originality? And yet
the story is copied entirely from the <cite>Hari-Purana</cite>, and is recorded among
the miracles attributed to Christna. We translate it from the French
version:</p>

<p>“The King Angashuna caused the betrothal of his daughter, the
beautiful Kalavatti, with the young son of Vamadeva, the powerful King
of Antarvédi, named Govinda, to be celebrated with great pomp.</p>

<p>“But as Kalavatti was amusing herself in the groves with her companions,
she was stung by a serpent and died. Angashuna tore his
clothes, covered himself with ashes, and cursed the day when he was
born.</p>

<p>“Suddenly, a great rumor spread through the palace, and the following
cries were heard, a thousand times repeated: ‘<cite>Pacya pitaram; pacya
gurum!</cite>’ ‘The Father, the Master!’ Then Christna approached,
smiling, leaning on the arm of Ardjuna.... ‘Master!’ cried Angashuna,
casting himself at his feet, and sprinkling them with his tears, ‘See
my poor daughter!’ and he showed him the body of Kalavatti, stretched
upon a mat....</p>

<p>“‘Why do you weep?’ replied Christna, in a gentle voice. ‘<cite>Do
you not see that she is sleeping?</cite> Listen to the sound of her breathing,
like the sigh of the night wind which rustles the leaves of the trees.
See, her cheeks resuming their color, her eyes, whose lids tremble as if
they were about to open; her lips quiver as if about to speak; she is
sleeping, I tell you; and hold! see, she moves, <em>Kalavatti! Rise and
walk!</em>’</p>

<p>“Hardly had Christna spoken, when the breathing, warmth, movement,
and life returned little by little, into the corpse, and the young
girl, obeying the injunction of the demi-god, rose from her couch and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>

rejoined her companions. But the crowd marvelled and cried out:
‘This is a god, since death is no more for him than
 <span class="lock">sleep?’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_489" id="FNanchor_489">[489]</a></span></p>

<p>All such parables are enforced upon Christians, with the addition of
dogmas which, in their extraordinary character, leave far behind them the
wildest conceptions of heathenism. The Christians, in order to believe
in a Deity, have found it necessary to kill their God, that they themselves
should live!</p>

<p>And now, the Supreme, unknown one, the Father of grace and
mercy, and his celestial hierarchy are managed by the Church as though
they were so many theatrical stars and supernumeraries under salary! Six
centuries before the Christian era, Xenophones had disposed of such
anthropomorphism by an immortal satire, recorded and preserved by
Clement of Alexandria:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent9">“There is one God Supreme ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whose form is not like unto man’s, and as unlike his nature;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But vain mortals imagine that gods like themselves are begotten</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With human sensations, and voice, and corporeal members;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So if oxen or lions had hands and could work in man’s fashion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And trace out with chisel or brush their conception of Godhead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then would horses depict gods like horses, and oxen like oxen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Each kind the Divine with its own form and nature endowing.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_490" id="FNanchor_490">[490]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And hear Vyasa—the poet-pantheist of India, who, for all the
scientists can prove, may have lived, as Jacolliot has it, some fifteen
thousand years ago—discoursing on Maya, the illusion of the senses:</p>

<p>“All religious dogmas only serve to obscure the intelligence of
man.... Worship of divinities, under the allegories of which is hidden
respect for natural laws, drives away truth to the profit of the basest
superstitions” (<cite>Vyasa Maya</cite>).</p>

<p>It was given to Christianity to paint us God Almighty after the model
of the kabalistic abstraction of the “Ancient of Days.” From old
frescos on cathedral ceilings; Catholic missals, and other icons and
images, we now find him depicted by the poetic brush of Gustave Doré.
The awful, unknown majesty of Him, whom no “heathen” dared to
reproduce in concrete form, is figuring in our own century in <cite>Doré’s
Illustrated Bible</cite>. Treading upon clouds that float in mid-air, darkness
and chaos behind him and the world beneath his feet, a majestic old
man stands, his left hand gathering his flowing robes about him, and his
right raised in the gesture of command. He has spoken the Word, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>

from his towering person streams an effulgence of Light—the Shekinah.
As a poetic conception, the composition does honor to the artist, but
does it honor God? Better, the chaos behind Him, than the figure
itself; for there, at least, we have a solemn mystery. For our part, we
prefer the silence of the ancient heathens. With such a gross, anthropomorphic,
and, as we conceive, blasphemous representation of the First
Cause, who can feel surprised at any iconographic extravagance in the representation
of the Christian Christ, the apostles, and the putative Saints?
With the Catholics <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter becomes quite naturally the janitor of
Heaven, and sits at the door of the celestial kingdom—a ticket-taker to
the Trinity!</p>

<p>In a religious disturbance which recently occurred in one of the
Spanish-American provinces, there were found upon the bodies of some
of the killed, passports signed by the Bishop of the Diocese and
addressed to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter; bidding him “<cite>admit the bearer as a true son of
the Church</cite>.” It was subsequently ascertained that these unique documents
were issued by the Catholic prelate just before his deluded
parishioners went into the fight at the instigation of their priests.</p>

<p>In their immoderate desire to find evidence for the authenticity of
the <cite>New Testament</cite>, the best men, the most erudite scholars even among
Protestant divines, but too often fall into deplorable traps. We cannot
believe that such a learned commentator as Canon Westcott could have
left himself in ignorance as to Talmudistic and purely kabalistic
writings. How then is it that we find him quoting, with such serene
assurance as presenting “striking analogies to the <cite>Gospel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John</cite>,”
passages from the work of <cite>The Pastor of Hermas</cite>, which are complete
sentences from the kabalistic literature? “The view which Hermas
gives of Christ’s nature and work is no less harmonious with apostolic
doctrine, and it offers striking analogies to the <cite>Gospel of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John</cite>....
He (Jesus) is a rock higher than the mountains, able to hold
the whole world, ancient, and yet having a new gate!... He is
older than creation, so that he took counsel with the Father about the
creation which he made.... No one shall enter in unto him otherwise
than by his
 <span class="lock">Son.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_491" id="FNanchor_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>Now while—as the author of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite> well proves—there

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>

is nothing in this which looks like a corroboration of the doctrine taught
in the fourth gospel, he omits to state that nearly everything expressed
by the pseudo-Hermas in relation to his parabolic conversation with the
“Lord” is a plain quotation, with repeated variations, from the <cite>Sohar</cite>
and other kabalistic books. We may as well compare, so as to leave
the reader in no difficulty to judge for himself.</p>

<p>“God,” says Hermas, “planted the vineyard, that is, He created the
people and gave them to His Son; and the Son ... himself cleansed
their sins, etc.;” <i>i.e.</i>, the Son washed them in his blood, in commemoration
of which Christians drink wine at the communion. In the <cite>Kabala</cite>
it is shown that the Aged of the Aged, or “<i>Long-Face</i>,” plants a vineyard,
the latter typifying mankind; and a vine, meaning Life. The
Spirit of “<em>King</em> Messiah” is, therefore, shown as washing his garments
in <em>the wine</em> from above, from the creation of the
 <span class="lock">world.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_492" id="FNanchor_492">[492]</a></span>
 Adam, or
A-Dam is “blood.” The life of the flesh is in the blood (nephesh—soul),
<cite>Leviticus</cite> <abbr title="seventeen">xvii.</abbr> And Adam-Kadmon is the Only-Begotten. Noah also
plants a vineyard—the allegorical hot-bed of future humanity. As a consequence
of the adoption of the same allegory, we find it reproduced in
the Nazarene <cite>Codex</cite>. Seven vines are procreated, which spring from
Iukabar Ziva, and Ferho (or Parcha) Raba waters
 <span class="lock">them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_493" id="FNanchor_493">[493]</a></span>
 When the
blessed will ascend among the creatures of Light, they shall see Iavar-Zivo,
<em>Lord of</em> <span class="smcap">Life</span>, and the First
 <span class="lock"><span class="smcap">Vine</span>!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_494" id="FNanchor_494">[494]</a></span>
 These kabalistic metaphora
are thus naturally repeated in the <cite>Gospel according to John</cite> (<abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 1): “I
am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.” In <cite>Genesis</cite> (<abbr title="forty-nine">xlix.</abbr> ),
the dying Jacob is made to say, “The sceptre shall not depart from
Judah (the lion’s whelp), nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh
(Siloh) comes.... Binding his colt unto <em>the vine</em>, and his ass’s colt unto
the choice vine, he washed his garments <em>in wine</em>, and his clothes <em>in the
blood of grapes</em>.” Shiloh is “King Messiah,” as well as the Shiloh in
Ephraim, which was to be made the capital and the place of the sanctuary.
In <cite>The Targum of Onkelos</cite>, the Babylonian, the words of Jacob
read: “Until the <em>King Messiah</em> shall come.” The prophecy has failed
in the Christian as well as in the kabalistico-Jewish sense. The sceptre
has departed from Judah, whether the Messiah has already or will come,
unless we believe, with the kabalists, that Moses was the first Messiah,
who transferred his soul to
 <span class="lock">Joshua—Jesus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_495" id="FNanchor_495">[495]</a></span></p>

<p>Says Hermas: “And, in the middle of the plain, he showed me a
great <em>white</em> rock, which had risen out of the plain, and the rock was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>

higher than the mountains, rectangular, so as to be able to hold the whole
world; but that rock was old, having a gate hewn out of it, and the hewing
out of the gate seemed to me to be recent.” In the <cite>Sohar</cite>, we
find: “To 40,000 superior worlds the <em>white</em> of the skull of His Head
(of the most Sacred Ancient <i lang="la">in absconditus</i>) is

 When
<i>Seir</i> (the first reflection and image of his Father, the Ancient of the Ancient)
will, through the mystery of the seventy names of Metatron, descend
into Iezirah (the third world), he will open a new gate.... The
Spiritus Decisorius will cut and divide the garment (Shekinah) into two
 <span class="lock">parts.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_497" id="FNanchor_497">[497]</a></span> ... At the coming of King Messiah, from the sacred cubical
stone of the Temple a <em>white light</em> will be arising during forty days. This
will expand, until <em>it encloses the whole world</em>.... At that time King
Messiah will allow himself to be revealed, and will be seen coming out
of the gate of the garden of Odan (Eden). ‘He will be revealed in the
land
 <span class="lock">Galil.’<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_498" id="FNanchor_498">[498]</a></span> ... When ‘he has made satisfaction for the sins of
Israel, he will lead them on through a <em>new gate</em> to the seat of judgment.’<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_499" id="FNanchor_499">[499]</a>
At the <em>Gate of the House of Life</em>, the throne is prepared for
the Lord of <span class="lock">Splendor.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_500" id="FNanchor_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>Further on, the commentator introduces the following quotation:
“This <em>rock</em> and this <em>gate</em> are the Son of God. ‘How, Lord,’ I said, ‘is
the rock old and the gate new?’ ‘Listen,’ He said, ‘and understand,
thou ignorant man. The <em>Son of God is older than all of his creation</em>, so
that he was a Councillor with the Father in His works of creation; and
for this is he
 <span class="lock">old.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_501" id="FNanchor_501">[501]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, these two assertions are not only purely kabalistic, without
even so much as a change of expression, but Brahmanical and Pagan
likewise. “<i lang="la">Vidi virum excellentem cœli terræque conditore natu majorem.</i>...
I have seen the most excellent (superior) <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>, who is older by birth
than the maker of heaven and earth,” says the kabalistic
 <span class="lock"><cite>Codex</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_502" id="FNanchor_502">[502]</a></span>
 The
Eleusinian Dionysus, whose particular name was <i>Iacchos</i> (Iaccho, Iahoh)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_503" id="FNanchor_503">[503]</a>—the
God from whom the liberation of souls was expected—was considered
older than the Demiurge. At the mysteries of the Anthesteria at
the lakes (the Limnæ), after the usual baptism by purification of water,
the <i>Mystæ</i> were made to pass through to another door (gate), and one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
particularly for that purpose, which was called “the gate of Dionysus,”
and that of “the <em>purified</em>.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Sohar</cite>, the kabalists are told that the work-master, the Demiurge,
said to the Lord: “Let us make man after our
 <span class="lock">image.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_504" id="FNanchor_504">[504]</a></span>
 In the
original texts of the first chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite>, it stands: “And the <i>Elohim</i>
(translated as the Supreme God), who are the highest gods or powers,
said: Let us make man in <i>our</i> (?) image, after <em>our</em> likeness.” In the
<cite>Vedas</cite>, Brahma holds counsel with Parabrahma, as to the best mode to
proceed to create the world.</p>

<p>Canon Westcott, quoting Hermas, shows him asking: “And why is
the gate <em>new</em>, Lord? I said. ‘Because,’ he replied, ‘he was manifested
at the last of the days of the dispensation; for this cause the gate was
made new, in order that they who shall be saved might enter by it into
the Kingdom of
 <span class="lock">God.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_505" id="FNanchor_505">[505]</a></span>
 There are two peculiarities worthy of note
in this passage. To begin with, it attributes to “the Lord” a false statement
of the same character as that so emphasized by the Apostle John;
and which brought, at a later period, the whole of the orthodox Christians,
who accepted the apostolic allegories as literal, to such inconvenient
straits. Jesus, as Messiah, was <em>not</em> manifested at the last of the
days; for the latter are yet to come, notwithstanding a number of divinely-inspired
prophecies, followed by disappointed hopes, as a result, to testify
to his immediate coming. The belief that the “last times” had come,
was natural, when once the coming of King Messiah had been acknowledged.
The second peculiarity is found in the fact that the <em>prophecy</em> could
have been accepted at all, when even its approximate determination
is a direct contradiction of Mark, who makes Jesus distinctly state
that neither the angels, nor the Son himself, know of that day or that
 <span class="lock">hour.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_506" id="FNanchor_506">[506]</a></span>
 We might add that, as the belief undeniably originated with the
<cite>Apocalypse</cite>, it ought to be a self-evident proof that it belonged to the
calculations peculiar to the kabalists and the Pagan sanctuaries. It was
the secret computation of a cycle, which, according to their reckoning,
was ending toward the latter part of the first century. It may also be
held as a corroborative proof, that the <cite>Gospel according to Mark</cite>, as well
as that ascribed to <cite>John</cite>, and the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>, were written by men,
of whom neither was sufficiently acquainted with the other. The Logos
was first definitely called <i>petra</i> (rock) by Philo; the word, moreover, as
we have shown elsewhere, means, in Chaldaic and Phœnician, “interpreter.”
Justin Martyr calls him, throughout his works, “angel,” and
makes a clear distinction between the Logos and God the Creator.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>

“The Word of God is His Son ... and he is also called Angel and
Apostle, for he declares whatever we ought to know (interprets), and is
sent to declare whatever is
 <span class="lock">disclosed.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_507" id="FNanchor_507">[507]</a></span></p>

<p>“Adan Inferior is distributed into its own paths, into thirty-two sides
of paths, yet it is not known to any one but <i>Seir</i>. But no one knows
the <span class="smcap">Superior Adan</span> nor His paths, except that Long Face”—the
Supreme
 <span class="lock">God.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_508" id="FNanchor_508">[508]</a></span>
 Seir is the Nazarene “genius,” who is called Æbel
Zivo; and Gabriel Legatus—also “Apostle
 <span class="lock">Gabriel.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_509" id="FNanchor_509">[509]</a></span>
 The Nazarenes
held with the kabalists that even the Messiah who was to come did not
know the “<em>Superior</em> Adan,” the concealed Deity; no one except the
<em>Supreme</em> God; thus showing that above the Supreme Intelligible Deity,
there is one still more secret and unrevealed. Seir-Anpin is the third
God, while “Logos,” according to Philo Judæus, is the second one.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_510" id="FNanchor_510">[510]</a>
This is distinctly shown in the <cite>Codex</cite>. The false Messiah shall say:
“I am Deus, son of Deus; my Father sent me here.... I am the first
<em>Legate</em>, I am Æbel Zivo, I am come from on high! But distrust him;
for he will not be Æbel Zivo. Æbel Zivo will not permit himself to be
seen in this
 <span class="lock">age.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_511" id="FNanchor_511">[511]</a></span>
 Hence the belief of some Gnostics that it was not
Æbel Zivo (Archangel Gabriel) who “<em>overshadowed</em>” Mary, but Ilda-Baoth,
who formed the <em>material body</em> of Jesus; <em>Christos</em> uniting himself
with him only at the moment of baptism in the Jordan.</p>

<p>Can we doubt Nork’s assertion that “the Bereshith Rabba, the oldest
part of the Midrash Rabboth, <em>was known to the Church Fathers in a
Greek</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>translation</em>?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_512" id="FNanchor_512">[512]</a></span></p>

<p>But if, on the one hand, they were sufficiently acquainted with the
different religious systems of their neighbors to have enabled them to
build a new religion alleged to be distinct from all others, their ignorance
of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> itself, let alone the more complicated questions
of Grecian metaphysics, is now found to have been deplorable.
“So, for instance, in <cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="twenty-seven">xxvii.</abbr>
 9 f., the passage from <cite>Zechariah</cite>
<abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr> 12, 13, is attributed to Jeremiah,” says the author of <cite>Supernatural
Religion</cite>. “In <cite>Mark</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 2,
 a quotation from <cite>Malachi</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 1, is ascribed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>

to Isaiah. In <cite>1 Corinthians</cite>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 9, a passage is quoted as <cite>Holy
Scripture</cite>, which is not found in the <cite>Old Testament</cite> at all, but which is
taken, as Origen and Jerome state, from an apocryphal work, <cite>The Revelation
of Elias</cite> (Origen: <cite>Tract.</cite> <abbr title="thirty-five">xxxv.</abbr>), and the passage is similarly
quoted by the so-called <cite>Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians</cite> (<abbr title="thirty-four">xxxiv.</abbr>)”.
How reliable are the pious Fathers in their explanations of divers heresies
may be illustrated in the case of Epiphanius, who mistook the
Pythagorean sacred Tetrad, called in the Valentinian <i>Gnosis</i>, Kol-Arbas,
for a <em>heretic</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>leader</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_513" id="FNanchor_513">[513]</a></span>
 What with the involuntary blunders, and deliberate
falsifications of the teachings of those who differed in views with
them; the canonization of the mythological Aura Placida (gentle
breeze), into a pair of Christian martyrs—<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Aura and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Placida;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_514" id="FNanchor_514">[514]</a>
the deification of a <em>spear</em> and a <em>cloak</em>, under the names of <abbr title="Saints">SS.</abbr> Longimus
and
 <span class="lock">Amphibolus;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_515" id="FNanchor_515">[515]</a></span>
 and the Patristic quotations from prophets, of what
was never in those prophets at all; one may well ask in blank amazement
whether the so-called religion of Christ has ever been other than
an incoherent dream, since the death of the Great Master.</p>

<p>So malicious do we find the holy Fathers in their unrelenting persecution
of pretended
 <span class="lock">“<em>hæresies</em>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_516" id="FNanchor_516">[516]</a></span>
 that we see them telling, without hesitation
the most preposterous untruths, and inventing entire narratives,
the better to impress their own otherwise unsupported arguments upon
ignorance. If the mistake in relation to the tetrad had at first originated
as a simple consequence of an unpremeditated blunder of Hippolytus,
the explanations of Epiphanius and others who fell into the same
absurd
 <span class="lock">error<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_517" id="FNanchor_517">[517]</a></span>
 have a less innocent look. When Hippolytus gravely
denounces the great heresy of the Tetrad, Kol-Arbas, and states that
the imaginary Gnostic leader is, “Kalorbasus, who endeavors to explain

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span>

religion by measures and
 <span class="lock">numbers,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_518" id="FNanchor_518">[518]</a></span>
 we may simply smile. But when
Epiphanius, with abundant indignation, elaborates upon the theme,
“which is Heresy <abbr title="Fifteen">XV.</abbr>,” and pretending to be thoroughly acquainted with
the subject, adds: “A certain Heracleon follows after Colorbasus,
which is Heresy
 <span class="lock"><abbr title="Sixteen">XVI.</abbr>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_519" id="FNanchor_519">[519]</a></span>
 then he lays himself open to the charge of
deliberate falsification.</p>

<p>If this zealous <em>Christian</em> can boast so unblushingly of having caused
“<em>by his information</em> seventy women, even of rank, to be sent into exile,
<em>through the seductions of some</em> in whose number he had himself been
drawn into joining their sect,” he has left us a fair standard by which to
judge him. C. W. King remarks, very aptly, on this point, that “it may
reasonably be suspected that this worthy renegade had in this case saved
himself from the fate of his fellow-religionists by turning evidence against
them, on the opening of the
 <span class="lock">persecution.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_520" id="FNanchor_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus, one by one, perished the Gnostics, the only heirs to whose
share had fallen a few stray crumbs of the unadulterated truth of primitive
Christianity. All was confusion and turmoil during these first centuries,
till the moment when all these contradictory dogmas were finally forced
upon the Christian world, and examination was forbidden. For long ages
it was made a sacrilege, punishable with severe penalties, often death, to
seek to comprehend that which the Church had so conveniently elevated
to the rank of <em>divine</em> mystery. But since biblical critics have taken upon
themselves to “set the house in order,” the cases have become reversed.
Pagan creditors now come from every part of the globe to claim their
own, and Christian theology begins to be suspected of complete bankruptcy.
Such is the sad result of the fanaticism of the “orthodox” sects,
who, to borrow an expression of the author of “The Decline and Fall of
the Roman Empire,” never were, like the Gnostics, “the most polite, the
most learned, and most wealthy of the Christian name.” And, if not all
of them “smelt garlic,” as Renan will have it, on the other hand, none
of these Christian saints have ever shrunk from spilling their neighbor’s
blood, if the views of the latter did not agree with their own.</p>

<p>And so all our philosophers were swept away by the ignorant and
superstitious masses. The Philaletheians, the lovers of truth, and their
eclectic school, perished; and there, where the young Hypatia had taught
the highest philosophical doctrines; and where Ammonius Saccas had
explained that “the <em>whole which Christ had in view</em> was to reinstate and
restore to its primitive integrity the wisdom of the ancients—to reduce

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>

within bounds the universally prevailing dominion of superstition ...
and to exterminate the various errors that had found their way into the
different popular
 <span class="lock">religions”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_521" id="FNanchor_521">[521]</a>—there,</span>
 we say, freely raved the οι πολλοι of
Christianity. No more precepts from the mouth of the “God-taught
philosopher,” but others expounded by the incarnation of a most cruel,
fiendish superstition.</p>

<p>“If thy father,” wrote <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, “lies down across thy threshold, if
thy mother uncovers to thine eyes the bosom which suckled thee, trample
on thy father’s lifeless body, trample on thy mother’s bosom, and, with
eyes unmoistened and dry, fly to the Lord who calleth thee!!”</p>

<p>This sentence is equalled, if not outrivalled, by this other, pronounced
in a like spirit. It emanates from another father of the early Church, the
eloquent Tertullian, who hopes to see all the “philosophers” in the
gehenna fire of Hell. “What shall be the magnitude of that scene!...
How shall I laugh! How shall I rejoice! How shall I triumph when I
see so many illustrious kings who were said to have mounted into heaven,
groaning with Jupiter, their god, in the lowest darkness of hell! Then
shall the soldiers who have persecuted the name of Christ burn in more
cruel fire than any they had kindled for the
 <span class="lock">saints!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_522" id="FNanchor_522">[522]</a></span></p>

<p>These murderous expressions illustrate the spirit of Christianity till
this day. But do they illustrate the teachings of Christ? By no means.
As Eliphas Levi says, “The God in the name of whom we would trample
on our mother’s bosom we must see in the hereafter, a hell gaping widely
at his feet, and an exterminating sword in his hand.... Moloch burned
children but a few seconds; it was reserved to the disciples of a god who
is alleged to have died to redeem humanity on the cross, to create a new
Moloch whose burning stake is
 <span class="lock">eternal!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_523" id="FNanchor_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<p>That this spirit of true Christian love has safely crossed nineteen centuries
and rages now in America, is fully instanced in the case of the rabid
Moody, the revivalist, who exclaims: “I have a son, and no one but
God knows how I love him; but I would see those beautiful eyes dug out
of his head to-night, rather than see him grow up to manhood and go
down to the grave without Christ and without hope!!”</p>

<p>To this an American paper, of Chicago, very justly responds: “This
is the spirit of the inquisition, which we are told is dead. If Moody in
his zeal would ‘dig out’ the eyes of his darling son, to what lengths may
he not go with the sons of others, whom he may love less? It is the
spirit of Loyola, gibbering in the nineteenth century, and prevented from
lighting the fagot flame and heating red-hot the instruments of torture
only by the arm of law.”</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> must not forget that the Christian Church owes its present canonical
<cite>Gospels</cite>, and hence its whole religious dogmatism, to the <cite>Sortes
Sanctorum</cite>. Unable to agree as to which were the most divinely-inspired
of the numerous gospels extant in its time, the mysterious Council of Nicea
concluded to leave the decision of the puzzling question to miraculous
intervention. This Nicean Council may well be called mysterious.
There was a mystery, first, in the mystical number of its 318 bishops, on
which Barnabas (<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 11, 12, 13) lays such a stress; added to this, there
is no agreement among ancient writers as to the time and place of its
assembly, nor even as to the bishop who presided. Notwithstanding
the grandiloquent eulogium of
 <span class="lock">Constantine,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_524" id="FNanchor_524">[524]</a></span>
 Sabinus, the Bishop of
Heraclea, affirms that “except Constantine, the emperor, and Eusebius
Pamphilus, these bishops were a set of <em>illiterate, simple</em> creatures, that
understood nothing;” which is equivalent to saying that they were a set
of fools. Such was apparently the opinion entertained of them by Pappus,
who tells us of the bit of magic resorted to to decide which were the
<em>true</em> gospels. In his <cite>Synodicon</cite> to that Council Pappus says, having
“promiscuously put all the books that were referred to the Council for
determination under a communion-table in a church, they (the bishops)
besought the Lord that the <em>inspired</em> writings might get upon the table,
while the spurious ones remained underneath, and <em>it happened accordingly</em>.”
But we are not told who kept the keys of the council chamber
over night!</p>

<p>On the authority of ecclesiastical eye-witnesses, therefore, we are at
liberty to say that the Christian world owes its “Word of God” to a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>

method of divination, for resorting to which the Church subsequently
condemned unfortunate victims as conjurers, enchanters, magicians,
witches, and vaticinators, and burnt them by thousands! In treating of
this truly divine phenomenon of the self-sorting manuscripts, the Fathers of
the Church say that God himself presides over the <cite>Sortes</cite>. As we have
shown elsewhere, Augustine confesses that he himself used this sort of
divination. But opinions, like revealed religions, are liable to change.
That which for nearly fifteen hundred years was imposed on Christendom
as a book, of which every word was written under the direct supervision
of the Holy Ghost; of which not a syllable, nor a comma could be
changed without sacrilege, is now being retranslated, revised, corrected,
and clipped of whole verses, in some cases of entire chapters. And
yet, as soon as the new edition is out, its doctors would have us accept
it as a new “Revelation” of the nineteenth century, with the alternative
of being held as an infidel. Thus, we see that, no more <em>within</em> than
<em>without</em> its precincts, is the infallible Church to be trusted more than
would be reasonably convenient. The forefathers of our modern divines
found authority for the <cite>Sortes</cite> in the verse where it is said: “The lot
is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the
 <span class="lock">Lord;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_525" id="FNanchor_525">[525]</a></span>
and now, their direct heirs hold that “the whole disposing thereof is of
the Devil.” Perhaps, they are unconsciously beginning to endorse the
doctrine of the Syrian Bardesanes, that the actions of God, as well as of
man, <em>are subject to necessity</em>?</p>

<p>It was no doubt, also, according to strict “necessity” that the Neo-platonists
were so summarily dealt with by the Christian mob. In those
days, the doctrines of the Hindu naturalists and antediluvian Pyrrhonists
were forgotten, if they ever had been known at all, to any but a few
philosophers; and Mr. Darwin, with his modern <em>discoveries</em>, had not even
been mentioned in the prophecies. In this case the law of the survival
of the fittest was reversed; the <em>Neo-platonists were doomed to destruction
from the day when they openly sided with Aristotle</em>.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the fourth century crowds began gathering at the
door of the academy where the learned and unfortunate Hypatia expounded
the doctrines of the divine Plato and Plotinus, and thereby impeded
the progress of Christian proselytism. She too successfully dispelled the
mist hanging over the religious “mysteries” invented by the Fathers,
not to be considered dangerous. This alone would have been sufficient
to imperil both herself and her followers. It was precisely the teachings

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>

of this Pagan philosopher, which had been so freely borrowed by the Christians
to give a finishing touch to their otherwise incomprehensible
scheme, that had seduced so many into joining the new religion; and
now the Platonic light began shining so inconveniently bright upon
the pious patchwork, as to allow every one to see whence the
“revealed” doctrines were derived. But there was a still greater peril.
Hypatia had studied under Plutarch, the head of the Athenian school,
and had learned all the secrets of theurgy. While she lived to instruct
the multitude, no <em>divine</em> miracles could be produced before one who
could divulge the natural causes by which they took place. Her doom
was sealed by Cyril, whose eloquence she eclipsed, and whose authority,
built on degrading superstitions, had to yield before hers, which was
erected on the rock of immutable natural law. It is more than curious
that Cave, the author of the <cite>Lives of the Fathers</cite>, should find it incredible
that Cyril sanctioned her murder on account of his “general character.”
A saint who will sell the gold and silver vessels of his church, and
then, after spending the money, lie at his trial, as he did, may well be suspected
of anything. Besides, in this case, the Church had to fight for
her life, to say nothing of her future supremacy. Alone, the hated and
erudite Pagan scholars, and the no less learned Gnostics, held in their
doctrines the hitherto concealed wires of all these theological marionettes.
Once the curtain should be lifted, the connection between the
old Pagan and the new Christian religions would be exposed; and then,
what would have become of the Mysteries into which it is sin and blasphemy
to pry? With such a coincidence of the astronomical allegories
of various Pagan myths with the dates adopted by Christianity for the
nativity, crucifixion, and resurrection, and such an identity of rites and ceremonies,
what would have been the fate of the new religion, had not the
Church, under the pretext of serving Christ, got rid of the too-well-informed
philosophers? To guess what, if the <i lang="fr">coup d’état</i> had then
failed, might have been the prevailing religion in our own century would
indeed, be a hard task. But, in all probability, the state of things
which made of the middle ages a period of intellectual darkness, which
degraded the nations of the Occident, and lowered the European of those
days almost to the level of a Papuan savage—could not have occurred.</p>

<p>The fears of the Christians were but too well founded, and their
pious zeal and prophetic insight was rewarded from the very first. In
the demolition of the Serapeum, after the bloody riot between the
Christian mob and the Pagan worshippers had ended with the interference
of the emperor, a Latin cross, of a perfect Christian shape, was discovered
hewn upon the granite slabs of the adytum. This was a lucky discovery,
indeed; and the monks did not fail to claim that the cross had

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>

been hallowed by the Pagans in a “spirit of prophecy.” At least, Sozomen,
with an air of triumph, records the
 <span class="lock">fact.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_526" id="FNanchor_526">[526]</a></span>
 But, archæology and
symbolism, those tireless and implacable enemies of clerical false pretences,
have found in the hieroglyphics of the legend running around the
design, at least a partial interpretation of its meaning.</p>

<p>According to King and other numismatists and archæologists, the
cross was placed there as the symbol of eternal life. Such a Tau, or
Egyptian cross, was used in the Bacchic and Eleusinian Mysteries. Symbol
of the dual generative power, it was laid upon the breast of the initiate,
after his “new birth” was accomplished, and the Mystæ had returned
from their baptism in the sea. It was a mystic sign that his spiritual
birth had regenerated and united his astral soul with his divine spirit,
and that he was ready to ascend in spirit to the blessed abodes of light
and glory—the Eleusinia. The Tau was a magic talisman at the same
time as a religious emblem. It was adopted by the Christians through
the Gnostics and kabalists, who used it largely, as their numerous gems
testify, and who had the Tau (or handled cross) from the Egyptians, and
the Latin cross from the Buddhist missionaries, who brought it from India,
where it can be found until now, two or three centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The
Assyrians, Egyptians, ancient Americans, Hindus, and Romans had it in
various, but very slight modifications of shape. Till very late in the
mediæval ages, it was considered a potent spell against epilepsy and
demoniacal possession; and the “signet of the living God,” brought down
in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s vision by the angel ascending from the east to “seal the
servants of our God in their foreheads,” was but the same mystic Tau—the
Egyptian cross. In the painted glass of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dionysus (France), this
angel is represented as stamping this sign on the forehead of the elect;
the legend reads, <span class="allsmcap">SIGNVM</span> ΤΑΥ. In King’s <cite>Gnostics</cite>, the author reminds
us that “this mark is commonly born by <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anthony, an <em>Egyptian</em>
 <span class="lock">recluse.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_527" id="FNanchor_527">[527]</a></span>
 What the real meaning of the Tau was, is explained to us by
the Christian <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, the Egyptian Hermes, and the Hindu Brahmans.
It is but too evident that, with the apostle, at least, it meant the “Ineffable
Name,” as he calls this “signet of the living God,” a few chapters
further
 <span class="lock">on,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_528" id="FNanchor_528">[528]</a></span>
 the “<em>Father’s name written in their foreheads</em>.”</p>

<p>The Brahmâtma, the chief of the Hindu initiates, had on his head-gear
two keys, symbol of the revealed mystery of life and death, placed cross-like;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>

and, in some Buddhist pagodas of Tartary and Mongolia, the
entrance of a chamber within the temple, generally containing the staircase
which leads to the inner
 <span class="lock">daghôba,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_529" id="FNanchor_529">[529]</a></span>
 and the porticos of some
 <span class="lock"><i>Prachida</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_530" id="FNanchor_530">[530]</a></span>
are ornamented with a cross formed of two fishes, and as found
on some of the zodiacs of the Buddhists. We should not wonder at all
at learning that the sacred device in the tombs in the Catacombs, at Rome,
the “Vesica piscis,” was derived from the said Buddhist zodiacal sign.
How general must have been that geometrical figure in the world-symbols,
may be inferred from the fact that there is a Masonic tradition that
Solomon’s temple was built on three foundations, forming the “triple
Tau,” or three crosses.</p>

<p>In its mystical sense, the Egyptian cross owes its origin, as an emblem,
to the realization by the earliest philosophy of an androgynous
dualism of every manifestation in nature, which proceeds from the abstract
ideal of a likewise androgynous deity, while the Christian emblem is
simply due to chance. Had the Mosaic law prevailed, Jesus should have
been
 <span class="lock">lapidated.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_531" id="FNanchor_531">[531]</a></span>
 The crucifix was an instrument of torture, and utterly
common among Romans as it was unknown among Semitic nations.
It was called the “Tree of Infamy.” It is but later that it was adopted
as a Christian symbol; but, during the first two decades, the apostles
looked upon it with
 <span class="lock">horror.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_532" id="FNanchor_532">[532]</a></span>
 It is certainly not the Christian Cross that
John had in mind when speaking of the “signet of the living God,” but
the <em>mystic</em> Tau—the Tetragrammaton, or mighty name, which, on the
most ancient kabalistic talismans, was represented by the four Hebrew
letters composing the Holy Word.</p>

<p>The famous Lady Ellenborough, known among the Arabs of Damascus,
and in the desert, after her last marriage, as <i>Hanoum Medjouyé</i>, had
a talisman in her possession, presented to her by a Druze from Mount
Lebanon. It was recognized by a certain sign on its left corner, to belong
to that class of gems which is known in Palestine as a “<em>Messianic</em>”
amulet, of the second or third century, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
 It is a green stone of a pentagonal
form; at the bottom is engraved a fish; higher, Solomon’s
 <span class="lock">seal;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_533" id="FNanchor_533">[533]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>

and still higher, the four Chaldaic letters——Jod, He, Vau, He, IAHO, which
form the name of the Deity. These are arranged in quite an unusual
way, running from below upward, in reversed order, and forming the
Egyptian Tau. Around these there is a legend which, as the gem is
not our property, we are not at liberty to give. The Tau, in its mystical
sense, as well as the <i lang="la">crux ansata</i>, is the <i>Tree of Life</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft">

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>It is well known, that the earliest Christian emblems—before it was
ever attempted to represent the bodily appearance of Jesus—were the
Lamb, the Good Shepherd, and <em>the Fish</em>. The origin of the latter emblem,
which has so puzzled the archæologists, thus becomes comprehensible.
The whole secret lies in the easily-ascertained
fact that, while in the <cite>Kabala</cite>,
the King Messiah is called “Interpreter,”
or Revealer of the mystery, and shown
to be the <em>fifth</em> emanation, in the <cite>Talmud</cite>—for
reasons we will now explain—the
Messiah is very often designated as “<span class="smcap">Dag</span>,”
or the Fish. This is an inheritance from
the Chaldees, and relates—as the very
name indicates—to the Babylonian Dagon,
the man-fish, who was the instructor and
interpreter of the people, to whom he appeared. Abarbanel explains
the name, by stating that the sign of his (Messiah’s) coming “is the conjunction
of Saturn and Jupiter in the sign
 <span class="lock"><i>Pisces</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_534" id="FNanchor_534">[534]</a></span>
 Therefore, as the
Christians were intent upon identifying their Christos with the Messiah
of the <cite>Old Testament</cite>, they adopted it so readily as to forget that its true
origin might be traced still farther back than the Babylonian Dagon.
How eagerly and closely the ideal of Jesus was united, by the early
Christians, with every imaginable kabalistic and Pagan tenet, may be
inferred from the language of Clemens, of Alexandria, addressed to his
brother co-religionists.</p>

<p>When they were debating upon the choice of the most appropriate
symbol to remind them of Jesus, Clemens advised them in the following
words: “Let the engraving upon the gem of your ring be either <em>a dove</em>,
or <em>a ship running before the wind</em> (the Argha), or <em>a fish</em>.” Was the good
father, when writing this sentence, laboring under the recollection of
Joshua, son of Nun (called <i>Jesus</i> in the Greek and Slavonian versions);
or had he forgotten the real interpretation of these Pagan symbols?

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>

Joshua, son of Nun, or Nave (<i>Navis</i>), could have with perfect propriety
adopted the image of a <em>ship</em>, or even of a fish, for Joshua means Jesus, son
of the fish-god; but it was really too hazardous to connect the emblems
of Venus, Astarte, and all the Hindu goddesses—the <i>argha</i>, <i>dove</i>, and
<i>fish</i>—with the “immaculate” birth of their god! This looks very much
as if in the early days of Christianity but little difference was made between
Christ, Bacchus, Apollo, and the Hindu Christna, the incarnation
of Vishnu, with whose first avatar this symbol of the fish originated.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Hari-purana</cite>, in the <cite>Bagaved-gitta</cite>, as well as in several other
books, the god Vishnu is shown as having assumed the form of a fish with
a human head, in order to reclaim the <cite>Vedas</cite> lost during the deluge. Having
enabled Visvamitra to escape with all his tribe in the ark, Vishnu,
pitying weak and ignorant humanity, remained with them for some time.
It was this god who taught them to build houses, cultivate the land, and to
thank the unknown Deity whom he represented, by building temples and
instituting a regular worship; and, as he remained half-fish, half-man, all
the time, at every sunset he used to return to the ocean, wherein he passed
the night.</p>

<p>“It is he,” says the sacred book, “who taught men, after the diluvium,
all that was necessary for their happiness.</p>

<p>“One day he plunged into the water and returned no more, for the
earth had covered itself again with vegetation, fruit, and cattle.</p>

<p>“But he had taught the Brahmas the secret of all things” (<cite>Hari-purana</cite>).</p>

<p>So far, we see in this narrative the <em>double</em> of the story given by the
Babylonian Berosus about Oannes, the fish-man, who is no other than
Vishnu—unless, indeed, we have to believe that it was Chaldea which
civilized India!</p>

<p>We say again, we desire to give nothing on our sole authority. Therefore
we cite Jacolliot, who, however criticised and contradicted on other
points, and however loose he may be in the matter of chronology (though
even in this he is nearer right than those scientists who would have all
Hindu books written since the Council of Nicea), at least cannot be
denied the reputation of a good Sanscrit scholar. And he says, while
analyzing the word <i>Oan</i>, or Oannes, that <i>O</i> in Sanscrit is an interjection
expressing an invocation, as O, Swayambhuva! O, God! etc; and <i>An</i>
is a radical, signifying in Sanscrit a spirit, a being; and, we presume, what
the Greeks meant by the word <i>Dæmon</i>, a semi-god.</p>

<p>“What an extraordinary antiquity,” he remarks, “this fable of Vishnu,
disguised as a fish, gives to the sacred books of the Hindus; especially
in presence of the fact that the <cite>Vedas</cite> and <cite>Manu</cite> reckon more <em>than twenty-five
thousand years of existence</em>, as proved by the most serious as the most

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>

authentic documents. Few peoples, says the learned Halhed, have their
annals more authentic or serious than the
 <span class="lock">Hindus.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_535" id="FNanchor_535">[535]</a></span></p>

<p>We may, perhaps, throw additional light upon the puzzling question of
the fish-symbol by reminding the reader that according to <cite>Genesis</cite> the first
created of living beings, the first type of animal life, was the fish. “And
the Elohim said: ‘Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that <em>hath life</em>’ ... and God created great whales ... and the
morning and the evening were the <em>fifth day</em>.” Jonah is swallowed by a
big fish, and is cast out again three days later. This the Christians regard
as a premonition of the three days’ sepulture of Jesus which preceded his
resurrection—though the statement of the three days is as fanciful as much
of the rest, and adopted to fit the well-known threat to destroy the temple
and rebuild it again in <em>three</em> days. Between his burial and alleged resurrection
there intervened but <em>one day</em>—the Jewish Sabbath—as he was
buried on Friday evening and rose to life at dawn on Sunday. However,
whatever other circumstance may be regarded as a prophecy, the story of
Jonah cannot be made to answer the purpose.</p>

<p>“Big Fish” is Cetus, the latinized form of Keto-κητω and keto is Dagon,
Poseidon, the female gender of it being Keton Atar-gatis—the Syrian
goddess, and Venus, of Askalon. The figure or bust of Der-Keto or
Astarte was generally represented on the prow of the ships. Jonah (the
Greek Iona, or <i>dove</i> sacred to Venus) fled to Jaffa, where the god Dagon,
the man-fish, was worshipped, and dared not go to Níneveh, <em>where the
dove was revered</em>. Hence, some commentators believe that when Jonah
was thrown overboard and was swallowed by a fish, we must understand
that he was picked up by one of these vessels, on the prow of which was
the figure of <i>Keto</i>. But the kabalists have another legend, to this effect:
They say that Jonah was a run-away priest from the temple of the goddess
where the dove was worshipped, and desired to abolish idolatry and institute
monotheistic worship. That, caught near Jaffa, he was held prisoner
by the devotees of Dagon in one of the prison-cells of the temple,
and that it is the strange form of the cell which gave rise to the allegory.
In the collection of Mose de Garcia, a Portuguese kabalist, there is a drawing
representing the interior of the temple of Dagon. In the middle
stands an immense idol, the upper portion of whose body is human, and
the lower fish-like. Between the belly and the tail is an aperture which
can be closed like the door of a closet. In it the transgressors against
the local deity were shut up until further disposal. The drawing in
question was made from an old tablet covered with curious drawings
and inscriptions in old Phœnician characters, describing this Venetian

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>

<i lang="fr">oubliette</i> of biblical days. The tablet itself was found in an excavation a
few miles from Jaffa. Considering the extraordinary tendency of Oriental
nations for puns and allegories, is it not barely possible that the “big
fish” by which Jonah was swallowed was simply the cell within the belly
of Dagon?</p>

<p>It is significant that this double appellation of “Messiah” and
“Dag” (fish), of the Talmudists, should so well apply to the Hindu
Vishnu, the “Preserving” Spirit, and the second personage of the
Brahmanic trinity. This deity, having already manifested itself, is still
regarded as the future Saviour of humanity, and is the selected
Redeemer, who will appear at its tenth incarnation or <i>avatar</i>, like the
Messiah of the Jews, to lead the blessed onward, and restore to them the
primitive <cite>Vedas</cite>. At his first avatar, Vishnu is alleged to have appeared
to humanity, in form like a fish. In the temple of Rama, there is a
representation of this god which answers perfectly to that of Dagon, as
given by Berosus. He has the body of a man issuing from the mouth
of a fish, and holds in his hands the lost <cite>Veda</cite>. Vishnu, moreover, is the
water-god, in one sense, the Logos of the Parabrahm, for as the three
persons of the manifested god-head constantly interchange their attributes,
we see him in the same temple represented as reclining on the
seven-headed serpent, Ananta (eternity), and moving, like the <em>Spirit</em> of
God, on the face of the primeval waters.</p>

<p>Vishnu is evidently the Adam Kadmon of the kabalists, for Adam is
the Logos or the first Anointed, as Adam Second is the King Messiah.</p>

<p>Lakmy, or Lakshmi, the passive or feminine counterpart of Vishnu,
the creator and the preserver, is also called Ada Maya. She is the
“Mother of the World,” Damatri, the Venus Aphrodite of the Greeks;
also Isis and Eve. While Venus is born from the sea-foam, Lakmy
springs out from the water at the churning of the sea; when born, she is
so beautiful that all the gods fall in love with her. The Jews, borrowing
their types wherever they could get them, made their first woman after the
pattern of Lakmy. It is curious that Viracocha, the Supreme Being in
Peru, means, literally translated, “foam of the sea.”</p>

<p>Eugene Burnouf, the great authority of the French school, announces
his opinion in the same spirit: “We must learn one day,” he observes,
“that all ancient traditions disfigured by emigration and legend, belong
to the history of India.” Such is the opinion of Colebrooke, Inman,
King, Jacolliot, and many other Orientalists.</p>

<p>We have said above, that, according to the secret computation peculiar
to the students of the hidden science, Messiah is the fifth emanation,
or potency. In the Jewish <cite>Kabala</cite>, where the ten Sephiroth emanate
from Adam Kadmon (placed below the crown), he comes fifth. So in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span>

the Gnostic system; so in the Buddhistic, in which the fifth Buddha—Maitree,
will appear at his last advent to save mankind before the final
destruction of the world. If Vishnu is represented in his forthcoming
and last appearance as the <em>tenth</em> avatar or incarnation, it is only because
every unit held as an androgyne manifests itself doubly. The Buddhists
who reject this dual-sexed incarnation reckon but five. Thus, while
Vishnu is to make his last appearance in his tenth, Buddha is said to do
the same in his fifth
 <span class="lock">incarnation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_536" id="FNanchor_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>The better to illustrate the idea, and show how completely the real
meaning of the avatars, known only to the students of the secret
doctrine was misunderstood by the ignorant masses, we elsewhere give
the diagrams of the Hindu and Chaldeo-Kabalistic avatars and
 <span class="lock">emanations.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_537" id="FNanchor_537">[537]</a></span>
This basic and true fundamental stone of the secret cycles,
shows on its very face, that far from taking their revealed <cite>Vedas</cite> and
<cite>Bible</cite> literally, the Brahman-pundits, and the Tanaïm—the scientists
and philosophers of the pre-Christian epochs—speculated on the creation
and development of the world quite in a Darwinian way, both anticipating
him and his school in the natural selection of species, gradual
development, and transformation.</p>

<p>We advise every one tempted to enter an indignant protest against
this affirmation to read more carefully the books of Manu, even in the
incomplete translation of Sir William Jones, and the more or less careless
one of Jacolliot. If we compare the Sanchoniathon Phœnician
Cosmogony, and the record of Berosus with the <i>Bhagavatta</i> and <cite>Manu</cite>,
we will find enunciated exactly the same principles as those now offered
as the latest developments of modern science. We have quoted from
the Chaldean and Phœnician records in our first volume; we will now
glance at the Hindu books.</p>

<p>“When this world had issued out of darkness, the subtile elementary
principles produced the vegetal seed which animated first the plants;
from the plants, life passed into fastastical bodies which were born <em>in the
ilus of the waters</em>; then, through a series of forms and various animals,
it reached
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_538" id="FNanchor_538">[538]</a></span></p>

<p>“He (man, before becoming such) will pass successively through
plants, worms, insects, fish, serpents, tortoises, cattle, and wild animals;
such is the inferior degree.”</p>

<p>“Such, from Brahma down to the vegetables, are declared the transmigrations
which take place in this
 <span class="lock">world.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_539" id="FNanchor_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">261</a></span>

In the Sanchoniathonian Cosmogony, men are also evolved out of
the ilus of the
 <span class="lock">chaos,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_540" id="FNanchor_540">[540]</a></span>
 and the same evolution and transformation of
species are shown.</p>

<p>And now we will leave the rostrum to Mr. Darwin: “I believe that
animals have descended from at most only four or five
 <span class="lock">progenitors.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_541" id="FNanchor_541">[541]</a></span></p>

<p>Again: “I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic
beings which have ever lived on this earth, have descended from some
one primordial
 <span class="lock">form.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_542" id="FNanchor_542">[542]</a></span>
... I view all beings, not as special creations, but
as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long <em>before the
first bed of the Silurian system was</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>deposited</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_543" id="FNanchor_543">[543]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, they lived in the Sanchoniathonian chaos, and in the <i>ilus</i>
of Manu. Vyasa and Kapila go still farther than Darwin and Manu.
“They see in Brahma but the name of the universal germ; <em>they deny
the existence of a First Cause</em>; and pretend that everything in nature
found itself developed only in consequence of material and fatal
forces,” says
 <span class="lock">Jacolliot.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_544" id="FNanchor_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>Correct as may be this latter quotation from Kapila, it demands a
few words of explanation. Jacolliot repeatedly compares Kapila and
Veda Vyasa with Pyrrho and Littré. We have nothing against such a
comparison with the Greek philosopher, but we must decidedly object to
any with the French Comtist; we find it an unmerited fling at the memory
of the great Aryan sage. Nowhere does this prolific writer state
the repudiation by either ancient or modern Brahmans of God—the
“unknown,” universal Spirit; nor does any other Orientalist accuse the
Hindus of the same, however perverted the general deductions of our
savants about Buddhistic atheism. On the contrary, Jacolliot states more
than once that the learned Pundits and educated Brahmans have never
shared the popular superstitions; and affirms their unshaken belief in
the unity of God and the soul’s immortality, although most assuredly
neither Kapila, nor the initiated Brahmans, nor the followers of the
Vedanta school would ever admit the existence of an anthropomorphic
creator, a “First Cause” in the Christian sense. Jacolliot, in his <cite>Indo-European
and African Traditions</cite>, is the first to make an onslaught on
Professor Müller, for remarking that the Hindu gods were “masks
without actors ... names without being, and not beings without
 <span class="lock">names.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_545" id="FNanchor_545">[545]</a></span>
 Quoting, in support of his argument, numerous verses from
the sacred Hindu books, he adds: “Is it possible to refuse to the
author of these stanzas a definite and clear conception of the divine

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>

force, of the Unique Being, master and Sovereign of the Universe?...
Were the altars then built to a
 <span class="lock">metaphor?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_546" id="FNanchor_546">[546]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter argument is perfectly just, so far as Max Müller’s negation
is concerned. But we doubt whether the French rationalist understands
Kapila’s and Vyasa’s philosophy better than the German philologist
does the “theological twaddle,” as the latter terms the <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>.
Professor Müller and Jacolliot may have ever so great claims to
erudition, and be ever so familiar with Sanscrit and other ancient
Oriental languages, but both lack the key to the thousand and one mysteries
of the old secret doctrine and its philosophy. Only, while the
German philologist does not even take the trouble to look into this magical
and “theological twaddle,” we find the French Indianist never losing
an opportunity to investigate. Moreover, he honestly admits his incompetency
to ever fathom this ocean of mystical learning. In its existence
he not only firmly believes, but throughout his works he incessantly calls
the attention of science to its unmistakable traces at every step in
India. Still, though the learned Pundits and Brahmans—his “revered
masters” of the pagodas of Villenoor and Chélambrum in the
 <span class="lock">Carnatic,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_547" id="FNanchor_547">[547]</a></span>
as it seems, positively refused to reveal to him the mysteries of
the magical part of the
 <span class="lock"><cite>Agrouchada-Parikshaï</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_548" id="FNanchor_548">[548]</a></span>
 and of Brahmâtma’s
 <span class="lock">triangle,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_549" id="FNanchor_549">[549]</a></span>
 he persists in the honest declaration that everything is possible
in Hindu metaphysics, even to the Kapila and Vyasa systems having
been hitherto misunderstood.</p>

<p>M. Jacolliot weakens his assertion immediately afterward with the following
contradiction:</p>

<p>“We were one day inquiring of a Brahman of the pagoda of Chélambrum,
who belonged to the <em>skeptical school of the naturalists of Vyasa</em>,
whether he believed in the existence of God. He answered us, smiling:
‘<cite>Aham eva param Brahma</cite>’—I am myself a god.</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean by that?’</p>

<p>“‘I mean that every being on earth, however humble, is an immortal
portion of the immortal
 <span class="lock">matter.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_550" id="FNanchor_550">[550]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer is one which would suggest itself to every ancient philosopher,
Kabalist and Gnostic, of the early days. It contains the very
spirit of the delphic and kabalistic commandment, for esoteric philosophy
solved, ages ago, the problem of what man was, is, and will be. If persons

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>

believing the <cite>Bible</cite> verse which teaches that the “Lord God formed
man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath
of life,” reject at the same time the idea that every atom of this dust, as
every particle of this “living soul,” contains “God” within itself, then we
pity the logic of that Christian. He forgets the verses which precede the
one in question. God blesses equally every beast of the field and every
living creature, in the water as in the air, and He endows them all with
<em>life</em>, which is a breath of His own Spirit, and the <em>soul</em> of the animal.
Humanity is the Adam Kadmon of the “Unknown,” His microcosm, and
His only representative on earth, and every man is a god on earth.</p>

<p>We would ask this French scholar, who seems so familiar with every
sloka of the books of Manu, and other Vedic writers, the meaning of this
sentence so well known to him:</p>

<p>“Plants and vegetation reveal a multitude of forms because of their
precedent actions; they are surrounded by darkness, but are nevertheless
endowed with an interior soul, and feel equally pleasure and pain”
(<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>).</p>

<p>If the Hindu philosophy teach the presence of a degree of <em>soul</em> in
the lowest forms of vegetable life, and even in every atom in space, how
is it possible that it should deny the same immortal principle to man?
And if it once admit the immortal spirit in man, how can it logically
deny the existence of the parent source—I will not say the first, but the
eternal Cause? Neither rationalists nor sensualists, who do not comprehend
Indian metaphysics, should estimate the ignorance of Hindu metaphysicians
by their own.</p>

<p>The grand cycle, as we have heretofore remarked, includes the progress
of mankind from its germ in the primordial man of spiritual form
to the deepest depth of degradation he can reach—each successive step
in the descent being accompanied by a greater strength and grossness of
the physical form than its precursor—and ends with the Flood. But
while the grand cycle, or age, is running its course, seven minor cycles are
passed, each marking the evolution of a new race out of the preceding one,
on a new world. And each of these races, or grand types of humanity,
breaks up into subdivisions of families, and they again into nations and
tribes, as we see the earth’s inhabitants subdivided to-day into Mongols,
Caucasians, Indians, etc.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to show by diagrams the close resemblance between
the esoteric philosophies of all the ancient peoples, however geographically
remote from each other, it will be useful to briefly explain the real
ideas which underlie all those symbols and allegorical representations and
have hitherto so puzzled the uninitiated commentators. Better than anything,
it may show that religion and science were closer knit than twins

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
in days of old; that they were one in two and two in one from the very
moment of their conception. With mutually convertible attributes, science
was spiritual and religion was scientific. Like the androgyne man of the
first chapter of <cite>Genesis</cite>—“male and female,” passive and active; created
in the image of the Elohim. Omniscience developed omnipotency, the
latter called for the exercise of the former, and thus the giant had
dominion given him over all the four kingdoms of the world. But, like
the second Adam, these androgynes were doomed to “fall and lose their
powers” as soon as the two halves of the duality separated. The fruit of
the Tree of Knowledge gives death without the fruit of the Tree of Life.
Man must know <em>himself</em> before he can hope to know the ultimate genesis
even of beings and powers less developed in their inner nature than himself.
So with religion and science; united two in one they were infallible,
for the spiritual intuition was there to supply the limitations of physical
senses. Separated, exact science rejects the help of the inner voice,
while religion becomes merely dogmatic theology—each is but a corpse
without a soul.</p>

<p>The esoteric doctrine, then, teaches, like Buddhism and Brahmanism,
and even the persecuted <cite>Kabala</cite>, that the one infinite and unknown Essence
exists from all eternity, and in regular and harmonious successions is
either passive or active. In the poetical phraseology of Manu these conditions
are called the “day” and the “night” of Brahma. The latter is
either “awake” or “asleep.” The Svâbhâvikas, or philosophers of the
oldest school of Buddhism (which still exists in Nepaul), speculate but
upon the active condition of this “Essence,” which they call Svabhâvât,
and deem it foolish to theorize upon the abstract and “unknowable”
power in its passive condition. Hence they are called atheists by both
Christian theology and modern scientists; for neither of the two are able
to understand the profound logic of their philosophy. The former will
allow of no other God than the personified <em>secondary</em> powers which have
blindly worked out the visible universe, and which became with them the
anthropomorphic God of the Christians—the Jehovah, roaring amid
thunder and lightning. In its turn, rationalistic science greets the Buddhists
and the Svâbhâvikas as the “positivists” of the archaic ages. If
we take a one-sided view of the philosophy of the latter, our materialists
may be right in their own way. The Buddhists maintain that there is <em>no</em>
Creator but an infinitude of <em>creative powers</em>, which collectively form the
one eternal substance, the <em>essence</em> of which is inscrutable—hence not a
subject for speculation for any true philosopher. Socrates invariably
refused to argue upon the mystery of universal being, yet no one would
ever have thought of charging him with atheism, except those who were
bent upon his destruction. Upon inaugurating an active period, says the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>

<cite>Secret Doctrine</cite>, an expansion of this Divine essence, <em>from within outwardly</em>,
occurs in obedience to eternal and immutable law, and the phenomenal
or visible universe is the ultimate result of the long chain of
cosmical forces thus progressively set in motion. In like manner, when
the passive condition is resumed, a contraction of the Divine essence
takes place, and the previous work of creation is gradually and progressively
undone. The visible universe becomes disintegrated, its material
dispersed; and “darkness,” solitary and alone, broods once more over
the face of the “deep.” To use a metaphor which will convey the idea
still more clearly, an outbreathing of the “unknown essence” produces
the world; and an inhalation causes it to disappear. <em>This process has
been going on from all eternity, and our present universe is but one of an
infinite series which had no beginning and will have no end.</em></p>

<p>Thus we are enabled to build our theories solely on the visible manifestations
of the Deity, on its objective natural phenomena. To apply to
these creative principles the term God is puerile and absurd. One might
as well call by the name of Benvenuto Cellini the fire which fuses the
metal, or the air that cools it when it is run in the mould. If the inner
and ever-concealed spiritual, and to our minds abstract, Essence within
these forces can ever be connected with the creation of the physical universe,
it is but in the sense given to it by Plato. <span class="smcap">It</span> may be termed, at
best, the framer of the abstract universe which developed gradually in the
Divine Thought within which it had lain dormant.</p>

<p>In Chapter <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> we will attempt to show the esoteric meaning of
<cite>Genesis</cite>, and its complete agreement with the ideas of other nations. The
six days of creation will be found to have a meaning little suspected by
the multitude of commentators, who have exercised their abilities to the
full extent in attempting to reconcile them by turns with Christian theology
and un-Christian geology. Disfigured as the <cite>Old Testament</cite> is, yet in its
symbolism are preserved enough of the original in its principal features
to show the family likeness to the cosmogonies of older nations than
the Jews.</p>

<p>We here give the diagrams of the Hindu and the Chaldeo-Jewish cosmogonies.
The antiquity of the diagram of the former may be inferred
from the fact that many of the Brahmanical pagodas are designed and
built on this figure, called the
 <span class="lock">“Sri-Iantara.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_551" id="FNanchor_551">[551]</a></span>
 And yet we find the highest
honors paid to it by the Jewish and mediæval kabalists, who call it
“Solomon’s seal.” It will be quite an easy matter to trace it to its origin,
once we are reminded of the history of the king-kabalist and his transactions
with King Hiram and Ophir—the country of peacocks, gold, and
ivory—for which land we have to search in old India.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Space Around the Upper Triangle.</i></p>

<p>When the “Night of Brahma” was
ended, and the time came for the Self-Existent
to manifest <em>Itself</em> by revelation,
it made its glory visible by sending forth
from its Essence an active Power, which,
female at first, subsequently becomes

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>

androgyne. It is Aditi, the “Infinite,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_553" id="FNanchor_553">[553]</a>
the Boundless, or rather the “Un-bounded.”
Aditi is the “mother” of all
the gods, and Aditi is the Father and the
Son.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_554" id="FNanchor_554">[554]</a> “Who will give us back to the great
Aditi, that I may see father and mother?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_555" id="FNanchor_555">[555]</a>
It is in conjunction with the latter female,
Force, that the Divine but latent Thought
produces the great “Deep”—water.
“Water is born from a transformation of
light ... and from a <em>modification</em> of the
water is born the earth,” says Manu (book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>).

“Ye are born of Aditi from the water,
you who are born of the earth, hear ye all
my call.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_556" id="FNanchor_556">[556]</a>

In this water (or primeval chaos) the
“Infinite” androgyne, which, with the
Eternal Cause, forms the first abstract
Triad, rendered by <span class="smcap">Aum</span>, deposited the
germ of universal life. It is the Mundane
Egg, in which took place the gestation of
Pūrūsha, or the manifested Brahma. The
germ which fecundated the <em>Mother</em> Principle
(the water) is called Nara, the Divine
Spirit or Holy <span class="lock">Ghost,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_558" id="FNanchor_558">[558]</a></span> and the waters
themselves, are an emanation of the former,
Nari, while the Spirit which brooded over
it is called Narayana.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_559" id="FNanchor_559">[559]</a>
“In that egg, the great Power sat inactive
a whole <em>year of the Creator</em>, at the
close of which, by his thought alone, he
caused the egg to divide <span class="lock">itself.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_560" id="FNanchor_560">[560]</a></span> The
upper half became heaven, the lower, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>

earth (both yet in their ideal, not their
manifested form).</p>

<p>Thus, this second triad, only another
name for the first one (never pronounced
aloud), and which is the real pre-Vedic
and primordial <em>secret</em> Trimurti, consisted
of</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><td class="tdl">Nara,</td><td>
    </td><td class="tdl pad3">Father-Heaven,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Nari,</td><td>
    </td><td class="tdl pad3">Mother-Earth,</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdl">Viradj,</td><td>
    </td><td class="tdl pad3">the Son—or Universe.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The Trimurti, comprising Brahma, the
Creator, Vishnu, the Preserver, and Siva,
the Destroyer and Regenerator, belongs to
a later period. It is an anthropomorphic
afterthought, invented for the more popular
comprehension of the uninitiated
masses. The <i>Dikshita</i>, the initiate, knew
better. Thus, also, the profound allegory
under the colors of a ridiculous fable, given
in the <cite>Aytareya</cite> <span class="lock"><cite>Brahmana</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_562" id="FNanchor_562">[562]</a></span> which resulted
in the representations in some temples
of Brahm-Nara, assuming the form
of a bull, and his daughter, Aditi-Nari, that
of a heifer, contains the same metaphysical
idea as the “fall of man,” or that of the
Spirit into generation—matter. The All-pervading
Divine Spirit embodied under
the symbols of Heaven, the Sun, and
Heat (fire)—the correlation of cosmic
forces—fecundates Matter or Nature, the
daughter of Spirit. And Para-Brahma
himself has to submit to and bear the
penance of the curses of the other gods
(Elohim) for such an incest. (See corresponding
column.) According to the immutable,
and, therefore, fatal law, both
Nara and Nari are mutually Father and
Mother, as well as Father and Daughter.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_563" id="FNanchor_563">[563]</a>
Matter, through infinite transformation, is
the gradual product of Spirit. The unification
of one Eternal Supreme Cause required
such a correlation; and if nature be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>

the product or effect of that Cause, in its
turn it has to be fecundated by the same
divine Ray which produced nature itself.
The most absurd cosmogonical allegories,
if analyzed without prejudice, will be found
built on strict and logical necessarianism.</p>

<p>“Being was born from not-being,” says
a verse in the <span class="lock"><cite>Rig-Veda</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_564" id="FNanchor_564">[564]</a></span> The first being
had to become androgyne and finite, by the
very fact of its creation as a being. And
thus even the sacred Trimurti, containing
Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva will have an
end when the “night” of Para-Brahma
succeeds the present “day,” or period of
universal activity.</p>

<p>The second, or rather the first, triad—-as
the highest one is a pure abstraction—is
the intellectual world. The Vâch which
surrounds it is a more definite transformation
of Aditi. Besides its occult significance
in the secret Mantrâm, Vâch is
personified as the active power of Brahma
proceeding from him. In the <cite>Vedas</cite> she
is made to speak of herself as the supreme
and universal soul. “I bore the Father
on the head of the universal mind, and <em>my
origin is in the midst of the ocean</em>; and
therefore do I pervade all beings....
Originating all beings, I pass like the breeze
(Holy Ghost). I am above this heaven,
beyond this earth; and <em>what is the Great
One that am</em> <span class="lock"><em>I</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_565" id="FNanchor_565">[565]</a></span> Literally, Vâch is
speech, the power of awakening, through
the metrical arrangement contained in the
number and syllables of the <span class="lock">Mantras,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_566" id="FNanchor_566">[566]</a></span>
 corresponding powers in the invisible world.
In the sacrificial Mysteries Vâch stirs up
the Brahma (<i>Brahma jinvati</i>), or the
power lying latent at the bottom of every
magical operation. It existed from eternity
as the Yajna (its latent form), lying
dormant in Brahma from “no-beginning,”
and proceeded forth from him as Vâch (the
active power). It is the key to the “Traividyâ,”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span>

the thrice sacred science which
teaches the Yajus (the sacrificial Mysteries).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_567" id="FNanchor_567">[567]</a></p>

<p>Having done with the unrevealed triad,
and the first triad of the Sephiroth, called
the “intellectual world,” little remains to
be said. In the great geometrical figure
which has the double triangle in it, the
central circle represents the world within
the universe. The double triangle belongs
to one of the most important, if it is not
in itself the most important, of the mystic
figures in India. It is the emblem of the
Trimurti three in one. The triangle with
its apex upward indicates the male principle,
downward the female; the two typifying,
at the same time, spirit and matter.
This world within the infinite universe is
the microcosm within the macrocosm, as
in the Jewish <cite>Kabala</cite>. It is the symbol of
the womb of the universe, the terrestrial
egg, whose archetype is the golden mundane
egg. It is from within this spiritual
bosom of mother nature that proceed all
the great saviours of the universe—the
avatars of the invisible Deity.</p>

<p>“Of him who is and yet is not, from the
not-being, Eternal Cause, is born the being
Pouroucha,” says Manu, the legislator.
Pouroucha is the “divine male,” the <em>second</em>
god, and the avatar, or the Logos of Para-Brahma
and his divine son, who in his
turn produced Viradj, the son, or the ideal
type of the universe. “Viradj begins the
work of creation by producing the ten
Pradjapati, ‘the lords of all beings.’”</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of Manu, the
universe is subjected to a periodical and
never-ending succession of creations and
dissolutions, which periods of creation are
named Manvântara.</p>

<p>“It is the germ (which the Divine Spirit
produced from its own substance) which
never perishes in the being, for it becomes
the soul of Being, and at the
period of <i>pralaya</i> (dissolution) it returns
to absorb itself again <em>into the Divine</em>
Spirit, <em>which itself</em> rests from all eternity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>

within Swayambhuva, the ‘Self-Existent’”
(<cite>Institutes of Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>).</p>

<p>As we have shown, neither the Svâbhâvikas,
Buddhist philosophers—nor the
Brahmans believe in a creation of them
universe <i lang="la">ex nihilo</i>, but both believe in
the <i>Prakriti</i>, the indestructibility of matter.</p>

<p>The evolution of species, and the successive
appearance of various new types is
very distinctly shown in <cite>Manu</cite>.</p>

<p>“From earth, heat, and water, are born
all creatures, whether animate or inanimate,
produced by the germ which the
Divine Spirit drew from its own substance.
Thus has Brahma established the series of
transformations from the plant up to man,
and from man up to the primordial essence....
Among them each succeeding
being (or element) acquires the quality of
the preceding; and in as many degrees as
each of them is advanced, with so many
properties is it said to be endowed”
(<cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, sloka 20).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_570" id="FNanchor_570">[570]</a></p>

<p>This, we believe, is the veritable theory
of the modern evolutionists.</p>

<div class="right-page">

<p class="center"><i>The Space Around the Upper Triangle.</i></p>

<p>When the active period had arrived,
En-Soph sent forth from within his own
eternal essence, Sephira, the active
Power, called the Primordial Point, and
the Crown, <i>Keter</i>. It is only through her
that the “Un-bounded Wisdom” could
give a concrete form to his abstract
Thought. Two sides of the upper triangle,
the right side and the base, are composed
of unbroken lines; the third, the
left side, is dotted. It is through the latter
that emerges Sephira. Spreading in
every direction, she finally encompasses the
whole triangle. In this emanation of the
female active principle from the left side
of the mystic triangle, is foreshadowed the
creation of Eve from Adam’s left rib.
Adam is the Microcosm of the Macrocosm,
and is created in the image of the Elohim.
In the Tree of Life עצחיום <a id="hebrew9"></a> the triple
triad is disposed in such a manner that the
three male Sephiroth are on the right, the
three female on the left, and the four
uniting principles in the centre. From the
Invisible Dew falling from the Higher
“Head” Sephira creates primeval water,
or chaos taking shape. It is the first step
toward the solidification of Spirit, which
through various modifications will produce
earth.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_557" id="FNanchor_557">[557]</a>
 “<cite>It requires earth and water to
make a living soul</cite>,” says Moses.</p>

<p>When Sephira emerges like an active
power from within the latent Deity, she is
female; when she assumes the office of a
creator, she becomes a male; hence, she
is androgyne. She is the “Father and
Mother Aditi,” of the Hindu Cosmogony.
After rooding over the “Deep,” the
“Spirit of God” produces its own image
in the water, the Universal Womb, symbolized
in <cite>Manu</cite> by the Golden Egg. In
the kabalistic Cosmogony, Heaven and
 Earth are personified by Adam Kadmon
and the second Adam. The first Ineffable
 Triad, contained in the abstract idea of the
“Three Heads,” was a “mystery name.”
It was composed of En-Soph, Sephira,
and Adam Kadmon, the Protogonos, the
latter being identical with the former,
when <span class="lock">bisexual.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_561" id="FNanchor_561">[561]</a></span>
In every triad there is
a male, a female, and an androgyne.
Adam-Sephira is the Crown (Keter). It
sets itself to the work of creation, by first
 producing Chochmah, Male Wisdom, a
 masculine active potency, represented by
 חה, jah, or the Wheels of Creation, אפּוַים, <a id="hebrew11"></a> from
 which proceeds Binah, Intelligence,
female and passive potency, which is <i>Jehovah</i>,
 יהוה, whom we find in the <cite>Bible</cite> figuring
 as the Supreme. But this Jehovah
is not the kabalistic Jodcheva. The
<em>binary</em> is the fundamental corner-stone of
<i>Gnosis</i>. As the binary is the Unity multiplying
itself and self-creating, the kabalists
show the “Unknown” passive En-Soph,
as emanating from himself, Sephira,
which, becoming visible light, is said to
produce Adam Kadmon. But, in the hidden
sense, Sephira and Adam are one and
the same light, only latent and active, invisible
 and visible. The second Adam, as
the human tetragram, produces in his
 turn Eve, out of his side. It is this second
triad, with which the kabalists have
 hitherto dealt, hardly hinting at the Supreme
and Ineffable One, and never committing
anything to writing. All knowledge
 concerning the latter was imparted
orally. It is the <em>second</em> Adam, then, who
is the unity represented by <i>Jod</i>, emblem
 of the kabalistic male principle, and, at
the same time, he is Chochmah, <i>Wisdom</i>,
while <i>Binah</i> or Jehovah is Eve; the first
Chochmah issuing from Keter, or the androgyne,
Adam Kadmon, and the second,
Binah, from Chochmah. If we combine
with <i>Jod</i> the three letters which form the
name of Eve, we will have the divine
tetragram pronounced <span class="smcap">Ievo-hevah</span>, Adam
 and Eve, יחוה, Jehovah, male and female,
 or the idealization of humanity embodied
in the first man. Thus is it that we can
prove that, while the Jewish kabalists, in
 common with their initiated masters, the
 Chaldeans and the Hindus, adored the
Supreme and Unknown God, in the sacred
silence of their sanctuaries, the ignorant
masses of every nation were left to adore
something which was certainly less than
the Eternal Substance of the Buddhists,
the so-called Atheists. As Brahma, the
deity manifested in the mythical <cite>Manu</cite>, or
the first man (born of Swayambhuva, or
the Self-existent), is finite, so Jehovah,
 embodied in Adam and Eve, is but a
<em>human</em> god. He is the symbol of humanity,
a mixture of good with a portion of
unavoidable evil; of spirit fallen into matter.
In worshipping Jehovah, we simply
worship nature, as embodied in man, half-spiritual
and half-material, at best: we
are Pantheists, when not fetich worshippers,
like the idolatrous Jews, who
sacrificed on high places, in groves, to the
personified male and female principle,
ignorant of <span class="smcap">Iao</span>, the Supreme “Secret
Name” of the Mysteries.</p>

<p>Shekinah is the Hindu Vâch, and praised
in the same terms as the latter. Though
shown in the kabalistic Tree of Life as proceeding
from the ninth Sephiroth, yet
Shekinah is the “veil” of En-Soph, and
 the “garment” of Jehovah. The “veil,”
for it succeeded for long ages in concealing
the real supreme God, the universal Spirit,
and masking Jehovah, the exoteric deity,
made the Christians accept him as the
“father” of the initiated Jesus. Yet the
kabalists, as well as the Hindu <i>Dikshita</i>,
know the power of the Shekinah or

 wisdom,” חכמח־נסהדח.</p>

<p>The triangle played a prominent part in
the religious symbolism of every great
nation; for everywhere it represented the
three great principles—spirit, force, and
matter; or the active (male), passive (female),
and the dual or correlative principle
which partakes of both and binds the two
together. It was the <i>Arba</i> or mystic
<span class="lock">“four,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_568" id="FNanchor_568">[568]</a></span>
summarized in the unity of one supreme
Deity. It is found in the Egyptian pyramids,
whose equal sides tower up until
lost in one crowning point. In the kabalistic
diagram the central circle of the
Brahmanical figure is replaced by the cross;
the celestial perpendicular and the terrestrial
horizontal base <span class="lock">line.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_569" id="FNanchor_569">[569]</a></span>
 But the idea
is the same: Adam Kadmon is the type
of humanity as a collective totality within
the unity of the creative God and the universal
spirit.</p>

<p>“Of him who is formless, the non-existent
(also the eternal, but <em>not</em> First Cause),
is born the heavenly man.” But after he
created the form of the heavenly man
  אדמעלאה, he “used it as a vehicle wherein
to descend,” says the <cite>Kabala</cite>. Thus Adam
Kadmon is the avatar of the concealed
power. After that the heavenly Adam
creates or engenders by the combined
power of the Sephiroth, the earthly Adam.
The work of creation is also begun by
Sephira in the creation of the ten Sephiroth
(who are the Pradjapatis of the
<cite>Kabala</cite>, for they are likewise the Lords of
all beings).</p>

<p>The <cite>Sohar</cite> asserts the same. According
to the kabalistic doctrine there were old
worlds (see Idra Suta: <cite>Sohar</cite>, <abbr title="three, page">iii., p</abbr>.
 292 b). Everything will return some day to
that from which it first proceeded. “All
things of which this world consists, spirit as
well as body, will return to their principal,
and the roots from which they proceeded”
(<cite>Sohar</cite>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, 218 b). The kabalists also
maintain the indestructibility of matter,
albeit their doctrine is shrouded still more
carefully than that of the Hindus. The
creation is eternal, and the universe is the
“garment,” or “the veil of God”—Shekinah;
and the latter is immortal and
eternal as Him within whom it has ever
existed. Every world is made after the
pattern of its predecessor, and each more
gross and material than the preceding one.
In the <cite>Kabala</cite> all were called sparks.
Finally, our present grossly materialistic
world was formed.</p>

<p>In the Chaldean account of the period
which preceded the Genesis of our world,
Berosus speaks of a time when there
existed nothing but darkness, and an abyss
of waters, filled with hideous monsters,
“produced of a two-fold principle....
These were creatures in which were combined
the limbs of every species of animals.
In addition to these fishes, reptiles,
serpents, with other monstrous animals,
which assumed each other’s shape
and countenance.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_571" id="FNanchor_571">[571]</a></p>

<p>In the first book of Manu, we read: “Know that the sum of 1,000
divine ages, composes the totality of one day of Brahma; and that one
night is equal to that day.” One thousand divine ages is equal to
4,320,000,000 of human years, in the Brahmanical calculations.</p>

<p>“At the expiration of each night, Brahma, who has been asleep,
awakes, and through the sole energy of the motion causes to emanate
from himself the spirit, which in its essence <em>is</em>, and yet is not.”</p>

<p>“Prompted by the desire to create, the Spirit (first of the emanations)
operates the creation and gives birth to ether, which the sages consider
as having the faculty of transmitting sound.</p>

<p>“Ether begets air whose property is tangible, and which is necessary
to life.</p>

<p>“Through a transformation of the air, light is produced.</p>

<p>“From air and light, which begets heat, water is formed, and the
water is the womb of all the living germs.”</p>

<p>Throughout the whole immense period of progressive creation, covering
4,320,000,000 years, ether, air, water and fire (heat), are constantly
forming matter under the never-ceasing impulse of the Spirit, or the <em>unrevealed</em>
God who fills up the whole creation, for he is in all, and all is in
him. This computation, which was secret and which is hardly hinted
at even now, led Higgins into the error of dividing every ten ages into
6,000 years. Had he added a few more ciphers to his sums he might have
come nearer to a correct explanation of the neroses, or
 secret <span class="lock">cycles.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_572" id="FNanchor_572">[572]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <cite>Sepher Jezireh</cite>, the kabalistic Book of Creation, the author
has evidently repeated the words of Manu. In it, the Divine Substance
is represented as having alone existed from the eternity, boundless and
absolute; and emitted from itself the Spirit. “One is the Spirit of the
living God, blessed be His Name, who liveth for ever! Voice, Spirit,
and Word, this is the Holy
 <span class="lock">Spirit;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_573" id="FNanchor_573">[573]</a></span>
 and this is the kabalistic abstract
Trinity, so unceremoniously anthropomorphized by the Fathers. From
this triple <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> emanated the whole Cosmos. First from <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> emanated
number <span class="allsmcap">TWO</span>, or Air, the creative element; and then number <span class="allsmcap">THREE</span>,
<i>Water</i>, proceeded from the air; <i>Ether</i> or <i>Fire</i> complete the mystic four,
the <span class="lock">Arba-il.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_574" id="FNanchor_574">[574]</a></span>
 “When the Concealed of the Concealed wanted to reveal
Himself, he first made a point (primordial point, or the first Sephira, air
or Holy Ghost), shaped it into a sacred form (the ten Sephiroth, or the
Heavenly man), and covered it with a rich and splendid garment, <em>that is
the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>world</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_575" id="FNanchor_575">[575]</a></span>
 “He maketh the wind His messengers, flaming Fire his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
servants,” says the <cite>Jezireh</cite>, showing the cosmical character of the later
euhemerized
 <span class="lock">angels,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_576" id="FNanchor_576">[576]</a></span>
 and that the Spirit permeates every minutest atom
of the
 <span class="lock">Cosmos.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_577" id="FNanchor_577">[577]</a></span></p>

<p>When the cycle of creation is run down, the energy of the manifested
word is weakening. He alone, the Unconceivable, is unchangeable (ever
latent), but the Creative Force, though also eternal, as it has been in the
former from “no beginning,” yet must be subject to periodical cycles of
activity and rest; as it had a <em>beginning</em> in one of its aspects, when it first
emanated, therefore must also have an end. Thus, the evening succeeds
the day, and the night of the deity approaches. Brahma is gradually
falling asleep. In one of the books of <cite>Sohar</cite>, we read the following:</p>

<p>“As Moses was keeping a vigil on Mount Sinai, in company with the
Deity, who was concealed from his sight by a cloud, he felt a great fear
overcome him and suddenly asked: ‘Lord, where art Thou ... sleepest
thou, O Lord?’ And the <em>Spirit</em> answered him: ‘I never sleep;
were I to fall asleep for a moment <em>before my time</em>, all the Creation would
crumble into dissolution in one instant.’” And Vamadeva-Modēly describes
the “Night of Brahma,” or the second period of the Divine Unknown
existence, thus:</p>

<p>“Strange noises are heard, proceeding from every point.... These
are the precursors of the Night of Brahma; <em>dusk rises at the horizon</em> and
the Sun passes away behind the thirtieth degree of Macara (sign of the
zodiac), and will reach no more the sign of the <i>Minas</i> (zodiacal <i>pisces</i>,
or fish). The gurus of the pagodas appointed to watch the rās-chakr
(Zodiac), may now break their circle and instruments, for they are henceforth
useless.</p>

<p>“Gradually light pales, heat diminishes, uninhabitable spots multiply
on the earth, the air becomes more and more rarefied; the springs of
waters dry up, the great rivers see their waves exhausted, the ocean
shows its sandy bottom, and plants die. Men and animals decrease in
size daily. Life and motion lose their force, planets can hardly gravitate
in space; they are extinguished one by one, like a lamp which the hand
of the chokra (servant) neglects to replenish. Sourya (the Sun) flickers
and goes out, matter falls into dissolution (pralaya), and Brahma
merges back into Dyäus, the Unrevealed God, and his task being accomplished,
he falls asleep. Another day is passed, night sets in and continues
until the future dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>

“And now again re-enter into the golden egg of His Thought, the
germs of all that exist, as the divine Manu tells us. During His peaceful
rest, the animated beings, endowed with the principles of action, cease
their functions, and all feeling (manas) becomes dormant. When they
are all absorbed in the <span class="smcap">Supreme Soul</span>, this Soul of all the beings sleeps
in complete repose, till the day when it resumes its form, and awakes
again from its primitive <span class="lock">darkness.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_578" id="FNanchor_578">[578]</a></span></p>

<p>If we now examine the ten mythical avatars of Vishnu, we find them
recorded in the following progression:</p>

<p>1. Matsya-Avatar: as a fish. It will also be his tenth and last avatar,
at the end of the Kali-yug.</p>

<p>2. Kurm-Avatar: as a tortoise.</p>

<p>3. Varaha: as a boar.</p>

<p>4. Nara-Sing: as a <i>man-lion</i>; last animal stage.</p>

<p>5. Vamuna: as a dwarf; first step toward the human form.</p>

<p>6. Parasu-Rama: as a hero, but yet an imperfect man.</p>

<p>7. Rama-Chandra: as the hero of Ramayâna. Physically a perfect
man; his next of kin, friend and ally Hanoumā, the monkey-god. <em>The
monkey endowed with</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>speech.</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_579" id="FNanchor_579">[579]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Christna-Avatar: the Son of the Virgin Devanaguy (or Devaki)
one formed by God, or rather by the manifested Deity Vishnu, who is
identical with Adam
 <span class="lock">Kadmon.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_580" id="FNanchor_580">[580]</a></span>
 Christna is also called Kaneya, the
Son of the Virgin.</p>

<p>9. Gautama-Buddha, Siddhârtha, or Sakya-muni. (The Buddhists
reject this doctrine of their Buddha being an incarnation of Vishnu.)</p>

<p>10. This avatar has not yet occurred. It is expected in the future,
like the Christian Advent, the idea of which was undoubtedly copied
from the Hindu. When Vishnu appears for the last time he will come as
a “Saviour.” According to the opinion of some Brahmans he will appear
himself under the form of the horse Kalki. Others maintain that he
will be mounting it. This horse is the envelope of the spirit of evil,
and Vishnu will mount it, invisible to all, till he has conquered it for
the last time. The “Kalki-Avataram,” or the last incarnation, divides

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>

Brahmanism into two sects. That of the Vaïhnâva refuses to recognize
the incarnations of their god Vishnu in animal forms literally. They
claim that these must be understood as allegorical.</p>

<p>In this diagram of avatars we see traced the gradual evolution and
transformation of all species out of the ante-Silurian mud of Darwin
and the <i>ilus</i> of Sanchoniathon and Berosus. Beginning with the Azoic
time, corresponding to the <i>ilus</i> in which Brahma implants the creative
germ, we pass through the Palæozoic and Mesozoic times, covered by the
first and second incarnations as the fish and tortoise; and the Cenozoic,
which is embraced by the incarnations in the animal and semi-human
forms of the boar and man-lion; and we come to the fifth and crowning
geological period, designated as the “era of mind, or age of man,”
whose symbol in the Hindu mythology is the dwarf—the first attempt of
nature at the creation of man. In this diagram we should follow the
main-idea, not judge the degree of knowledge of the ancient philosophers
by the literal acceptance of the popular form in which it is presented to
us in the grand epical poem of <cite>Maha-Bharata</cite> and its chapter
 the <cite>Bagaved-gitta</cite>.</p>

<p>Even the four ages of the Hindu chronology contain a far more philosophical
idea than appears on the surface. It defines them according to
both the psychological or mental and the physical states of man during
their period. Crita-yug, the golden age, the “age of joy,” or spiritual
innocence of man; Treta-yug, the age of silver, or that of fire—the period
of supremacy of man and of giants and of the sons of God; Dwapara-yug,
the age of bronze—a mixture already of purity and impurity (spirit and
matter), the age of doubt; and at last our own, the Kali-yug, or age of
iron, of darkness, misery, and sorrow. In this age, Vishnu had to incarnate
himself in Christna, in order to save humanity from the goddess
Kali, consort of Siva, the all-annihilating—the goddess of death, destruction,
and human misery. Kali is the best emblem to represent the “fall
of man;” the falling of spirit into the degradation of matter, with all its
terrific results. We have to rid ourselves of Kali before we can ever
reach “Moksha,” or Nirvana, the abode of blessed Peace and Spirit.</p>

<p>With the Buddhists the last incarnation is the fifth. When Maitree-Buddha
comes, then our present world will be destroyed; and a new
and a better one will replace it. The four arms of every Hindu Deity
are the emblems of the four preceding manifestations of our earth from
its invisible state, while its head typifies the fifth and last <i>Kalki</i>-Avatar,
when this would be destroyed, and the power of Budh—Wisdom (with
the Hindus, of Brahma), will be again called into requisition to manifest
itself—as a <i>Logos</i>—to create the future world.</p>

<p>In this diagram, the male gods typify Spirit in its deific attributes,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>

while their female counterparts—the <i>Sakti</i>, represent the active energies
of these attributes. The <i>Durga</i> (active virtue), is a subtile, invisible
force, which answers to Shekinah—the garment of En-Soph. She is the
Sakti through which the passive “Eternal” calls forth the visible universe
from its first ideal conception. Every one of the three personages of
the exoteric Trimurti are shown as using their <i>Sakti</i> as a <i>Vehan</i> (vehicle).
Each of them is for the time being the form which sits upon the
mysterious wagon of Ezekiel.</p>

<p>Nor do we see less clearly carried out in this succession of avatars,
the truly philosophical idea of a simultaneous spiritual and physical
evolution of creatures and man. From a fish the progress of this dual
transformation carries on the physical form through the shape of a tortoise,
a boar, and a man-lion; and then, appearing in the dwarf of
humanity, it shows Parasu Rama physically, a perfect, spiritually, an
undeveloped entity, until it carries mankind personified by one god-like
man, to the apex of physical and spiritual perfection—a god on earth.
In Christna and the other Saviours of the world we see the philosophical
idea of the progressive dual development understood and as clearly
expressed in the <cite>Sohar</cite>. The “Heavenly man,” who is the Protogonos,
Tikkun, the first-born of God, or the universal Form and Idea, engenders
Adam. Hence the latter is god-born in humanity, and endowed
with the attributes of all the ten Sephiroth. These are: Wisdom,
Intelligence, Justice, Love, Beauty, Splendor, Firmness, etc. They make
him the Foundation or basis, “<em>the mighty living one</em>,” אלחי, and the
crown of creation, thus placing him as the Alpha and Omega to reign
over the “kingdom”—Malchuth. “Man is both the import and the
highest degree of creation,” says the <cite>Sohar</cite>. “As soon as man was
created, everything was complete, including the upper and nether
worlds, for everything is comprised in man. He unites in himself all
forms” (<abbr title="three, page">iii., p.</abbr> 48 a).</p>

<p>But this does not relate to our degenerated mankind; it is only occasionally
that men are born who are the types of what man should be,
and yet is not. The first races of men were spiritual, and their protoplastic
bodies were not composed of the gross and material substances
of which we see them composed now-a-day. The first men were created
with all the faculties of the Deity, and powers far transcending those of
the angelic host; for they were the direct emanations of Adam Kadmon,
the primitive man, the Macrocosm; while the present humanity is
several degrees removed even from the earthly Adam, who was the
Microcosm, or “the little world.” Seir Anpin, the mystical figure
of the Man, consists of 243 numbers, and we see in the circles which
follow each other that it is the angels which emanated from the “Primitive

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>

Man,” not the Sephiroth from angels. Hence, man was intended
from the first to be a being of both a progressive and retrogressive nature.
Beginning at the apex of the divine cycle, he gradually began receding
from the centre of Light, acquiring at every new and lower sphere of being
(worlds each inhabited by a different race of human beings) a more solid
physical form and losing a portion of his <em>divine</em> faculties.</p>

<p>In the “fall of Adam” we must see, not the personal transgression
of man, but simply the law of the dual evolution. Adam, or “Man,”
begins his career of existences by dwelling in the garden of Eden
“dressed in the celestial garment, which <em>is a garment of heavenly
light</em>” (<cite>Sohar</cite>, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, 229 b); but when expelled he is “clothed” by God,
or the eternal law of Evolution or necessarianism, with coats of skin.
But even on this earth of material degradation—in which the divine
spark (Soul, a corruscation of the Spirit) was to begin its physical progression
in a series of imprisonments from a stone up to a man’s body—if
he but exercise his <span class="allsmcap">WILL</span> and call his deity to his help, man can transcend
the powers of the angel. “Know ye not that we shall judge
angels?” asks Paul (<cite>1 Corinthians</cite>, <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 3). The real man is the Soul
(Spirit), teaches the <cite>Sohar</cite>. “The mystery of the earthly man is after
the mystery of the heavenly man ... the wise can read the mysteries
in the human face” (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, 76 a).</p>

<p>This is still another of the many sentences by which Paul must be
recognized as an initiate. For reasons fully explained, we give far more
credit for genuineness to certain Epistles of the apostles, now dismissed
as apocryphal, than to many suspicious portions of the <cite>Acts</cite>. And we
find corroboration of this view in the <cite>Epistle of Paul to Seneca</cite>. In
this message Paul styles Seneca “my respected master,” while Seneca
terms the apostle simply “brother.”</p>

<p>No more than the true religion of Judaic philosophy can be judged by
the absurdities of the exoteric <cite>Bible</cite>, have we any right to form an
opinion of Brahmanism and Buddhism by their nonsensical and sometimes
disgusting popular forms. If we only search for the true essence
of the philosophy of both <cite>Manu</cite> and the <cite>Kabala</cite>, we will find that
Vishnu is, as well as Adam Kadmon, the expression of the universe
itself; and that his incarnations are but concrete and various embodiments
of the manifestations of this “Stupendous Whole.” “I am the
Soul, O, Arjuna. I am the Soul which exists in the heart of all beings;
and I am the beginning and the middle, and also the end of existing
things,” says Vishnu to his disciple, in <cite>Bagaved-gitta</cite> (<abbr title="chapter ten">ch. x.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71).</p>

<p>“I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end.... I am the
first and the last,” says Jesus to John (<abbr title="Revelation one"><cite>Rev.</cite> i.</abbr> 6, 17).</p>

<p>Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva are a trinity in a unity, and, like the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Christian trinity, they are mutually convertible. In the esoteric doctrine
they are one and the same manifestation of him “whose name is too
sacred to be pronounced, and whose power is too majestic and infinite to
be imagined.” Thus by describing the avatars of one, all others are
included in the allegory, with a change of form but not of substance. It
is out of such manifestations that emanated the many worlds that were, and
that will emanate the one—which is to come.</p>

<p>Coleman, followed in it by other Orientalists, presents the seventh
avatar of Vishnu in the most caricatured
 <span class="lock">way.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_581" id="FNanchor_581">[581]</a></span>
 Apart from the fact
that the <cite>Ramayana</cite> is one of the grandest epic poems in the world—the
source and origin of Homer’s inspiration—this avatar conceals one of
the most scientific problems of our modern day. The learned Brahmans
of India never understood the allegory of the famous war between men,
giants, and monkeys, otherwise than in the light of the transformation of
species. It is our firm belief that were European academicians to seek
for information from some learned native Brahmans, instead of unanimously
and incontinently rejecting their authority, and were they, like
Jacolliot—against whom they have nearly all arrayed themselves—to
seek for light in the oldest documents scattered about the country in
pagodas, they might learn strange but not useless lessons. Let any one
inquire of an <em>educated</em> Brahman the reason for the respect shown to monkeys—the
origin of which feeling is indicated in the story of the valorous
feats of Hanoumā, the generalissimo and faithful ally of the hero of
 <span class="lock">Ramayana,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_582" id="FNanchor_582">[582]</a></span>
and he would soon be disabused of the erroneous idea that the
Hindus accord deific honors to a monkey-<em>god</em>. He would, perhaps, learn—were
the Brahman to judge him worthy of an explanation—that the
Hindu sees in the ape but what Manu desired he should: the transformation
of species most directly connected with that of the human family—a
bastard branch engrafted on their own stock before the final perfection
of the
 <span class="lock">latter.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_583" id="FNanchor_583">[583]</a></span>
 He might learn, further, that in the eyes of the educated

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>

“heathen” the spiritual or <em>inner</em> man is one thing, and his terrestrial, physical
casket another. That <em>physical</em> nature, the great combination of
physical correlations of forces ever creeping on toward perfection, has to
avail herself of the material at hand; she models and remodels as she
proceeds, and finishing her crowning work in man, presents him alone as
a fit tabernacle for the overshadowing of the Divine spirit. But the latter
circumstance does not give man the right of life and death over the animals
lower than himself in the scale of <em>nature</em>, or the right to torture
them. Quite the reverse. Besides being endowed with a soul—of which
every animal, and even plant, is more or less possessed—man has his immortal
<em>rational</em> soul, or <i>nous</i>, which ought to make him at least equal in
magnanimity to the elephant, who treads so carefully, lest he should crush
weaker creatures than himself. It is this feeling which prompts Brahman
and Buddhist alike to construct hospitals for sick animals, and even insects,
and to prepare refuges wherein they may finish their days. It is this same
feeling, again, which causes the Jaïn sectarian to sacrifice one-half of his
life-time to brushing away from his path the helpless, crawling insects,
rather than recklessly deprive the smallest of life; and it is again
from this sense of highest benevolence and charity toward the weaker,
however abject the creature may be, that they honor one of the natural
modifications of their own dual nature, and that later the popular belief
in metempsychosis arose. No trace of the latter is to be found in the
<cite>Vedas</cite>; and the true interpretation of the doctrine, discussed at length
in <cite>Manu</cite> and the Buddhistic sacred books, having been confined from the
first to the learned sacerdotal castes, the false and foolish popular ideas
concerning it need occasion no surprise.</p>

<p>Upon those who, in the remains of antiquity, see evidence that
modern times can lay small claim to originality, it is common to charge
a disposition to exaggerate and distort facts. But the candid reader will
scarcely aver that the above is an example in point. There were evolutionists
before the day when the mythical Noah is made, in the <cite>Bible</cite>, to
float in his ark; and the ancient scientists were better informed, and had
their theories more logically defined than the modern evolutionists.</p>

<p>Plato, Anaxagoras, Pythagoras, the Eleatic schools of Greece, as well
as the old Chaldean sacerdotal colleges, all taught the doctrine of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>

dual evolution; the doctrine of the transmigration of souls referring only
to the progress of man from world to world, after death here. Every
philosophy worthy of the name, taught that the <em>spirit</em> of man, if not the
<em>soul</em>, was preëxistent. “The Essenes,” says Josephus, “believed that
the souls were immortal, and that they descended from the ethereal
spaces to be chained to
 <span class="lock">bodies.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_584" id="FNanchor_584">[584]</a></span>
 In his turn, Philo Judæus says, the
“air is full of them (of souls); those which are nearest the earth, descending
to be tied to mortal bodies, <a id="Greekch4"></a>παλινδρομοῦσι αὖθις, return to other
bodies, being desirous to live in
 <span class="lock">them.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_585" id="FNanchor_585">[585]</a></span>
 In the <cite>Sohar</cite>, the soul is made
to plead her freedom before God: “Lord of the Universe! I am happy
in this world, and do not wish to go into another world, where I shall be
a handmaid, and be exposed to all kinds of
 <span class="lock">pollutions.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_586" id="FNanchor_586">[586]</a></span>
 The doctrine
of fatal necessity, the everlasting immutable Law, is asserted in the
answer of the Deity: “Against thy will thou becomest an embryo, and
against thy will thou art

 Light would be incomprehensible
without darkness, to make it manifest by contrast; good would be no
good without evil, to show the priceless nature of the boon; and so,
personal virtue could claim no merit, unless it had passed through the
furnace of temptation. Nothing is eternal and unchangeable, save the
Concealed Deity. Nothing that is finite—whether because it had a
beginning, or must have an end—can remain stationary. It must either
progress or recede; and a soul which thirsts after a reünion with its
spirit, which alone confers upon it immortality, must purify itself through
cyclic transmigrations, onward toward the only Land of Bliss and Eternal
Rest, called in the <cite>Sohar</cite>, “The Palace of Love,” היבל אהבת; in the
Hindu religion, “Moksha;” among the Gnostics, the “Pleroma of
eternal Light;” and by the Buddhists, Nirvana. The Christian calls it
the “Kingdom of Heaven,” and claims to have alone found the truth,
whereas he has but invented a new name for a doctrine which is coëval
with man.</p>

<p>The proof that the transmigration of the soul does not relate to man’s
condition on this earth <em>after</em> death, is found in the <cite>Sohar</cite>, notwithstanding
the many incorrect renderings of its translators. “All souls which
have alienated themselves in heaven from the Holy One—blessed be His
Name—have thrown themselves into an abyss at their very existence,
and have anticipated the time when they are to descend on
 <span class="lock">earth.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_588" id="FNanchor_588">[588]</a></span>...

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>

Come and see when the soul reaches the abode of Love.... The soul
could not bear this light, but for the luminous mantle which she puts on.
For, just as the soul, when sent to this earth, puts on an earthly garment
to preserve herself here, so she receives above a shining garment, in
order to be able to look without injury into the mirror, whose light proceeds
from the Lord of
 <span class="lock">Light.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_589" id="FNanchor_589">[589]</a></span>
 Moreover, the <cite>Sohar</cite> teaches that the
soul cannot reach the abode of bliss, unless she has received the “holy
kiss,” or the re-union of the soul <em>with the substance from which she
emanated</em>—spirit. All souls are dual, and, while the latter is a feminine
principle, the spirit is masculine. While imprisoned in body, man is a
trinity, unless his pollution is such as to have caused his divorce from
the spirit. “Woe to the soul which prefers to her divine husband
(spirit), the earthly wedlock with her terrestrial body,” records a text of
the <cite>Book of the</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Keys</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_590" id="FNanchor_590">[590]</a></span></p>

<p>These ideas on the transmigrations and the trinity of man, were held
by many of the early Christian Fathers. It is the jumble made by the
translators of the <cite>New Testament</cite> and ancient philosophical treatises
between soul and spirit, that has occasioned the many misunderstandings.
It is also one of the many reasons why Buddha, Plotinus, and so many
other initiates are now accused of having longed for the total extinction
of their souls—“absorption unto the Deity,” or “reunion with the universal
soul,” meaning, according to modern ideas, annihilation. The
animal soul must, of course, be disintegrated of its particles, before it is
able to link its purer essence forever with the immortal spirit. But the
translators of both the <cite>Acts</cite> and the <cite>Epistles</cite>,
 who laid the foundation
of the <cite>Kingdom of Heaven</cite>, and the modern commentators on the
Buddhist <cite>Sutra of the Foundation of the Kingdom of Righteousness</cite>, have
muddled the sense of the great apostle of Christianity, as of the great
reformer of India. The former have smothered the word φυχικος, so that
no reader imagines it to have any relation with <i>soul</i>; and with this confusion
of <em>soul</em> and <em>spirit</em> together, <cite>Bible</cite> readers get only a perverted
sense of anything on the subject; and the interpreters of the latter have
failed to understand the meaning and object of the Buddhist four degrees
of Dhyâna.</p>

<p>In the writings of Paul, the entity of man is divided into a trine—flesh,
psychical existence or <em>soul</em>, and the overshadowing and at the same time
interior entity or <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>. His phraseology is very definite, when he
teaches the <i>anastasis</i>, or the continuation of life of those who have died.
He maintains that there is a <em>psychical</em> body which is sown in the
corruptible, and a spiritual body that is raised in incorruptible substance.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span>

“The first man is of the earth earthy, the second man from
heaven.” Even James (<abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 15) identifies the soul by saying that its
“wisdom descendeth not from the above but is terrestrial, <em>psychical</em>,
<em>demoniacal</em>” (see Greek text). Plato, speaking of the Soul (<i>psuché</i>), observes
that “when she allies herself to the <i>nous</i> (divine substance, a god,
as psuché is a goddess), she does everything aright and felicitously; but
the case is otherwise when she attaches herself to <i>Annoia</i>.” What Plato
calls <i>nous</i>, Paul terms the <i>Spirit</i>; and Jesus makes the <i>heart</i> what Paul
says of the <i>flesh</i>. The natural condition of mankind was called in
Greek αποστασια; the new condition αναστασις. In Adam came the
former (death), in Christ the latter (resurrection), for it is he who first
publicly taught mankind the “Noble Path” to Eternal life, as Gautama
pointed the same Path to Nirvana. To accomplish both ends there was
but one way, according to the teachings of both. “Poverty, chastity,
contemplation or inner prayer; contempt for wealth and the illusive joys
of this world.”</p>

<p>“Enter on this Path and put an end to sorrow; verily the Path has
been preached by me, who have found out how to quench the darts of
grief. You yourselves must make the effort; <em>the Buddhas are only
preachers</em>. The thoughtful who enter the Path are freed from the bondage
of the Deceiver
 <span class="lock">(Marâ).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_591" id="FNanchor_591">[591]</a></span></p>

<p>“Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the
way that leadeth to destruction.... Follow me.... Every one that
heareth these sayings and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish
man” (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> and <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr>).
 “<cite>I can of mine own self do nothing</cite>”
(<cite>John</cite> <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 30). “The care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
choke the word” (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="thirteen">xiii.</abbr> 22), say the Christians; and it is only
by shaking off all delusions that the Buddhist enters on the “Path”
which will lead him “away from the restless tossing waves of the ocean
of life,” and take him “to the calm City of Peace, to the real joy and
rest of Nirvana.”</p>

<p>The Greek philosophers are alike made misty instead of mystic by
their too learned translators. The Egyptians revered the Divine Spirit,
the One-Only One, as <span class="smcap">Nout</span>. It is most evident that it is from that word
that Anaxagoras borrowed his denominative <i>nous</i>, or, as he calls it, Νοῦς αυτοκρατης—the
 Mind or Spirit self-potent, the αρχητης κινησεως. “All
things,” says he, “were in chaos; then came Νοῦς and introduced order.”
He also denominated this Νοῦς the One that ruled the many. In his
idea Νοῦς was God; and the <i>Logos</i> was man, the emanation of the former.
The external powers perceived <i>phenomena</i>; the <i>nous</i> alone recognized

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>

<i>noumena</i> or subjective things. This is purely Buddhistic and
esoteric.</p>

<p>Here Socrates took his clew and followed it, and Plato after him,
with the whole world of interior knowledge. Where the old Ionico-Italian
world culminated in Anaxagoras, the new world began with
Socrates and Plato. Pythagoras made the <em>Soul</em> a self-moving unit, with
three elements, the <i>nous</i>, the <i>phren</i> and the <i>thumos</i>; the latter two,
shared with the brutes; the former only, being his essential <em>self</em>. So the
charge that he taught transmigration is refuted; he taught no more than
Gautama-Buddha ever did, whatever the popular superstition of the
Hindu rabble made of it after his death. Whether Pythagoras borrowed
from Buddha, or Buddha from somebody else, matters not; the esoteric
doctrine is the same.</p>

<p>The Platonic School is even more distinct in enunciating all this.</p>

<p>The real selfhood was at the basis of all. Socrates therefore taught
that he had a δαιμόνιον (<i>daimonion</i>), a spiritual something which put him
in the road to wisdom. He himself knew nothing, but this put him in
the way to learn all.</p>

<p>Plato followed him with a full investigation of the principles of being.
There was an <i>Agathon</i>, Supreme God, who produced in his own mind a
<em>paradeigma</em> of all things.</p>

<p>He taught that in man was “the immortal principle of the soul,” a
mortal body, and a “separate mortal kind of soul,” which was placed in
a separate receptacle of the body from the other; the immortal part was
in the head (<cite>Timæus</cite> <abbr title="nineteen">xix.</abbr>,
 <abbr title="twenty">xx.</abbr>) the other in the trunk (<abbr title="forty-four">xliv.</abbr>).</p>

<p>Nothing is plainer than that Plato regarded the interior man as constituted
of two parts—one always the same, formed of the same entity as
Deity, and one mortal and corruptible.</p>

<p>“Plato and Pythagoras,” says Plutarch, “distribute the soul into two
parts, the rational (noëtic) and irrational (<i>agnoia</i>); that that part of
the soul of man which is rational, is eternal; for though it be not God,
yet it is the product of an eternal deity, but that part of the soul which
is divested of reason (<i>agnoia</i>) dies.”</p>

<p>“Man,” says Plutarch, “is compound; and they are mistaken who think
him to be compounded of two parts only. For they imagine that the
understanding is a part of the soul, but they err in this no less than those
who make the soul to be a part of the body, for the understanding (<i>nous</i>)
as far exceeds the soul, as the soul is better and diviner than the body.
Now this composition of the soul (φυχη) with the understanding (νοῦς)
makes reason; and with the body, passion; of which the one is the beginning
or principle of pleasure and pain, and the other of virtue and
vice. Of these three parts conjoined and compacted together, the earth

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>

has given the body, the moon the soul, and the sun the understanding to
the generation of man.</p>

<p>“Now of the deaths we die, <em>the one makes man two of three</em>, and the
other, <em>one</em> of (out of) two. The former is in the region and jurisdiction
of Demeter, whence the name given to the Mysteries τελειν resembled that
given to death, τελευταν. The Athenians also heretofore called the deceased
sacred to Demeter. As for the <em>other death</em> it is in the moon or
region of Persophoné. And as with the one the terrestrial, so with the
other the celestial Hermes doth dwell. This suddenly and with violence
plucks the soul from the body; but Proserpina mildly and in a long time
disjoins the understanding from the soul. For this reason she is called
<i>Monogenes</i>, <i>only-begotten</i>, or rather <i>begetting one alone</i>; for the better
part of man becomes alone when it is separated by her. Now both the
one and the other happens thus according to nature. It is ordained by
Faith that every soul, whether with or without understanding (νοῦς), when
gone out of the body, should wander for a time, though not all for the same,
in the region lying between the earth and moon. For those that have been
unjust and dissolute suffer there the punishment due to their offences;
but the good and virtuous are there detained till they are purified, and
have, by expiation, purged out of them all the infections they might have
contracted from the contagion of the body, as if from foul health, living in
the mildest part of the air, called the Meadows of Hades, where they must
remain for a certain prefixed and appointed time. And then, as if they
were returning from a wandering pilgrimage or long exile into their country,
they have a taste of joy, such as they principally receive who are initiated
into Sacred Mysteries, mixed with trouble, admiration, and each
one’s proper and peculiar hope.”</p>

<p>The <i>dæmonium</i> of Socrates was this νοῦς, mind, spirit, or understanding
of the divine in it. “The νοῦς of Socrates,” says Plutarch, “was pure
and mixed itself with the body no more than necessity required.... Every
soul hath some portion of νοῦς, reason, a man cannot be a man without it;
but as much of each soul as is mixed with flesh and appetite is changed
and through pain or pleasure becomes irrational. Every soul doth not mix
herself after one sort; some plunge themselves into the body, and so, in
this life their whole frame is corrupted by appetite and passion; others
are mixed as to some part, but the purer part [nous] still remains <em>without
the body</em>. It is not drawn down into the body, but it swims above and
touches (overshadows) the extremest part of the man’s head; it is like a
cord to hold up and direct the subsiding part of the soul, as long as it
proves obedient and is not overcome by the appetites of the flesh. The
part that is plunged into the body is called <i>soul</i>. But the incorruptible
part is called the <i>nous</i> and <em>the vulgar think it is within them</em>, as they

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>

likewise imagine the image reflected from a glass to be in that glass. But
the more intelligent, who know it to be without, call it a Daëmon” (a
god, a spirit).</p>

<p>“The soul, like to a dream, flies quick away, which it does not immediately,
as soon as it is separated from the body, but afterward, when it is
alone and divided from the understanding (<i>nous</i>).... The soul being
moulded and formed by the understanding (<i>nous</i>), and itself moulding and
forming the body, by embracing it on every side, receives from it an impression
and form; so that although it be separated both from the understanding
and the body, it nevertheless so retains still its figure and resemblance
for a long time, that it may, with good right, be called its
image.</p>

<p>“And of these souls the moon is the element, because souls resolve
into her, as the bodies of the deceased do into earth. Those, indeed, who
have been virtuous and honest, living a quiet and philosophical life, without
embroiling themselves in troublesome affairs, are quickly resolved;
because, being left by the nous, understanding, and no longer using the
corporeal passions, they incontinently vanish away.”</p>

<p>We find even Irenæus, that untiring and mortal enemy of every
Grecian and “heathen” heresy, explain his belief in the trinity of man.
The perfect man, according to his views, consists of <i>flesh</i>, <i>soul</i>, and <i>spirit</i>.
<span lang="la">“... carne, anima, spiritu, altero quidem figurante, spiritu, altero quod
formatur, carne. Id vero quod inter haec est duo, est anima, quae
aliquando subsequens spiritum elevatur ab eo, aliquando autem consentient
carni in terrenas concupiscentias”</span> (<cite>Irenæus</cite> <abbr title="five">v.</abbr>, 1).</p>

<p>And Origen, in his <cite>Sixth Epistle to the Romans</cite>, says: “There is a
threefold partition of man, the body or flesh, the lowest part of our
nature, on which the old serpent by original sin inscribed the law of sin,
and by which we are tempted to vile things, and as oft as we are overcome
by temptations are joined fast to the Devil; the spirit, in or by
which we express the likeness of the divine nature in which the very Best
Creator, from the archetype of his own mind, engraved with his finger
(that is, his spirit), the eternal law of honesty; by this we are joined (conglutinated)
to God and made one with God. In the third, the soul mediates
between these, which, as in a factious republic, cannot but join with
one party or the other, is solicited this way and that and is at liberty to
choose the side to which it will adhere. If, renouncing the flesh, it betakes
itself to the party of the spirit it will itself become spiritual, but if it cast
itself down to the cupidities of the flesh it will degenerate itself into
body.”</p>

<p>Plato (in <cite>Laws</cite> <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr>) defines <i>soul</i> as “the motion that is able to move
itself.” “Soul is the most ancient of all things, and the commencement

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>

of motion.” “Soul was generated prior to body, and body is posterior
and secondary, as being, according to nature, ruled over by the ruling
soul.” “The soul which administers all things that are moved in every
way, administers likewise the heavens.”</p>

<p>“Soul then leads everything in heaven, and on earth, and in the sea,
by its movements—the names of which are, to will, to consider, to take
care of, to consult, to form opinions true and false, to be in a state of joy,
sorrow, confidence, fear, hate, love, together with all such primary movements
as are allied to these ... being a goddess herself, she ever takes as
an ally <span class="smcap">Nous</span>, a god, and disciplines all things correctly and happily; but
when with <i>Annoia</i>—not <i>nous</i>—it works out everything the contrary.”</p>

<p>In this language, as in the Buddhist texts, the negative is treated as
essential existence. <em>Annihilation</em> comes under a similar exegesis. The
positive state, is essential being but no manifestation as such. When the
spirit, in Buddhistic parlance, entered <i>nirvana</i>, it lost objective existence
but retained subjective. To objective minds this is becoming absolute
nothing; to subjective, <span class="allsmcap">NO</span>-thing, nothing to be displayed to sense.</p>

<p>These rather lengthy quotations are necessary for our purpose.
Better than anything else, they show the agreement between the oldest
“Pagan” philosophies—not “assisted by the light of divine revelation,”
to use the curious expression of Laboulaye in relation to Buddha—and
the early Christianity of some Fathers. Both Pagan philosophy and
Christianity, however, owe their elevated ideas on the soul and spirit of
man and the unknown Deity to Buddhism and the Hindu Manu. No wonder
that the Manicheans maintained that Jesus was a permutation of
Gautama; that Buddha, Christ, and Mani were one and the same
 <span class="lock">person,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_592" id="FNanchor_592">[592]</a></span>
for the teachings of the former two were identical. It was the doctrine
of old India that Jesus held to when preaching the complete renunciation
of the world and its vanities in order to reach the kingdom of Heaven,
Nirvana, where “men neither marry nor are given in marriage, but live
like the angels.”</p>

<p>It is the philosophy of Siddhârtha-Buddha again that Pythagoras
expounded, when asserting that the <i>ego</i> (νοῦς) was eternal with God, and
that the soul only passed through various stages (Hindu <i>Rupa-locas</i>) to arrive
at the divine excellence; meanwhile the <i>thumos</i> returned to the earth, and
even the <i>phren</i> was eliminated. Thus the <em>metempsychosis</em> was only a
succession of disciplines through refuge-heavens (called by the Buddhists
 <span class="lock"><i>Zion</i>),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_593" id="FNanchor_593">[593]</a></span>
 to work off the exterior mind, to rid the <i>nous</i> of the <i>phren</i>, or soul,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>

the Buddhist “Winyanaskandaya,” <em>that principle that lives</em> from <i>Karma</i>
and the Skandhas (groups). It is the latter, the metaphysical personations
of the “deeds” of man, whether good or bad, which, after the death of
his body, incarnate themselves, so to say, and form their many invisible but
never-dying compounds into a new body, or rather into an ethereal being,
the <em>double</em> of what man was <em>morally</em>. It is the astral body of the kabalist
and the “incarnated deeds” which form the new sentient self as his
<i>Ahancara</i> (the ego, self-consciousness), given to him by the sovereign
Master (the breath of God) can never perish, for it is immortal <i lang="la">per se</i> as
a spirit; hence the sufferings of the newly-born <em>self</em> till he rids himself of
every earthly thought, desire, and passion.</p>

<p>We now see that the “four mysteries” of the Buddhist doctrine have
been as little understood and appreciated as the “wisdom” hinted at by
Paul, and spoken “among them that are <em>perfect</em>” (initiated), the “mystery-wisdom”
which “none of the <i>Archons</i> of this world
 <span class="lock">knew.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_594" id="FNanchor_594">[594]</a></span>
 The
fourth degree of the Buddhist Dhyâna, the fruit of Samâdhi, which leads
to the utmost perfection, to <i>Viconddham</i>, a term correctly rendered by
Burnouf in the verb
 <span class="lock">“<i>perfected</i>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_595" id="FNanchor_595">[595]</a></span>
 is wholly misunderstood by others, as
well as in himself. Defining the condition of Dhyâna, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilaire argues
thus:</p>

<p>“Finally, having attained the fourth degree, the ascetic possesses no
more this feeling of beatitude, however obscure it may be ... he has
also lost all memory ... he has reached impassibility, as near a neighbor
of Nirvana as can be.... However, this absolute impassibility does not
hinder the ascetic from acquiring, at this very moment, <em>omniscience and the
magical power; a flagrant contradiction, about which the Buddhists</em> no
more disturb themselves than about so many
 <span class="lock">others.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_596" id="FNanchor_596">[596]</a></span></p>

<p>And why should they, when these contradictions are, in fact, no contradictions
at all? It ill behooves us to speak of contradictions in other
peoples’ religions, when those of our own have bred, besides the three
great conflicting bodies of Romanism, Protestantism, and the Eastern
Church, a thousand and one most curious smaller sects. However it
may be, we have here a term applied to one and the same thing by the
Buddhist holy “mendicants” and Paul, the Apostle. When the latter
says: “If so be that I might attain the <em>resurrection</em> from among the
dead [the Nirvana], not as though I had already attained, or were already
<em>perfect</em>”
 <span class="lock">(initiated),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_597" id="FNanchor_597">[597]</a></span>
 he uses an expression common among the initiated
Buddhists. When a Buddhist ascetic has reached the “fourth degree,” he
is considered a rahat. He produces every kind of phenomena by the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>

sole power of his freed spirit. A <i>rahat</i>, say the Buddhists, is one who has
acquired the power of flying in the air, becoming invisible, commanding
the elements, and working all manner of wonders, commonly, and as erroneously,
called <i>meipo</i> (miracles). He is a <em>perfect</em> man, a demi-god. A
god he will become when he reaches Nirvana; for, like the initiates
of both Testaments, the worshippers of Buddha know that they “are
gods.”</p>

<p>“Genuine Buddhism, overleaping the barrier between finite and infinite
mind, urges its followers to aspire, <em>by their own efforts</em>, to that divine
perfectibility of which it teaches that man is capable, and by attaining
which man becomes <em>a god</em>,” says Brian Houghton
 <span class="lock">Hodgson.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_598" id="FNanchor_598">[598]</a></span></p>

<p>Dreary and sad were the ways, and blood-covered the tortuous paths
by which the world of the Christians was driven to embrace the Irenæan
and Eusebian Christianity. And yet, unless we accept the views of the
ancient Pagans, what claim has our generation to having solved any of
the mysteries of the “kingdom of heaven?” What more does the most
pious and learned of Christians know of the future destiny and progress
of our immortal spirits than the heathen philosopher of old, or the
modern “Pagan” beyond the Himalaya? Can he even boast that he
knows as much, although he works in the full blaze of “divine” revelation?
We have seen a Buddhist holding to the religion of his fathers, both
in theory and practice; and, however blind may be his faith, however
absurd his notions on some particular doctrinal points, later engraftings
of an ambitious clergy, yet in practical works his Buddhism is far more
Christ-like in deed and spirit than the average life of our Christian priests
and ministers. The fact alone that his religion commands him to “honor
his own faith, but never slander that of other
 <span class="lock">people,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_599" id="FNanchor_599">[599]</a></span>
 is sufficient. It
places the Buddhist lama immeasurably higher than any priest or clergyman
who deems it his sacred duty to curse the “heathen” to his face,
and sentence him and his religion to “eternal damnation.” Christianity
becomes every day more a religion of pure emotionalism. The doctrine
of Buddha is entirely based on practical works. A general love of all
beings, human and animal, is its nucleus. A man who knows that unless he
toils for himself he has to starve, and understands that he has no scapegoat
to carry the burden of his iniquities for him, is ten times as likely to
become a better man than one who is taught that murder, theft, and profligacy
can be washed in one instant as white as snow, if he but believes
in a God who, to borrow an expression of Volney, “once took food upon
earth, and is now himself the food of his people.”</p>

of them—Freemasonry <em>not</em> excepted—was and still is accused of
demonolatry, blasphemy, and licentiousness.</p>

<p>Our object is not to write the history of either of them; but only to
compare these sorely-abused communities with the Christian sects, past
and present, and then, taking historical facts for our guidance, to defend
the secret science as well as the men who are its students and champions
against any unjust imputation.</p>

<p>One by one the tide of time engulfed the sects of the early centuries,
until of the whole number only one survived in its primitive integrity.
That one still exists, still teaches the doctrine of its founder, still exemplifies
its faith in works of power. The quicksands which swallowed up

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>

every other outgrowth of the religious agitation of the times of Jesus, with
its records, relics, and traditions, proved firm ground for this. Driven
from their native land, its members found refuge in Persia, and to day
the anxious traveller may converse with the direct descendants of the
“Disciples of John,” who listened, on the Jordan’s shore, to the “man
sent from God,” and were baptized and believed. This curious people,
numbering 30,000 or more, are miscalled “Christians of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John,” but
in fact should be known by their old name of Nazareans, or their new one
of Mendæans.</p>

<p>To term them Christians, is wholly unwarranted. They neither believe
in Jesus as Christ, nor accept his atonement, nor adhere to his
Church, nor revere its “Holy Scriptures.” Neither do they worship the
Jehovah-God of the Jews and Christians, a circumstance which of course
proves that their founder, John the Baptist, did not worship him either.
And if not, what right has he to a place in the <cite>Bible</cite>, or in the portrait-gallery
of Christian saints? Still further, if Ferho was his God, and he
was “a man sent by God,” he must have been sent by Lord Ferho, and
in his name baptized and preached? Now, if Jesus was baptized by
John, the inference is that he was baptized according to his own faith;
therefore, Jesus too, was a believer in Ferho, or Faho, as they call him;
a conclusion that seems the more warranted by his silence as to the name
of his “Father.” And why should the hypothesis that <i>Faho</i> is but one
of the many corruptions of Fho or Fo, as the Thibetans and Chinese call
Buddha, appear ridiculous? In the North of Nepaul, Buddha is more
often called <i>Fo</i> than <i>Buddha</i>. The Book of <cite>Mahawānsa</cite> shows how
early the work of Buddhistic proselytism began in Nepaul; and history
teaches that Buddhist monks crowded into
 <span class="lock">Syria<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_600" id="FNanchor_600">[600]</a></span>
 and Babylon in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>

century preceding our era, and that Buddhasp (Bodhisatva) the alleged
Chaldean, was the founder of Sabism or
 <span class="lock"><em>baptism</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_601" id="FNanchor_601">[601]</a></span></p>

<p>What the actual Baptists, <i>el-Mogtasila</i>, or Nazareans, do believe, is
fully set forth in other places, for they are the very Nazarenes of whom
we have spoken so much, and from whose <cite>Codex</cite> we have quoted. Persecuted
and threatened with annihilation, they took refuge in the Nestorian
body, and so allowed themselves to be arbitrarily classed as Christians,
but as soon as opportunity offered, they separated, and now, for
several centuries have not even nominally deserved the appellation.
That they are, nevertheless, so called by ecclesiastical writers, is perhaps
not very difficult to comprehend. They know too much of early Christianity
to be left outside the pale, to bear witness against it with their
traditions, without the stigma of heresy and backsliding being fastened
upon them to weaken confidence in what they might say.</p>

<p>But where else can science find so good a field for biblical research as
among this too neglected people? No doubt of their inheritance of the
Baptist’s doctrine; their traditions are without a break. What they teach
now, their forefathers taught at every epoch where they appear in history.
They are the disciples of that John who is said to have foretold the
advent of Jesus, baptized him, and declared that the latchet of his shoe
he (John) was not worthy to unloose. As they two—the Messenger and
the Messiah—stood in the Jordan, and the elder was consecrating the
younger—his own cousin, too, humanly speaking—the heavens opened
and God Himself, in the shape of a dove, descended in a glory upon his
“Beloved Son!” How then, if this tale be true, can we account for the
strange infidelity which we find among these surviving Nazareans? So
far from believing Jesus the Only Begotten Son of God, they actually
told the Persian missionaries, who, in the seventeenth century, first discovered
them to Europeans, that the Christ of the <cite>New Testament</cite> was
“a false teacher,” and that the Jewish system, as well as that of Jesus (?),
came from the realm of darkness! Who knows better than they?
Where can more competent living witnesses be found? Christian ecclesiastics

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>

would force upon us an anointed Saviour heralded by John, and
the disciples of this very Baptist, from the earliest centuries, have stigmatized
this ideal personage as an impostor, and his putative Father, Jehovah,
“a spurious God,” the Ilda-Baoth of the Ophites! Unlucky for
Christianity will be the day when some fearless and honest scholar shall
persuade their elders to let him translate the contents of their secret
books and compile their hoary traditions! It is a strange delusion that
makes some writers think that the Nazareans have no other sacred literature,
no other literary relics than four doctrinal works, and that curious
volume full of astrology and magic which they are bound to peruse at
the sunset hour, on every Sol’s day (Sunday).</p>

<p>This search after truth leads us, indeed, into devious ways. Many are
the obstacles that ecclesiastical cunning has placed in the way of our finding
the primal source of religious ideas. Christianity is on trial, and has
been, ever since science felt strong enough to act as Public Prosecutor.
A portion of the case we are drafting in this book. What of truth is there
in this Theology? Through what sects has it been transmitted? <em>Whence
was it primarily derived?</em> To answer, we must trace the history of the
World Religion, alike through the secret Christian sects as through those of
other great religious subdivisions of the race; <em>for the Secret Doctrine is
the Truth</em>, and that religion is nearest divine that has contained it with
least adulteration.</p>

<p>Our search takes us hither and thither, but never aimlessly do we
bring sects widely separated in chronological order, into critical juxtaposition.
There is one purpose in our work to be kept constantly in
view—the analysis of religious beliefs, and the definition of their descent
from the past to the present. What has most blocked the way is Roman
Catholicism; and not until the secret principles of this religion are
uncovered can we comprehend the iron staff upon which it leans to
steady its now tottering steps.</p>

<p>We will begin with the Ophites, Nazareans, and the modern Druzes.
The personal views of the author, as they will be presented in the
diagrams, will be most decidedly at variance with the prejudiced speculations
of Irenæus, Theodoret, and Epiphanius (the sainted renegade,
who sold his brethren), inasmuch as they will reflect the ideas of certain
kabalists in close relations with the mysterious Druzes of Mount
Lebanon. The Syrian <i>okhals</i>, or Spiritualists, as they are sometimes
termed, are in possession of a great many ancient manuscripts and
gems, bearing upon our present subject.</p>

<p>The first <em>scheme</em>—that of the Ophites—from the very start, as we have
shown, varies from the description given by the Fathers, inasmuch as
it makes Bythos or depth, a female emanation, and assigns her a place

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>

answering to that of Pleroma, only in a far superior region; whereas,
the Fathers assure us that the Gnostics gave the name of Bythos to the
First Cause. As in the kabalistic system, it represents the boundless
and infinite void within which is concealed in darkness the Unknown
Primal motor of all. It envelops <span class="smcap">Him</span> like a veil: in short we recognize
again the “Shekinah” of the En-Soph. Alone, the name of ΙΑΩ,
Iao, marks the upper centre, or rather the presumed spot where the
Unknown One may be supposed to dwell. Around the Iao, runs the
legend, <span lang="el">ϹΕΜΕϹ ΕΙΛΑΜ ΑΒΡΑΣΑΞ</span>. “The eternal Sun-Abrasax” (the
Central Spiritual Sun of all the kabalists, represented in some diagrams
of the latter by the circle of Tiphereth).</p>

<p>From this region of unfathomable Depth, issues forth a circle formed
of spirals; which, in the language of symbolism, means a grand cycle,
κυκλος, composed of smaller ones. Coiled within, so as to follow the
spirals, lies the serpent—emblem of wisdom and eternity—the Dual
Androgyne: the cycle representing <i>Ennoia</i> or the Divine mind, and the
Serpent—the Agathodaimon, Ophis—the Shadow of the Light. Both
were the Logoï of the Ophites; or the unity as Logos manifesting itself
as a double principle of good and evil; for, according to their views, these
two principles are immutable, and existed from all eternity, as they will
ever continue to exist.</p>

<p>This symbol accounts for the adoration by this sect of the Serpent,
as the Saviour, coiled either around the Sacramental loaf or a Tau. As
a unity, Ennoia and Ophis are the Logos; when separated, one is the
Tree of Life (Spiritual); the other, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and
Evil. Therefore, we find Ophis urging the first human couple—the material
production of Ilda-Baoth, but which owed its spiritual principle to
Sophia-Achamoth—to eat of the forbidden fruit, although Ophis represents
Divine Wisdom.</p>

<p>The Serpent, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree
of Life, are all symbols transplanted from the soil of India. The Arasa-Maram,
the banyan tree, so sacred with the Hindus, since Vishnu, during
one of his incarnations, reposed under its mighty shade, and there taught
humanity philosophy and sciences, is called the Tree of Knowledge and
the Tree of Life. Under the protective umbrage of this king of the
forests, the Gurus teach their pupils their first lessons on immortality and
initiate them in the mysteries of life and death. The <i>Java</i>-<span class="smcap">Aleim</span> of
the Sacerdotal College are said, in the Chaldean tradition, to have taught
the sons of men to become like one of them. To the present day
 <span class="lock">Foh-tchou,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_602" id="FNanchor_602">[602]</a></span>
 who lives in his Foh-Maëyu, or temple of Buddha, on the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
top of
 <span class="lock">“Kouin-long-sang,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_603" id="FNanchor_603">[603]</a></span>
 the great mountain, produces his greatest
religious miracles under a tree called in Chinese Sung-Ming-Shŭ, or the
Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life, for ignorance is death, and
knowledge alone gives immortality. This marvellous display takes
place every three years, when an immense concourse of Chinese Buddhists
assemble in pilgrimage at the holy place.</p>

<p>Ilda-Baoth, the “Son of Darkness,” and the creator of the material
world, was made to inhabit the planet Saturn, which identifies him still
more with the Jewish Jehovah, who was Saturn himself, according to
the Ophites, and is by them denied his Sinaitic name. From Ilda-Baoth
emanate six spirits, who respectively dwell with their father in the seven
planets. These are Saba—or Mars; Adonai—Sol, or the
 <span class="lock">Sun;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_604" id="FNanchor_604">[604]</a></span>
 Ievo—the
Moon; Eloi—Jupiter; Astaphoi—Mercury (spirit of water); and
Ouraïos—Venus, spirit of
 <span class="lock">fire.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_605" id="FNanchor_605">[605]</a></span></p>

<p>In their functions and description as given, these seven planets are
identical with the Hindu <i>Sapta-Loca</i>, the seven places or spheres, or the
superior and inferior worlds; for they represent the kabalistic seven
spheres. With the Ophites, they belong to the lower spheres. The
monograms of these Gnostic planets are also Buddhistic, the latter differing,
albeit slightly, from those of the usual astrological “houses.” In
the explanatory notes which accompany the diagram, the names of Cirenthius
(the disciple of Simon Magus), of Menander, and of certain other
Gnostics, whose names are not to be met with in the Patristic writings,
are often mentioned; such as Parcha (Ferho), for
 <span class="lock">instance.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_606" id="FNanchor_606">[606]</a></span></p>

<p>The author of the diagram claims, moreover, for his sect, the greatest
antiquity, bringing forward, as a proof, that their “forefathers” were
the builders of all the “Dracontia” temples, even of those beyond “the
great waters.” He asserts that the “Just One,” who was the mouthpiece
of the Eternal Æon (Christos), himself sent his disciples into the
world, placing them under the double protection of Sige (Silence, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span>

Logos), and Ophis, the Agathodæmon. The author alludes, no doubt,
to the favorite expression of Jesus, “be wise as serpents, and harmless
as doves.” On the diagram, Ophis is represented as the Egyptian Cnuphis
or Kneph, called Dracontiæ. He appears as a serpent standing
erect on its tail, with a lion’s head, crowned and radiated, and bearing
on the point of each ray one of the seven Greek vowels—symbol of the
seven celestial spheres. This figure is quite familiar to those who are
acquainted with the Gnostic
 <span class="lock">gems,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_607" id="FNanchor_607">[607]</a></span>
 and is borrowed from the Egyptian
<i>Hermetic books</i>. The description given in the <cite>Revelation</cite>, of one “like
unto the Son of Man,” with his seven stars, and who is the Logos, is
another form of Ophis.</p>

<p>The Nazarene diagram, except in a change of names, is identical with
that of the Gnostics, who evidently borrowed their ideas from it, adding a
few appellations from the Basiledean and Valentinian systems. To avoid
repetition, we will now simply present the two in parallel.</p>

<p>Thus, we find that, in the Nazarene Cosmogony, the names of their
powers and genii stand in the following relations to those of the
Gnostics:</p>

<p>Moreover, the Ophite seven planetary genii, who emanated one from
the other, are found again in the Nazarene religion, under the name of
the “seven impostor-dæmons,” or stellars, who “will deceive all the
sons of Adam.” These are <i>Sol</i>; <i>Spiritus Venereus</i> (Holy Spirit, in her
material
 <span class="lock">aspect),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_609" id="FNanchor_609">[609]</a></span>
 the mother of the “seven badly-disposed stellars,”
answering to the Gnostic Achamoth; <i>Nebu</i>, or Mercury, “a false Messiah,
who will deprave the ancient worship of God;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_610" id="FNanchor_610">[610]</a> <span class="smcap">Sin</span> (or Luna,
or Shuril); <span class="smcap">Kiun</span> (Kivan, or Saturn); Bel-Jupiter; and the seventh,
<i>Nerig</i>, Mars (<cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 57).</p>

<p>The Christos of the Gnostics is the chief of the seven Æons, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John’s seven spirits of God; the Nazarenes have also their seven genii
or good Æons, whose chief is <i>Rex Lucis</i>, <span class="smcap">Mano</span>, their Christos. The
<i>Sapta Rishis</i>, the seven sages of India, inhabit the <i>Sapta-Poura</i>, or the
seven celestial cities.</p>

<p>What less or more do we find in the Universal Ecclesia, until the days
of the Reformation, and in the Roman Popish Church after the separation?
We have compared the relative value of the Hindu Cosmogony; the
Chaldeo, Zoroastrian, Jewish <cite>Kabala</cite>; and that of the so-termed Hæretics.
A correct diagram of the Judaico-<span class="smcap">Christian</span> religion, to enforce which
on the heathen who have furnished it, are expended such great sums
every year, would still better prove the identity of the two; but we lack
space and are also spared the necessity of proving what is already thoroughly
demonstrated.</p>

<p>In the Ophite gems of King (<cite>Gnostics</cite>), we find the name of Iao repeated,
and often confounded with that of Ievo, while the latter simply
represents one of the genii antagonistic to Abraxas. In order that these
names may not be taken as identical with the name of the Jewish Jehovah
we will at once explain this word. It seems to us surpassingly strange
that so many learned archæologists should have so little insisted that
there was more than one Jehovah, and disclaimed that the name originated

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span>

with Moses. Iao is certainly a title of the Supreme Being, and belongs
<em>partially</em> to the Ineffable Name; but it neither originated with nor
was it the sole property of the Jews. Even if it had pleased Moses to
bestow the name upon the tutelar “Spirit,” the alleged protector and
national deity of the “Chosen people of Israel,” there is yet no possible
reason why other nationalities should receive Him as the Highest and
One-living God. But we deny the assumption altogether. Besides, there
is the fact that Yaho or Iao was a “mystery name” from the beginning, יהוה and <a id="hebrew12"></a> יה never
came into use before King David. Anterior to his
time, few or no proper names were compounded with <i>iah</i> or jah. It
looks rather as though David, being a sojourner among the Tyrians and
Philistines (<cite>2 Samuel</cite>), brought thence the name of Jehovah. He made
Zadok high-priest, from whom came the Zadokites or Sadducees. He
lived and ruled first at Hebron חברון, Habir-on or Kabeir-town, where the
rites of the four (mystery-gods) were celebrated. Neither David nor
Solomon recognized either Moses or the law of Moses. They aspired to
build a temple to יהוה, like the structures erected by Hiram to Hercules
and Venus, Adon and Astarte.</p>

<p>Says Fürst: “The very ancient name of God, Yâho, written in the
Greek Ιαω, appears, apart <em>from its derivation</em>, to have been an old mystic
name of the Supreme deity of the Shemites. (Hence it was told to
Moses when initiated at <span class="smcap">Hor-eb</span>—the <i>cave</i>, under the direction of Jethro,
the Kenite or Cainite priest of Midian.) In an old religion of the Chaldeans,
whose remains are to be found amongst the Neo-platonists, the
highest divinity enthroned above the seven heavens, representing the
Spiritual Light-Principle
 <span class="lock">(<i>nous</i>)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_611" id="FNanchor_611">[611]</a></span>
    and also conceived as
 <span class="lock">Demiurgus,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_612" id="FNanchor_612">[612]</a></span>
was called Ιαω יחד, who was, like the Hebrew Yâho, mysterious and unmentionable,
and whose name was communicated to the initiated. The
Phœnicians had a Supreme God whose name was trilateral and <em>secret</em>, and
he was <span class="lock">Ιαω.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_613" id="FNanchor_613">[613]</a></span></p>

<p>But while Fürst insists that the name has a Semitic origin, there are
other scholars who trace it farther than he does, and look back beyond
the classification of the Caucasians.</p>

<p>In Sanscrit we have Jah and Jaya, or Jaa and Ja-ga, and this throws
light on the origin of the famous festival of the car of Jaga-nath, commonly
called Jaggernâth. Javhe means “he who is,” and Dr. Spiegel
traces even the Persian name of God, “Ahura,” to the root
 <span class="lock"><i>ah</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_614" id="FNanchor_614">[614]</a></span>
 which

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>

in Sanscrit is pronounced <i>as</i>, to breathe, and <i>asu</i>, became, therefore, in
time, synonymous with
 <span class="lock">“Spirit.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_615" id="FNanchor_615">[615]</a></span>
 Rawlinson strongly supports the
opinion of an Aryan or Vedic influence on the early Babylonian mythology.
We have given, a few pages back, the strongest possible proofs of
the identity of Vishnu with Dag-on. The same may be adduced for the
title of Ιαω, and its Sanscrit root traced in every country. <span class="smcap">Ju</span> or <i>Jovis</i>
is the oldest Latin name for God. “As male he is Ju-<i>piter</i>, or <i>Ju</i>, the
father, pitär being Sanscrit for father; as feminine, Ju-<i>no</i> or Ju, the
comforter—דוח being the Phœnician word for rest and
 <span class="lock">comfort.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_616" id="FNanchor_616">[616]</a></span>
 Professor
Max Müller shows that although “Dyaus,” sky, does not occur as
a masculine in the ordinary Sanscrit, yet it does occur in the <cite>Veda</cite>, “and
thus bears witness to the early Aryan worship of Dyaus, the Greek
Zeus” (<cite>The Veda</cite>).</p>

<p>To grasp the real and primitive sense of the term ΙΑΩ, and the reason
of its becoming the designation for the most mysterious of all deities, we
must search for its origin in the figurative phraseology of all the primitive
people. We must first of all go to the most ancient sources for our
information. In one of the <cite>Books of Hermes</cite>, for instance, we find him
saying that the number <span class="allsmcap">TEN</span> is the mother of the soul, and that the <em>life</em>
and <em>light</em> are therein united. For “the number 1 (one) is born from the
spirit, and the number 10 (ten) from
 <span class="lock">matter;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_617" id="FNanchor_617">[617]</a></span>
 “the unity has made
the <span class="allsmcap">TEN</span>, the <span class="allsmcap">TEN</span> the <span class="lock">unity.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_618" id="FNanchor_618">[618]</a></span></p>

<p>The kabalistic <i>gemantria</i>—one of the methods for extracting the hidden
meaning from letters, words, and sentences—is arithmetical. It
consists in applying to the letters of a word the sense they bear as numbers,
in <em>outward</em> shape as well as in their individual sense. Moreover,
by the <i>Themura</i> (another method used by the kabalists) any word could
be made to yield its mystery out of its anagram. Thus, we find the author
of <cite>Sepher Jezira</cite> saying, one or two centuries before our
 <span class="lock">era:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_619" id="FNanchor_619">[619]</a></span>
 “<span class="smcap">One</span>,
the spirit of the <i>Alahim</i> of
 <span class="lock">Lives.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_620" id="FNanchor_620">[620]</a></span>
 So again, in the oldest kabalistic
diagrams, the <em>ten</em> Sephiroth are represented as wheels or circles, and
Adam Kadmon, the primitive man, as an <em>upright</em> pillar. “Wheels and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>

seraphim and the holy creatures” (chioth), says Rabbi
 <span class="lock">Akiba.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_621" id="FNanchor_621">[621]</a></span>
 In
another system of the same branch of the symbolical <cite>Kabala</cite>, called Athbach—which
arranges the letters of the alphabet by pairs in three rows—all
the couples in the first row bear the numerical value <em>ten</em>; and in the
system of Simeon
 <span class="lock">Ben-Shetah,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_622" id="FNanchor_622">[622]</a></span>
 the uppermost couple—the most
sacred of all, is preceded by the Pythagorean cipher, one and a nought, or
zero—10.</p>

<p>If we can once appreciate the fact that, among all the peoples of
the highest antiquity, the most natural conception of the First Cause manifesting
itself in its creatures, and that to this they could not but ascribe
the creation of all, was that of an androgyne deity; that the male principle
was considered the vivifying invisible spirit, and the female, mother nature;
we shall be enabled to understand how that mysterious cause came at first
to be represented (in the picture-writings, perhaps) as the combination
of the Alpha and Omega of numbers, a decimal, then as IAO, a trilateral
name, containing in itself a deep allegory.</p>

<p><i>IAO</i>, in such a case, would—etymologically considered—mean
the “Breath of Life,” generated or springing forth between an upright
male and an egg-shaped female principle of nature; for, in Sanscrit, <i>as</i>
means “to be,” “to live or exist;” and originally it meant “to breathe.”
“From it,” says Max Müller, “in its original sense of breathing, the
Hindus formed ‘asu,’ breath, and ‘asura,’ the name of God, whether it
meant the breathing one or the giver of
 <span class="lock">breath.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_623" id="FNanchor_623">[623]</a></span>
 It certainly meant
the latter. In Hebrew, “Ah” and “Iah” mean life. Cornelius Agrippa,
in his treatise on the <cite>Preëminence of Woman</cite>, shows that “the word Eve
suggests comparison with the mystic symbols of the kabalists, the name
of the woman having affinity with the ineffable Tetragrammaton, the most
sacred name of the divinity.” Ancient names were always consonant
with the things they represented. In relation to the mysterious name of
the Deity in question, the hitherto inexplicable hint of the kabalists as to
the efficacy of the letter H, “which Abram took away from his wife
Sarah” and “put <em>into the middle of his own name</em>,” becomes clear.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be argued, by way of objection, that it is not ascertained
as yet at what period of antiquity the <em>nought</em> occurs for the first
time in Indian manuscripts or inscriptions. Be that as it may, the case
presents circumstantial evidence of too strong a character not to carry a
conviction of probability with it. According to Max Müller “the two
words ‘cipher’ and ‘zero,’ which are in reality but one ... are sufficient

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>

to prove that our figures are borrowed from the
 <span class="lock">Arabs.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_624" id="FNanchor_624">[624]</a></span>
 Cipher is the
Arabic “cifron,” and means <em>empty</em>, a translation of the Sanscrit name of
the nought “synya,” he says. The Arabs had their figures from Hindustan,
and never claimed the discovery for
 <span class="lock">themselves.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_625" id="FNanchor_625">[625]</a></span>
 As to the Pythagoreans,
we need but turn to the ancient manuscripts of Boëthius’s
<cite>Geometry</cite>, composed in the sixth century, to find in the Pythagorean
 <span class="lock">numerals<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_626" id="FNanchor_626">[626]</a></span>
 the 1 and the <em>nought</em>, as the first and final cipher. And Porphyry,
who quotes from the Pythagorean
 <span class="lock"><cite>Moderatus</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_627" id="FNanchor_627">[627]</a></span>
 says that the numerals
of Pythagoras were “hieroglyphical symbols, by means whereof
he explained ideas concerning the nature of things.”</p>

<p>Now, if the most ancient Indian manuscripts show as yet no trace of
decimal notation in them, Max Müller states very clearly that until now
he has found but nine letters (the initials of the Sanscrit numerals) in
them—on the other hand we have records as ancient to supply the wanted
proof. We speak of the sculptures and the sacred imagery in the most
ancient temples of the far East. Pythagoras derived his knowledge from
India; and we find Professor Max Müller corroborating this statement,
at least so far as allowing the <em>Neo</em>-Pythagoreans to have been the first
teachers of “ciphering” among the Greeks and Romans; that “they,
at Alexandria, or in Syria, became acquainted with the Indian figures,
and adapted them to the Pythagorean abacus” (our figures). This
cautious allowance implies that Pythagoras himself was acquainted with
but <em>nine</em> figures. So that we might reasonably answer that although we
possess no certain proof that the decimal notation was known to Pythagoras,
who lived on the very close of the archaic
 <span class="lock">ages,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_628" id="FNanchor_628">[628]</a></span>
 we yet have
sufficient evidence to show that the full numbers, as given by Boëthius,
were known to the Pythagoreans, even before Alexandria was
 <span class="lock">built.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_629" id="FNanchor_629">[629]</a></span>
This evidence we find in Aristotle, who says that “some philosophers
hold that ideas and numbers are of the same nature, and amount to <span class="allsmcap">TEN</span>
in
 <span class="lock">all.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_630" id="FNanchor_630">[630]</a></span>
 This, we believe, will be sufficient to show that the decimal
notation was known among them at least as early as four centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
for Aristotle does not seem to treat the question as an innovation of the
“Neo-Pythagoreans.”</p>

<p>Besides, as we have remarked above, the representations of the
archaic deities, on the walls of the temples, are of themselves quite suggestive
enough. So, for instance, Vishnu is represented in the Kurmavatara
(his second avatar) as a tortoise sustaining a circular pillar, on which
the semblance of himself (Maya, or the illusion) sits with all his attributes.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
While one hand holds a flower, another a club, the third a shell, the
fourth, generally the upper one, or at the right—holds on his forefinger, extended
as the cipher 1, the <i>chakra</i>, or discus, which resembles a ring, or
a wheel, and might be taken for the nought. In his first avatar, the
Matsyavatam, when emerging from the fish’s mouth, he is represented in
the same
 <span class="lock">position.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_631" id="FNanchor_631">[631]</a></span>
 The ten-armed Durga of Bengal; the ten-headed
Ravana, the giant; Parvati—as Durga, Indra, and Indrani, are found
with this attribute, which is a perfect representation of the
 <span class="lock">May-pole.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_632" id="FNanchor_632">[632]</a></span></p>

<p>The holiest of the temples among the Hindus, are those of Jaggarnâth.
This deity is worshipped equally by all the sects of India, and
<em>Jagg</em>arnâth is named “The Lord of the World.” He is the god of
the Mysteries, and his temples, which are most numerous in Bengal, are
all of a pyramidal form.</p>

<p>There is no other deity which affords such a variety of etymologies
as Iaho, nor a name which can be so variously pronounced. It is
only by associating it with the Masoretic points that the later Rabbins
succeeded in making Jehovah read “Adonaï”—or Lord. Philo Byblus
spells it in Greek letters ΙΕΥΩ—IEOV. Theodoret says that the
Samaritans pronounced it <i>Iabè</i> (<i>Yahva</i>) and the Jews Yaho; which
would make it as we have shown I-ah-O. Diodorus states that “among
the Jews they relate that Moses called the God <a id="Greekch5"></a>Ιαω.” It is on the
authority of the <cite>Bible</cite> itself, therefore, that we maintain that before his
initiation by Jethro, his father-in-law, Moses had never known the word
Iaho. The future Deity of the sons of Israel calls out from the burning
bush and gives His name as “I am that I am,” and specifies carefully
that He is the “Lord God of the Hebrews” (<abbr title="Exodus three"><cite>Exod.</cite> iii.</abbr> 18), not of the
other nations. Judging him by his own acts, throughout the Jewish
records, we doubt whether Christ himself, had he appeared in the days of
the <cite>Exodus</cite>, would have been welcomed by the irascible Sinaitic Deity.
However, “The Lord God,” who becomes, on His own confession, Jehovah
only in the 6th chapter of <cite>Exodus</cite> (verse 3) finds his veracity put to
a startling test in <cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="twenty-two">xxii.</abbr>
 14, in which <em>revealed</em> passage Abraham
builds an altar to <em>Jehovah-jireh</em>.</p>

<p>It would seem, therefore, but natural to make a difference between
the mystery-God Ιαω, adopted from the highest antiquity by all who participated
in the esoteric knowledge of the priests, and his phonetic counterparts,
whom we find treated with so little reverence by the Ophites
and other Gnostics. Once having burdened themselves like the Azazel

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>

of the wilderness with the sins and iniquities of the Jewish nation, it now
appears hard for the Christians to have to confess that those whom they
thought fit to consider the “chosen people” of God—their sole predecessors
in monotheism—were, till a very late period, as idolatrous and polytheistic
as their neighbors. The shrewd Talmudists have escaped the
accusation for long centuries by screening themselves behind the Masoretic
invention. But, as in everything else, truth was at last brought to
light. We know now that Ihoh יהוה must be read Iahoh and Iah, not
Jehovah. Iah of the Hebrews is plainly the Iacchos (Bacchus) of the
Mysteries; the God “from whom the liberation of souls was expected—Dionysus,
Iacchos, Iahoh,
 <span class="lock">Iah.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_633" id="FNanchor_633">[633]</a></span>
 Aristotle then was right when he
said: “Jon יהוה was Oromasdes and Ahriman Pluto, for the God of heaven,
Ahura-mazda, rides on a chariot which the <em>Horse of the Sun</em> follows.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_634" id="FNanchor_634">[634]</a>
And Dunlap quotes <cite>Psalm</cite> <abbr title="sixty-eight">lxviii.</abbr> 4, which reads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Praise him by his name Iach (יה),<a id="hebrew13"></a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who rides upon the heavens, as on a horse,”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">and then shows that “the Arabs represented Iauk (Iach) by a horse. The
Horse of the Sun
 <span class="lock">(Dionysus).”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_635" id="FNanchor_635">[635]</a></span>
 Iah is a softening of Iach, “he
explains.” ח <i>ch</i> and ה <i>h</i> interchange; so <i>s</i> softens to <i>h</i>. The Hebrews
express the idea of <span class="smcap">Life</span> both by a <i>ch</i> and an <i>h</i>; as chiach, to be, hiah,
to be; Iach, God of Life, Iah, “I
 <span class="lock"><i>am</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_636" id="FNanchor_636">[636]</a></span>
 Well then may we repeat
these lines of Ausonius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Ogugiâ calls me Bacchus; Egypt thinks me Osiris;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Musians name me Ph’anax; the Indi consider me Dionysus;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Roman Mysteries call me Liber; the Arabian race Adonis!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">And the chosen people Adoni and Jehovah—we may add.</p>

<p>How little the philosophy of the old secret doctrine was understood, is
illustrated in the atrocious persecutions of the Templars by the Church,
and in the accusation of their worshipping the Devil under the shape of
the goat—Baphomet! Without going into the old Masonic mysteries,
there is not a Mason—of those we mean who <em>do know something</em>—but
has an idea of the true relation that Baphomet bore to Azâzêl, the scapegoat
of the
 <span class="lock">wilderness,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_637" id="FNanchor_637">[637]</a></span>
 whose character and meaning are entirely perverted

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>

in the Christian translations. “This terrible and venerable name
of God,” says
 <span class="lock">Lanci,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_638" id="FNanchor_638">[638]</a></span>
 librarian to the Vatican, “through the pen of biblical
glossers, has been a <em>devil</em>, a mountain, a <em>wilderness</em>, and a <i>he-goat</i>.”
In Mackenzie’s <cite>Royal Masonic Cyclopædia</cite>, the author very correctly
remarks that “this word should be divided into Azaz and El,” for “it
signifies God of Victory, but is here used in the sense of <em>author of Death</em>,
in contrast to Jehovah, the <em>author of Life</em>; the latter received a dead
goat as an
 <span class="lock">offering.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_639" id="FNanchor_639">[639]</a></span>
 The Hindu Trinity is composed of three personages,
which are convertible into one. The <i>Trimurti</i> is one, and in its
abstraction indivisible, and yet we see a metaphysical division taking
place from the first, and while Brahma, though collectively representing
the three, remains behind the scenes, Vishnu is the Life-Giver, the Creator,
and the Preserver, and Siva is the <i>Destroyer</i>, and the <i>Death-giving</i>
deity. “Death to the <i>Life-Giver</i>, life to the <i>Death-dealer</i>. The symbolical
antithesis is grand and beautiful,” says
 <span class="lock">Gliddon.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_640" id="FNanchor_640">[640]</a></span>
 “<i lang="la">Deus est
Dæmon inversus</i>” of the kabalists now becomes clear. It is but the
intense and cruel desire to crush out the last vestige of the old philosophies
by perverting their meaning, for fear that their own dogmas should
not be rightly fathered on them, which impels the Catholic Church to
carry on such a systematic persecution in regard to Gnostics, Kabalists,
and even the comparatively innocent Masons.</p>

<p>Alas, alas! How little has the divine seed, scattered broadcast by
the hand of the meek Judean philosopher, thrived or brought forth fruit.
He, who himself had shunned hypocrisy, warned against public prayer,
showing such contempt for any useless exhibition of the same, could he
but cast his sorrowful glance on the earth, from the regions of eternal
bliss, would see that this seed fell neither on sterile rock nor by the
way-side. Nay, it took deep root in the most prolific soil; one enriched
even to plethora with lies and human gore!</p>

<p>“For, if the truth of God hath more abounded, <em>through my lie</em> unto
his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?” naïvely inquires Paul,
the best and sincerest of all the apostles. And he then adds: “<em>Let us do
evil</em>, that good may come!” (<cite>Romans</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 7, 8). This is a confession
which we are asked to believe as having been a direct inspiration from
God! It explains, if it does not excuse, the maxim adopted later by the
Church that “it is an act of virtue to deceive and lie, when by such
means the interests of <em>the Church</em> might be
 <span class="lock">promoted.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_641" id="FNanchor_641">[641]</a></span>
 A maxim

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>

applied in its fullest sense by that accomplished professor in forgery, the
Armenian Eusebius; or yet, that innocent-looking bible-kaleidoscopist—Irenæus.
And these men were followed by a whole army of pious
assassins, who, in the meanwhile, had improved upon the system of
deceit, by proclaiming that it was lawful even to kill, when by murder
they could enforce the new religion. Theophilus, “that perpetual
enemy of peace and virtue,” as the famous bishop was called; Cyril,
Athanasius, the murderer of Arius, and a host of other canonized
“Saints,” were all but too worthy successors of <em>Saint</em> Constantine, who
drowned his wife in boiling water; butchered his little nephew; murdered,
with his own pious hand, two of his brothers-in-law; killed his own son
Crispus, bled to death several men and women, and smothered in a well
an old monk. However, we are told by Eusebius that this Christian
Emperor was rewarded by a <em>vision</em> of Christ himself, bearing his cross,
who instructed him to march to other triumphs, inasmuch as he would
always protect him!</p>

<p>It is under the shade of the Imperial standard, with its famous sign,
“<i lang="la">In hoc signo vinces</i>,” that “<em>visionary</em>” Christianity, which had crept
on since the days of Irenæus, arrogantly proclaimed its rights in the full
blaze of the sun. The Labarum had most probably furnished the model
for the <em>true</em> cross, which was “miraculously,” and agreeably to the
Imperial will, found a few years later. Nothing short of such a remarkable
vision, impiously doubted by some severe critics—Dr. Lardner for
one—and a fresh miracle to match, could have resulted in the finding of
a cross where there had never before been one. Still, we have either to
believe the phenomenon or dispute it at the risk of being treated as infidels;
and this, notwithstanding that upon a careful computation we
would find that the fragments of the “true Cross” had multiplied themselves
even more miraculously than the five loaves in the invisible
bakery, and the two fishes. In all cases like this, where miracles can be
so conveniently called in, there is no room for dull fact. History must
step out that fiction may step in.</p>

<p>If the alleged founder of the Christian religion is now, after the
lapse of nineteen centuries, preached—more or less unsuccessfully however—in
every corner of the globe, we are at liberty to think that the
doctrines attributed to him would astonish and dismay him more than
any one else. A system of deliberate falsification was adopted from the
first. How determined Irenæus was to crush truth and build up a
Church of his own on the mangled remains of the seven primitive
churches mentioned in the <cite>Revelation</cite>, may be inferred from his quarrel
with Ptolemæus. And this is again a case of evidence against which no
blind faith can prevail. Ecclesiastical history assures us that Christ’s

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>

ministry was but of three years’ duration. There is a decided discrepancy
on this point between the first three synoptics and the fourth gospel;
but it was left for Irenæus to show to Christian posterity that so
early as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 180—the probable time when this Father wrote his works
against heresies—even such pillars of the Church as himself either knew
nothing certain about it, or deliberately lied and falsified dates to support
their own views. So anxious was the worthy Father to meet every
possible objection against his plans, that no falsehood, no sophistry, was
too much for him. How are we to understand the following; and who
is the falsifier in this case? The argument of Ptolemæus was that Jesus
was too young to have taught anything of much importance; adding
that “Christ preached for <em>one year only</em>, and then suffered in the twelfth
month.” In this Ptolemæus was very little at variance with the gospels.
But Irenæus, carried by his object far beyond the limits of prudence,
from a mere discrepancy between one and three years, makes it <em>ten</em> and
even twenty years! “Destroying his (Christ’s) whole work, and <em>robbing
him of that age</em> which is <em>both necessary</em> and more honorable than any
other; that more advanced age, I mean, during which also, as a teacher,
he excelled all others.” And then, having no certain data to furnish, he
throws himself back on <em>tradition</em>, and claims that Christ had preached
for over <span class="allsmcap">TEN</span> years! (book <abbr title="two, chapter">ii., c.</abbr> 22, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 4, 5). In another place he
makes Jesus fifty years old.</p>

<p>But we must proceed in our work of showing the various origins of
Christianity, as also the sources from which Jesus derived his own ideas
of God and humanity.</p>

<p>The Koinobi lived in Egypt, where Jesus passed his early youth. They
were usually confounded with the Therapeutæ, who were a branch of this
widely-spread society. Such is the opinion of Godfrey Higgins and De
Rebold. After the downfall of the principal sanctuaries, which had
already begun in the days of Plato, the many different sects, such as the
Gymnosophists and the Magi—from whom Clearchus very erroneously
derives the former—the Pythagoreans, the Sufis, and the Reshees of
Kashmere, instituted a kind of international and universal Freemasonry,
among their esoteric societies. “These Rashees,” says Higgins, “are
the Essenians, Carmelites, or Nazarites of the
 <span class="lock">temple.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_642" id="FNanchor_642">[642]</a></span>
 “That occult
science known by ancient priests under the name of <i>regenerating fire</i>,”
says father Rebold, “... a science that for more than 3,000 years was
the peculiar possession of the Indian and Egyptian priesthood, into the
knowledge of which Moses was initiated at Heliopolis, where he was
educated; and Jesus among the Essenian priests of Egypt or Judea;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>

and by which these two great reformers, <em>particularly the latter</em>, wrought
many of the miracles mentioned in the
 <span class="lock"><i>Scriptures</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_643" id="FNanchor_643">[643]</a></span></p>

<p>Plato states that the mystic Magian religion, known under the name
of <i>Machagistia</i>, is the most uncorrupted form of worship in things divine.
Later, the Mysteries of the Chaldean sanctuaries were added to it by one
of the Zoroasters and Darius Hystaspes. The latter completed and perfected
it still more with the help of the knowledge obtained by him from
the learned ascetics of India, whose rites were identical with those of the
initiated
 <span class="lock">Magi.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_644" id="FNanchor_644">[644]</a></span>
 Ammian, in his history of Julian’s Persian expedition,
gives the story by stating that one day Hystaspes, as he was boldly penetrating
into the unknown regions of Upper India, had come upon a certain
wooded solitude, the tranquil recesses of which were “occupied by those
exalted sages, the Brachmanes (or Shamans). Instructed by their teaching
in the science of <em>the motions of the</em> world and of the heavenly bodies, and
in <em>pure religious rites</em> ... he transfused them into the creed of the Magi.
The latter, coupling these doctrines with their <em>own peculiar science of
foretelling the future</em>, have handed down the whole through their descendants
to succeeding
 <span class="lock">ages.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_645" id="FNanchor_645">[645]</a></span>
 It is from these descendants that the Sufis,
chiefly composed of Persians and Syrians, acquired their proficient knowledge
in astrology, medicine, and the esoteric doctrine of the ages. “The
Sufi doctrine,” says C. W. King, “involved the grand idea of one universal
creed which could be secretly held under any profession of an outward
faith; and, in fact, took virtually the same view of religious systems
as that in which the ancient philosophers had regarded such
 <span class="lock">matters.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_646" id="FNanchor_646">[646]</a></span>
The mysterious Druzes of Mount Lebanon are the descendants of all
these. Solitary Copts, earnest students scattered hither and thither
throughout the sandy solitudes of Egypt, Arabia Petræa, Palestine, and
the impenetrable forests of Abyssinia, though rarely met with, may sometimes
be seen. Many and various are the nationalities to which belong
the disciples of that mysterious school, and many the side-shoots of that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>

one primitive stock. The secresy preserved by these sub-lodges, as well
as by the one and supreme great lodge, has ever been proportionate to
the activity of religious persecutions; and now, in the face of the growing
materialism, their very existence is becoming a
 <span class="lock">mystery.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_647" id="FNanchor_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p>But it must not be inferred, on that account, that such a mysterious
brotherhood is but a fiction, not even <em>a name</em>, though it remains unknown
to this day. Whether its affiliates are called by an Egyptian, Hindu, or
Persian name, it matters not. Persons belonging to one of these sub-brotherhoods
have been met by trustworthy, and not unknown persons,
besides the present writer, who states a few facts concerning them, by the
special permission of one <em>who has a right to give it</em>. In a recent and
very valuable work on secret societies, K. R. H. Mackenzie’s <cite>Royal
Masonic Cyclopædia</cite>, we find the learned author himself, an honorary
member of the Canongate Kilwinning Lodge, <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 (Scotland), and a
Mason not likely to be imposed upon, stating the following, under the
head, <cite>Hermetic Brothers of Egypt</cite>:</p>

<p>“An occult fraternity, which has endured from very ancient times,
having a hierarchy of officers, secret signs, and passwords, and a peculiar
method of instruction in science, religion, and philosophy.... If
we may believe those who, at the present time, profess to belong to it,
<em>the philosopher’s stone</em>, <em>the elixir of life</em>, <em>the art of invisibility</em>, and the
power of communication directly with the ultramundane life, are parts
of the inheritance they possess. The writer has met with only three persons
who maintained the actual existence of this body of religious philosophers,
and who hinted that they themselves were actually members.
There was no reason to doubt the good faith of these individuals—apparently
unknown to each other, and men of moderate competence,
blameless lives, austere manners, and almost ascetic in their habits.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>

They all appeared to be men of forty to forty-five years of age, and evidently
of vast erudition ... their knowledge of languages not to be
doubted.... They never remained long in any one country, but passed
away without creating
 <span class="lock">notice.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_648" id="FNanchor_648">[648]</a></span></p>

<p>Another of such sub-brotherhoods is the sect of the Pitris, in India.
Known by name, now that Jacolliot has brought it into public notice, it
yet is more arcane, perhaps, than the brotherhood that Mr. Mackenzie
names the “Hermetic Brothers.” What Jacolliot learned of it, was from
fragmentary manuscripts delivered to him by Brahmans, who had their
reasons for doing so, we must believe. The <cite>Agrouchada Parikshai</cite> gives
certain details about the association, as it was in days of old, and, when
explaining mystic rites and magical incantations, explains nothing at all,
so that the mystic L’om, L’Rhum, Sh’hrum, and Sho-rim Ramaya-Namaha,
remain, for the mystified writer, as much a puzzle as ever. To
do him justice, though, he fully admits the fact, and does not enter upon
useless speculations.</p>

<p>Whoever desires to assure himself that there now exists a religion
which has baffled, for centuries, the impudent inquisitiveness of missionaries,
and the persevering inquiry of science, let him violate, if he can,
the seclusion of the Syrian Druzes. He will find them numbering over
80,000 warriors, scattered from the plain east of Damascus to the western
coast. They covet no proselytes, shun notoriety, keep friendly—as far
as possible—with both Christians and Mahometans, respect the religion
of every other sect or people, but will never disclose their own secrets.
Vainly do the missionaries stigmatize them as infidels, idolaters, brigands,
and thieves. Neither threat, bribe, nor any other consideration will
induce a Druze to become a convert to dogmatic Christianity. We have
heard of two in fifty years, and both have finished their careers in prison,
for drunkenness and theft. They proved to be “real
 <span class="lock"><i>Druzes</i>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_649" id="FNanchor_649">[649]</a></span>
 said one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
of their chiefs, in discussing the subject. There never was a case of an
<em>initiated</em> Druze becoming a Christian. As to the uninitiated, they are
never allowed to even see the sacred writings, and none of them have
the remotest idea where these are kept. There are missionaries in
Syria who boast of having in their possession a few copies. The volumes
alleged to be the correct expositions from these secret books (such
as the translation by <span lang="fr">Petis de la Croix</span>, in 1701, from the works presented
by Nasr-Allah to the French king), are nothing more than a compilation
of “secrets,” known more or less to every inhabitant of the southern
ranges of Lebanon and Anti-Libanus. They were the work of an apostate
Dervish, who was expelled from the sect Hanafi, for improper conduct—the
embezzlement of the money of widows and orphans. The
<cite>Exposé de la Religion des Druzes</cite>, in two volumes, by Sylvestre de Sacy
(1828), is another net-work of hypotheses. A copy of this work was to
be found, in 1870, on the window-sill of one of their principal <i>Holowey</i>,
or place of religious meeting. To the inquisitive question of an English
traveller, as to their rites, the
 <span class="lock"><i>Okhal</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_650" id="FNanchor_650">[650]</a></span>
 a venerable old man, who spoke
English as well as French, opened the volume of de Sacy, and, offering
it to his interlocutor, remarked, with a benevolent smile: “Read this
instructive and truthful book; I could explain to you neither better nor
more correctly the secrets of God and our blessed Hamsa, than it does.”
The traveller understood the hint.</p>

<p>Mackenzie says they settled at Lebanon about the tenth century, and
“seem to be a mixture of Kurds, Mardi-Arabs, and other semi-civilized
tribes. Their religion is compounded of Judaism, Christianity, and Mahometanism.
They have a regular order of priesthood and <em>a kind of hierarchy</em>
... there is a regular system of passwords and signs.... Twelve
month’s probation, to which either sex is admitted, preceded initiation.”</p>

<p>We quote the above only to show how little even persons as trustworthy
as Mr. Mackenzie really know of these mystics.</p>

<p>Mosheim, who knows as much, or we should rather say as little, as any
others, is entitled to the merit of candidly admitting that “their religion
is peculiar to themselves, and is involved in some mystery.” We should
say it was—rather!</p>

<p>That their religion exhibits traces of Magianism and Gnosticism is
natural, as the whole of the Ophite esoteric philosophy is at the bottom
of it. But the characteristic dogma of the Druzes is the absolute unity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>

of God. He is the essence of life, and although incomprehensible and
invisible, is to be known through <em>occasional manifestations in human</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>form</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_651" id="FNanchor_651">[651]</a></span>
 Like the Hindus they hold that he was incarnated more than
once on earth. Hamsa was the <em>precursor</em> of the last manifestation to be
(the tenth
 <span class="lock"><i>avatar</i>)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_652" id="FNanchor_652">[652]</a></span>
 not the inheritor of Hakem, who is yet to come.
Hamsa was the personification of the “Universal Wisdom.” Boha-eddin
in his writings calls him Messiah. The whole number of his disciples,
or those who at different ages of the world have imparted wisdom
to mankind, which the latter as invariably have forgotten and rejected in
course of time, is one hundred and sixty-four (164, the kabalistic <i>s d k</i>).
Therefore, their stages or degrees of promotion after initiation are five;
the first three degrees are typified by the “three feet of the candlestick
of the inner Sanctuary, which holds the light of the <em>five</em> elements;” the
last two degrees, the most important and terrifying in their solemn
grandeur belonging to the highest orders; and the whole five degrees
emblematically represent the said five mystic Elements. The “three
feet are the holy <i>Application</i>, the <i>Opening</i>, and the <i>Phantom</i>,” says one
of their books; on man’s inner and outer soul, and his body, a phantom,
a passing shadow. The body, or matter, is also called the “Rival,” for
“he is the minister of sin, the Devil ever creating dissensions between the
Heavenly Intelligence (spirit) and the soul, which he tempts incessantly.”
Their ideas on transmigration are Pythagorean and kabalistic. The
spirit, or Temeami (the divine soul), was in Elijah and John the Baptist;
and the soul of Jesus was that of H’amsa; that is to say, of the same degree
of purity and sanctity. Until their resurrection, by which they understand
the day when the spiritual bodies of men will be absorbed into
God’s own essence and being (the Nirvana of the Hindus), the souls
of men will keep their astral forms, except the few chosen ones who,
from the moment of their separation from their bodies, begin to exist as
pure spirits. The life of man they divide into soul, body, and intelligence,
or mind. It is the latter which imparts and communicates to the
soul the divine spark from its H’amsa (Christos).</p>

<p>They have seven great commandments which are imparted equally
to all the uninitiated; and yet, even these well-known articles of faith
have been so mixed up in the accounts of outside writers, that, in one
of the best Cyclopædias of America (Appleton’s), they are garbled after
the fashion that may be seen in the comparative tabulation below; the
spurious and the true order parallel:</p>

<p>As will be seen, the only exposé in the above is that of the great
ignorance, perhaps malice, of the writers who, like Sylvestre de Sacy,
undertake to enlighten the world upon matters concerning which they
know nothing.</p>

<p>“Chastity, honesty, meekness, and mercy,” are thus the four theological
virtues of all Druzes, besides several others demanded from the
initiates: “murder, theft, cruelty, covetousness, slander,” the five sins, to
which several other sins are added in the sacred tablets, but which we
must abstain from giving. The morality of the Druzes is strict and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>
uncompromising. Nothing can tempt one of these Lebanon Unitarians
to go astray from what he is taught to consider his duty. <em>Their ritual
being unknown to outsiders</em>, their would-be historians have hitherto denied
them one. Their “Thursday meetings” are open to all, but no interloper
has ever participated in the rites of initiation which take place
occasionally on Fridays in the greatest secresy. Women are admitted
to them as well as men, and they play a part of great importance at the
initiation of men. The probation, unless some extraordinary exception
is made, is long and severe. Once, in a certain period of time, a solemn
ceremony takes place, during which all the elders and the initiates of
the highest two degrees start out for a pilgrimage of several days to a
certain place in the mountains. They meet within the safe precincts of
a monastery said to have been erected during the earliest times of the
Christian era. Outwardly one sees but old ruins of a once grand edifice,
used, says the legend, by some Gnostic sects as a place of worship during
the religious persecutions. The ruins above ground, however, are but
a convenient mask; the subterranean chapel, halls, and cells, covering
an area of ground far greater than the upper building; while the richness
of ornamentation, the beauty of the ancient sculptures, and the
gold and silver vessels in this sacred resort, appear like “a dream of
glory,” according to the expression of an initiate. As the lamaseries
of Mongolia and Thibet are visited upon grand occasions by the holy
shadow of “Lord Buddha,” so here, during the ceremonial, appears the
resplendent ethereal form of Hamsa, the Blessed, which instructs the
faithful. The most extraordinary feats of what would be termed magic
take place during the several nights that the convocation lasts; and one
of the greatest mysteries—faithful copy of the past—is accomplished
within the discreet bosom of our mother earth; not an echo, nor the
faintest sound, not a glimmer of light betrays without the grand secret
of the initiates.</p>

<p>Hamsa, like Jesus, was a mortal man, and yet “Hamsa” and “Christos”
are synonymous terms as to their inner and hidden meaning. Both
are symbols of the <i>Nous</i>, the divine and higher soul of man—his spirit.
The doctrine taught by the Druzes on that particular question of the
duality of spiritual man, consisting of one soul mortal, and another immortal,
is identical with that of the Gnostics, the older Greek philosophers,
and other initiates.</p>

<p>Outside the East we have met one initiate (and only one), who, for
some reasons best known to himself, does not make a secret of his initiation
into the Brotherhood of Lebanon. It is the learned traveller and
artist, Professor A. L. Rawson, of New York City. This gentleman has
passed many years in the East, four times visited Palestine, and has travelled

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>

to Mecca. It is safe to say that he has a priceless store of facts
about the beginnings of the Christian Church, which none but one who
had had free access to repositories closed against the ordinary traveller
could have collected. Professor Rawson, with the true devotion of a
man of science, noted down every important discovery he made in the
Palestinian libraries, and every precious fact orally communicated to him
by the mystics he encountered, and some day they will see the light. He
has most obligingly sent us the following communication, which, as the
reader will perceive, fully corroborates what is above written from our
personal experience about the strange fraternity incorrectly styled the
Druzes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right r1 smaller">
“<span class="smcap">34 Bond <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>, New York</span>, June 6, 1877.<br>
</p>

<p>“... Your note, asking me to give you an account of my initiation into a secret
order among the people commonly known as Druzes, in Mount Lebanon, was received
this morning. I took, as you are fully aware, an obligation at that time to conceal
within my own memory the greater part of the ‘mysteries,’ with the most interesting
parts of the ‘instructions;’ so that what is left may not be of any service to the public.
Such information as I can rightfully give, you are welcome to have and use as you may
have occasion.</p>

<p>“The probation in my case was, by <em>special dispensation</em>, made one month, during
which time I was ‘shadowed’ by a priest, who served as my cook, guide, interpreter, and
general servant, that he might be able to testify to the fact of my having strictly conformed
to the rules in diet, ablutions, and other matters. He was also my instructor in
the text of the ritual, which we recited from time to time for practice, in dialogue or in
song, as it may have been. Whenever we happened to be near a Druze village, on a
Thursday, we attended the ‘open’ meetings, where men and women assembled for
instruction and worship, and to expose to the world generally their religious practices.
I was never present at a Friday ‘close’ meeting before my initiation, nor do I believe
any one else, man or woman, ever was, except by collusion with a priest, and that is
not probable, for a false priest forfeits his life. The practical jokers among them sometimes
‘fool’ a too curious ‘Frank’ by a sham initiation, especially if such a one is suspected
of having some connection with the missionaries at Beirut or elsewhere.</p>

<p>“The initiates include both women and men, and the ceremonies are of so peculiar
a nature that both sexes are required to assist in the ritual and ‘work.’ The ‘furniture’
of the ‘prayer-house’ and of the ‘vision-chamber’ is simple, and except for convenience
may consist of but a strip of carpet. In the ‘Gray Hall’ (the place is never
named, and is underground, <em>not far</em> from Bayt-ed-Deen) there are some rich decorations
and valuable pieces of ancient furniture, the work of Arab silversmiths five or six
centuries ago, inscribed and dated. The day of initiation must be a continual fast from
daylight to sunset in winter, or six o’clock in summer, and the ceremony is from beginning
to end a series of trials and temptations, calculated to test the endurance of the
candidate under physical and mental pressure. It is seldom that any but the young man
or woman succeeds in ‘winning’ all the ‘prizes,’ since <em>nature will sometimes exert itself</em>
in spite of the most stubborn will, and the neophyte fail of passing some of the tests.
In such a case the probation is extended another year, when another trial is had.</p>

<p>“Among other tests of the neophyte’s self-control are the following: Choice pieces

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>

of cooked meat, savory soup, pilau, and other appetizing dishes, with sherbet, coffee,
wine, and water, are set, as if accidentally, in his way, and he is left alone for a time
with the tempting things. To a hungry and fainting soul the trial is severe. But a
more difficult ordeal is when the seven priestesses retire, all but one, the youngest and
prettiest, and the door is closed and barred on the outside, after warning the candidate
that he will be left to his ‘reflections,’ for half an hour. Wearied by the long-continued
ceremonial, weak with hunger, parched with thirst, and a sweet reaction coming after
the tremendous strain to keep his animal nature in subjection, this moment of privacy
and of temptation is brimful of peril. The beautiful young vestal, timidly approaching,
and with glances which lend a double magnetic allurement to her words, begs him in
low tones to ‘bless her.’ Woe to him if he does! A hundred eyes see him from secret
peep-holes, and only to the ignorant neophyte is there the appearance of concealment
and opportunity.</p>

<p>“There is no infidelity, idolatry, or other really bad feature in the system. They
have the relics of what was once a grand form of nature-worship, which has been contracted
under a despotism into a secret order, hidden from the light of day, and exposed
only in the smoky glare of a few burning lamps, in some damp cave or chapel under
ground. The chief tenets of their religious teachings are comprised in seven ‘tablets,’
which are these, to state them in general terms:</p>

<p>“1. The unity of God, or the infinite oneness of deity.</p>

<p>“2. The essential excellence of truth.</p>

<p>“3. The law of toleration as to all men and women in opinion.</p>

<p>“4. Respect for all men and women as to character and conduct.</p>

<p>“5. Entire submission to God’s decrees as to fate.</p>

<p>“6. Chastity of body and mind and soul.</p>

<p>“7. Mutual help under all conditions.</p>

<p>“These tenets are not printed or written. Another set is printed or written to
mislead the unwary, but with these we are not concerned.</p>

<p>“The chief results of the initiation seemed to be a kind of mental illusion or sleep-waking,
in which the neophyte saw, or thought he saw, the images of people who were
known to be absent, and in some cases thousands of miles away. I thought (or perhaps
it was my mind at work) I saw friends and relatives that I knew at the time were
in New York State, while I was then in Lebanon. How these results were produced I
cannot say. They appeared in a dark room, when the ‘guide’ was talking, the ‘company’
singing in the next ‘chamber,’ and near the close of the day, when I was tired
out with fasting, walking, talking, singing, robing, unrobing, seeing a great many people
in various conditions as to dress and undress, and with great mental strain in resisting
certain physical manifestations that result from the appetites when they overcome the
will, and in paying close attention to the passing scenes, hoping to remember them—so
that I may have been unfit to judge of any new and surprising phenomena, and more
especially of those apparently magical appearances which have always excited my suspicion
and distrust. I know the various uses of the magic-lantern, and other apparatus,
and took care to examine the room where the ‘visions’ appeared to me the same evening,
and the next day, and several times afterwards, and knew that, in my case, there
was no use made of any machinery or other means besides the voice of the ‘guide and
instructor.’ On several occasions afterward, when at a great distance from the ‘chamber,’
the same or similar visions were produced, as, for instance, in Hornstein’s Hotel at
Jerusalem. A daughter-in-law of a well-known Jewish merchant in Jerusalem is an
initiated ‘sister,’ and can produce the visions almost at will on any one who will live

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>

strictly according to the rules of the Order for a few weeks, more or less, according to
their nature, as gross or refined, etc.</p>

<p>“I am quite safe in saying that the initiation is so peculiar that it could not be
printed so as to instruct one who had not been ‘worked’ through the ‘chamber.’ So
it would be even more impossible to make an exposé of them than of the Freemasons.
The real secrets are acted and not spoken, and require several initiated persons to assist
in the work.</p>

<p>“It is not necessary for me to say how some of the notions of that people seem to
perpetuate certain beliefs of the ancient Greeks—as, for instance, the idea that a man
has two souls, and many others—for you probably were made familiar with them in
your passage through the ‘upper’ and ‘lower chamber.’ If I am mistaken in supposing
you an ‘initiate,’ please excuse me. I am aware that the closest friends often
conceal that ‘sacred secret’ from each other; and even husband and wife may live—as
I was informed in Dayr-el-Kamar was the fact in one family there—for twenty years
together and yet neither know anything of the initiation of the other. You, undoubtedly,
have good reasons for keeping your own counsel.</p>

</div>

<p>Before we close the subject we may add that if a stranger ask for
admission to a “Thursday” meeting he will never be refused. Only, if
he is a Christian, the <i>okhal</i> will open a <cite>Bible</cite> and read from it; and if a
Mahometan, he will hear a few chapters of the <cite>Koran</cite>, and the ceremony
will end with this. They will wait until he is gone, and then, shutting
well the doors of their convent, take to their own rites and books, passing
for this purpose into their subterranean sanctuaries. “The Druzes
remain, even more than the Jews, a peculiar people,” says Colonel
 <span class="lock">Churchill,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_658" id="FNanchor_658">[658]</a></span>
 one of the few fair and strictly impartial writers. “They marry
within their own race; they are rarely if ever converted; they adhere
tenaciously to their traditions, and they baffle all efforts to discover their
cherished secrets.... The bad name of that caliph whom they claim
as their founder is fairly compensated by the pure lives of many whom
they honor as saints, and by the heroism of their feudal leaders.”</p>

<p>And yet the Druzes may be said to belong to one of the least esoteric
of secret societies. There are others far more powerful and learned, the
existence of which is not even suspected in Europe. There are many
branches belonging to the great “Mother Lodge” which, mixed up with
certain communities, may be termed secret sects within other sects. One
of them is the sect commonly known as that of Laghana-Sastra. It reckons
several thousand adepts who are scattered about in small groups in
the south of the Dekkan, India. In the popular superstition, this sect is
dreaded on account of its great reputation for magic and sorcery. The
Brahmans accuse its members of atheism and sacrilege, for none of them

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>

will consent to recognize the authority of either the <cite>Vedas</cite> or <cite>Manu</cite>, except
so far as they conform to the versions in their possession, and which
they maintain are professedly the only original texts; the Laghana-Sastra
have neither temples nor priests, but, twice a month, every member of
the community has to absent himself from home for three days. Popular
rumor, originated among their women, ascribes such absences to pilgrimages
performed to their places of fortnightly resort. In some secluded
mountainous spots, unknown and inaccessible to other sects, hidden far
from sight among the luxurious vegetation of India, they keep their bungalows,
which look like small fortresses, encircled as they are by lofty
and thick walls. These, in their turn, are surrounded by the sacred trees
called <i>assonata</i>, and in Tamül <i>arassa maram</i>. These are the “sacred
groves,” the originals of those of Egypt and Greece, whose initiates also
built their temples within such “groves” inaccessible to the
 <span class="lock">profane.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_659" id="FNanchor_659">[659]</a></span></p>

<p>It will not be found without interest to see what Mr. John Yarker, <abbr title="Junior">Jr.</abbr>,
has to say on some modern secret societies among the Orientals. “The
nearest resemblance to the Brahmanical Mysteries, is probably found in
the very ancient ‘<i>Paths</i>’ of the Dervishes, which are usually governed
by twelve officers, the oldest ‘Court’ superintending the others by right
of seniority. Here the master of the ‘Court’ is called ‘<i>Sheik</i>,’ and
has his deputies, ‘Caliphs,’ or successors, of which there may be many
(as, for instance, in the brevet degree of a Master Mason). The order is
divided into at least four columns, pillars, or degrees. The first step is
that of ‘Humanity,’ which supposes attention to the written law, and
‘annihilation in the <i>Sheik</i>.’ The second is that of the ‘Path,’ in
which the ‘<i>Murid</i>,’ or disciple, attains spiritual powers and ‘self-annihilation’
into the ‘Peer’ or founder of the ‘Path.’ The third stage is
called ‘Knowledge,’ and the ‘<i>Murid</i>’ is supposed to become inspired,
called ‘annihilation into the Prophet.’ The fourth stage leads him even
to God, when he becomes a part of the Deity and sees Him in all things.
The first and second stages have received modern subdivisions, as
‘Integrity,’ ‘Virtue,’ ‘Temperance,’ ‘Benevolence.’ After this the
Sheik confers upon him the grade of ‘Caliph,’ or Honorary Master, for
in their mystical language, ‘the man must die before the saint can be
born.’ It will be seen that this kind of mysticism is applicable to Christ
as founder of a ‘Path.’”</p>

<p>To this statement, the author adds the following on the Bektash Dervishes,
who “often initiated the Janizaries. They wear <em>a small marble
cube spotted with blood</em>. Their ceremony is as follows: Before reception
a year’s probation is required, during which false secrets are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>

given to test the candidate; he has two godfathers <em>and is divested of all
metals and even clothing</em>; from the wool of a sheep a cord is made for
his neck, and a girdle for his loins; he is led into the centre of a square
room, presented as a slave, and seated upon a large stone with twelve
escallops; his arms are crossed upon his breast, his body inclined forward,
his right toes extended over his left foot; after various prayers he
is placed in a particular manner, with his hand in a peculiar way in that
of the Sheik, who repeats a verse from the <cite>Koran</cite>: ‘Those who on
giving thee their hand swear to thee an oath, swear it to God, the hand
of God is placed in their hand; whoever violates this oath, will do so to
his hurt, and to whoever remains faithful God will give a magnificent
reward.’ Placing the hand below the chin is their sign, perhaps in
memory of their vow. All use the double triangles. The Brahmans
inscribe the angles with their trinity, and they possess also the Masonic
sign of distress as used in
 <span class="lock">France.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_660" id="FNanchor_660">[660]</a></span></p>

<p>From the very day when the first mystic found the means of communication
between this world and the worlds of the invisible host, between
the sphere of matter and that of pure spirit, he concluded that to
abandon this mysterious science to the profanation of the rabble was to
lose it. An abuse of it might lead mankind to speedy destruction; it
was like surrounding a group of children with explosive batteries, and
furnishing them with matches. The first self-made adept initiated but a
select few, and kept silence with the multitudes. He recognized his God
and felt the great Being within himself. The “Âtman,” the
 <span class="lock">Self,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_661" id="FNanchor_661">[661]</a></span>
 the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>

mighty Lord and Protector, once that man knew him as the “<i>I am</i>,” the
“<i>Ego Sum</i>” the “<i>Ahmi</i>,” showed his full power to him who could recognize
the “<cite>still small voice</cite>.” From the days of the primitive man described
by the first Vedic poet, down to our modern age, there has not
been a philosopher worthy of that name, who did not carry in the silent
sanctuary of his heart the grand and mysterious truth. If initiated, he
learnt it as a sacred science; if otherwise, then, like Socrates repeating to
himself, as well as to his fellow-men, the noble injunction, “O man, know
thyself,” he succeeded in recognizing his God within himself. “Ye are
gods,” the king-psalmist tells us, and we find Jesus reminding the scribes
that the expression, “Ye are gods,” was addressed to other mortal men,
claiming for himself the same privilege without any
 <span class="lock">blasphemy.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_662" id="FNanchor_662">[662]</a></span>
 And, as
a faithful echo, Paul, while asserting that we are all “the temple of the
living
 <span class="lock">God,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_663" id="FNanchor_663">[663]</a></span>
 cautiously adds, that after all these things are only for the
“wise,” and it is “unlawful” to speak of them.</p>

<p>Therefore, we must accept the reminder, and simply remark that
even in the tortured and barbarous phraseology of the <cite>Codex Nazaræus</cite>,
we detect throughout the same idea. Like an undercurrent, rapid and
clear, it runs without mixing its crystalline purity with the muddy and
heavy waves of dogmatism. We find it in the <cite>Codex</cite>, as well as in the
<cite>Vedas</cite>, in the <cite>Avesta</cite>, as in the <cite>Abhidharma</cite>, and in <cite>Kapila’s Sânkhya
Sûtras</cite> not less than in the <cite>Fourth Gospel</cite>. We cannot attain the
“Kingdom of Heaven,” unless we unite ourselves indissolubly with our
<i lang="la">Rex Lucis</i>, the Lord of Splendor and of Light, our Immortal God. We
must first conquer immortality and “take the Kingdom of Heaven by
violence,” offered to our material selves. “The first man is of the earth
earthy; the <em>second</em> man <em>is from heaven</em>.... Behold, I show you a <i>mystery</i>,”
says Paul (<cite>1 Corinthians</cite>, <abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 47). In the religion of Sakya-Mum,
which learned commentators have delighted so much of late to set
down as purely <em>nihilistic</em>, the doctrine of immortality is very clearly defined,
notwithstanding the European or rather Christian ideas about
Nirvana. In the sacred Jaïna books, of Patuna, the dying Gautama-Buddha

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>

is thus addressed: “Arise into <i>Nirvi</i> (Nirvana) from this decrepit
body into which thou hast been sent. Ascend into <em>thy former
abode</em>, O blessed Avatar!” This seems to us the very opposite of Nihilism.
If Gautama is invited to reäscend into his “former abode,” and
this abode is Nirvana, then it is incontestable that Buddhistic philosophy
does <em>not</em> teach final annihilation. As Jesus is alleged to have appeared
to his disciples after death, so to the present day is Gautama believed
to descend from Nirvana. And if he has an existence there, then this
state cannot be a synonym for <i>annihilation</i>.</p>

<p>Gautama, no less than all other great reformers, had a doctrine for
his “elect” and another for the outside masses, though the main object
of his reform consisted in initiating all, so far as it was permissible and
prudent to do, without distinction of castes or wealth, to the great truths
hitherto kept so secret by the selfish Brahmanical class. Gautama-Buddha
it was whom we see the first in the world’s history, moved by
that generous feeling which locks the whole humanity within one embrace,
inviting the “poor,” the “lame,” and the “blind” to the King’s
festival table, from which he excluded those who had hitherto sat alone,
in haughty seclusion. It was he, who, with a bold hand, first opened
the door of the sanctuary to the pariah, the fallen one, and all those
“afflicted by men” clothed in gold and purple, often far less worthy
than the outcast to whom their finger was scornfully pointing. All this
did Siddhârtha six centuries before another reformer, as noble and as loving,
though less favored by opportunity, in another land. If both,
aware of the great danger of furnishing an uncultivated populace with the
double-edged weapon of <em>knowledge which gives power</em>, left the innermost
corner of the sanctuary in the profoundest shade, who, that is acquainted
with human nature, can blame them for it? But while one was actuated
by prudence, the other was forced into such a course. Gautama left
the esoteric and most dangerous portion of the “secret knowledge” untouched,
and lived to the ripe old age of eighty, with the certainty of having
taught the essential truths, and having converted to them one-third
of the world; Jesus promised his disciples the knowledge which confers
upon man the power <em>of producing far greater miracles than he ever did
himself</em>, and he died, leaving but a few faithful men, only half way to
knowledge, to struggle with the world to which they could impart but
what they <em>half</em>-knew themselves. Later, their followers disfigured truth
still more than they themselves had done.</p>

<p>It is not true that Gautama never taught anything concerning a
future life, or that he denied the immortality of the soul. Ask any intelligent
Buddhist his ideas on Nirvana, and he will unquestionably express
himself, as the well-known Wong-Chin-Fu, the Chinese orator, now

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>

travelling in this country, did in a recent conversation with us about
<i>Niepang</i> (Nirvana). “This condition,” he remarked, “we all understand
to mean a final reünion with God, coïncident with the perfection of
the human spirit by its ultimate disembarrassment of matter. It is the
very opposite of personal annihilation.”</p>

<p>Nirvana means the certitude of personal immortality in <em>Spirit</em>, not in
<em>Soul</em>, which, as a finite emanation, must certainly disintegrate its particles
a compound of human sensations, passions, and yearning for some objective
kind of existence, before the immortal spirit of the <em>Ego</em> is quite
freed, and henceforth secure against further transmigration in any form.
And how can man ever reach this state so long as the <i>Upadāna</i>, that
state of longing for <i>life</i>, more life, does not disappear from the sentient
being, from the <i>Ahancara</i> clothed, however, in a sublimated body? It is
the “Upādana” or the intense desire which produces WILL, and it is
<em>will</em> which develops <em>force</em>, and the latter generates <em>matter</em>, or an object
having form. Thus the disembodied <i>Ego</i>, through this sole undying desire
in him, unconsciously furnishes the conditions of his successive self-procreations
in various forms, which depend on his mental state and
<i>Karma</i>, the good or bad deeds of his preceding existence, commonly
called “merit and demerit.” This is why the “Master” recommended
to his mendicants the cultivation of the four degrees of Dhȳana, the noble
“Path of the Four Truths,” <i>i.e.</i>, that gradual acquirement of stoical indifference
for either life or death; that state of spiritual self-contemplation
during which man utterly loses sight of his physical and dual individuality,
composed of soul and body; and uniting himself with his third
and higher immortal self the <em>real and heavenly man</em> merges, so to say, into
the divine Essence, whence his own spirit proceeded like a spark from the
common hearth. Thus the Arhat, the holy mendicant, can reach Nirvana
while yet on earth; and his spirit, totally freed from the trammels of the
“psychical, terrestrial, <em>devilish</em> wisdom,” as James calls it, and being in its
own nature omniscient and omnipotent, can on earth, through the sole
power of his <em>thought</em>, produce the greatest of phenomena.</p>

<p>“It is the missionaries in China and India, who first started this falsehood
about Niepang, or Nïepana (Nirvana),” says Wong-Chin-Fu. Who
can deny the truth of this accusation after reading the works of the Abbé
Dubois, for instance? A missionary who passes forty years of his life in
India, and then writes that the “Buddhists admit of no other God but
the body of man, and have no other object but the satisfaction of their
senses,” utters an untruth which can be proved on the testimony of the
laws of the Talapoins of Siam and Birmah; laws, which prevail unto
this very day and which sentence a sahân, or <i>punghi</i> (a learned man;
from the Sanscrit <i>pundit</i>), as well as a simple Talapoin, to death by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>

decapitation, for the crime of unchastity. No foreigner can be admitted
into their <i>Kyums</i>, or Viharas (monasteries); and yet there are French
writers, otherwise impartial and fair, who, speaking of the great severity
of the rules to which the Buddhist monks are subjected in these communities,
and without possessing one single fact to corroborate their skepticism,
bluntly say, that “notwithstanding the great laudations bestowed
upon them (Talapoins) by certain travellers, merely on the <em>strength of
appearances</em>, I do not believe at all in their
 <span class="lock">chastity.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_664" id="FNanchor_664">[664]</a></span></p>

<p>Fortunately for the Buddhist talapoins, lamas, sahâns,
 <span class="lock">upasampadas,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_665" id="FNanchor_665">[665]</a></span>
and even
 <span class="lock">samenaïras,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_666" id="FNanchor_666">[666]</a></span>
 they have popular records and facts for themselves,
which are weightier than the unsupported personal opinion of
a Frenchman, born in Catholic lands, whom we can hardly blame for
having lost all faith in clerical virtue. When a Buddhist monk becomes
guilty (which does not happen once in a century, perhaps) of criminal
conversation, he has neither a congregation of tender-hearted members,
whom he can move to tears by an eloquent confession of his guilt, nor
a Jesus, on whose overburdened, long-suffering bosom are flung, as in a
common Christian dust-box, all the impurities of the race. No Buddhist
transgressor can comfort himself with visions of a Vatican, within whose
sin-encompassing walls black is turned into white, murderers into sinless
saints, and golden or silvery lotions can be bought at the confessional to
cleanse the tardy penitent of greater or lesser offenses against God and
man.</p>

<p>Except a few impartial archæologists, who trace a direct Buddhistic
element in Gnosticism, as in all those early short-lived sects we know
of very few authors, who, in writing upon primitive Christianity, have
accorded to the question its due importance. Have we not facts enough
to, at least, suggest some interest in that direction? Do we not learn
that, as early as in the days of Plato, there were “Brachmans”—read
Buddhist, Samaneans, Saman, or Shaman missionaries—in Greece, and
that, at one time, they had overflowed the country? Does not Pliny
show them established on the shores of the Dead Sea, for “thousands of
ages?” After making every necessary allowance for the exaggeration, we
still have several centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> left as a margin. And is it possible that
their influence should not have left deeper traces in all these sects than
is generally thought? We know that the Jaïna sect claims Buddhism
as derived from its tenets—that Buddhism existed before Siddhârtha,
better known as Gautama-Buddha. The Hindu Brahmans who, by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>

the European Orientalists, are denied the right of knowing anything about
their own country, or understanding their own language and records better
than those who have never been in India, on the same principle as the
Jews are forbidden, by the Christian theologians, to interpret their own
Scriptures—the Brahmans, we say, have authentic records. And these
show the incarnation from the Virgin Avany of the first Buddha—<em>divine
light</em>—as having taken place more than some thousands of years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
on the island of Ceylon. The Brahmans reject the claim that it was an
avatar of Vishnu, but admit the appearance of a reformer of Brahmanism
at that time. The story of the Virgin Avany and her divine son, Sâkya-muni,
is recorded in one of the sacred books of the Cinghalese Buddhists—the
<i>Nirdhasa</i>; and the Brahmanic chronology fixes the great
Buddhistic revolution and religious war, and the subsequent spread of
Sâkya-muni’s doctrine in Thibet, China, Japan, and other places at 4,620
years
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_667" id="FNanchor_667">[667]</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear that Gautama-Buddha, the son of the King of Kapilavastu,
and the descendant of the first Sakya, through his father, who was of the
Kshatriya, or warrior-caste, did not invent his philosophy. Philanthropist
by nature, his ideas were developed and matured while under the tuition
of Tir-thankara, the famous guru of the Jaïna sect. The latter claim
the present Buddhism as a diverging branch of their own philosophy, and
themselves, as the only followers of the first Buddha who were allowed
to remain in India, after the expulsion of all other Buddhists, probably
because they had made a compromise, and admitted some of the Brahmanic
notions. It is, to say the least, curious, that three dissenting and
inimical religions, like Brahmanism, Buddhism, and Jaïnism, should agree
so perfectly in their traditions and chronology, as to Buddhism, and that
our scientists should give a hearing but to their own unwarranted speculations
and hypotheses. If the birth of Gautama may, with some show
of reason, be placed at about 600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, then the preceding Buddhas
ought to have some place allowed them in chronology. The Buddhas are
not gods, but simply individuals overshadowed by the spirit of Buddha—the
divine ray. Or is it because, unable to extricate themselves from
the difficulty by the help of their own researches only, our Orientalists prefer
to obliterate and deny the whole, rather than accord to the Hindus the
right of knowing something of their own religion and history? Strange
way of discovering truths!</p>

<p>The common argument adduced against the Jaïna claim, of having been
the source of the restoration of ancient Buddhism, that the principal

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>

tenet of the latter religion is opposed to the belief of the Jaïnas, is not a
sound one. Buddhists, say our Orientalists, deny the existence of a
Supreme Being; the Jaïnas admit one, but protest against the assumption
that the “He” can ever interfere in the regulation of the universe.
We have shown in the preceding chapter that the Buddhists do not deny
any such thing. But if any disinterested scholar could study carefully the
Jaïna literature, in their thousands of books preserved—or shall we say
hidden—in Rajpootana, Jusselmere, at Patun, and other
 <span class="lock">places;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_668" id="FNanchor_668">[668]</a></span>
 and especially
if he could but gain access to the oldest of their sacred volumes,
he would find a perfect identity of philosophical thought, if not of popular
rites, between the Jaïnas and the Buddhists. The Adi-Buddha and
Adinâtha (or Adiswara) are identical in essence and purpose. And
now, if we trace the Jaïnas back, with their claims to the ownership of
the oldest cave-temples (those superb specimens of Indian architecture
and sculpture), and their records of an almost incredible antiquity, we
can hardly refuse to view them in the light which they claim for themselves.
We must admit, that in all probability they are the only true descendants
of the primitive owners of old India, dispossessed by those
conquering and mysterious hordes of white-skinned Brahmans whom, in the
twilight of history, we see appearing at the first as wanderers in the valleys
of Jumna and Ganges. The books of the Srawacs—the only descendants
of the Arhâtas or earliest Jaïnas, the naked forest-hermits of
the days of old, might throw some light, perhaps, on many a puzzling
question. But will our European scholars, so long as they pursue their
own policy, ever have access to the <em>right</em> volumes? We have our doubts
about this. Ask any trustworthy Hindu how the missionaries have dealt
with those manuscripts which unluckily fell into their hands, and then see
if we can blame the natives for trying to save from desecration the “gods
of their fathers.”</p>

<p>To maintain their ground Irenæus and his school had to fight hard with
the Gnostics. Such, also, was the lot of Eusebius, who found himself hopelessly
perplexed to know how the Essenes should be disposed of. The
ways and customs of Jesus and his apostles exhibited too close a resemblance
to this sect to allow the fact to pass unexplained. Eusebius tried
to make people believe that the Essenes were the first Christians. His
efforts were thwarted by Philo Judæus, who wrote his historical account
of the Essenes and described them with the minutest care, long before
there had appeared a single Christian in Palestine. But, if there
were no <em>Christians</em>, there were Chr<em>e</em>stians long before the era of Christianity;
and the Essenes belonged to the latter as well as to all other initiated

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>

brotherhoods, without even mentioning the Christnites of India. Lepsius
shows that the word <i>Nofre</i> means Chrēstos, “good,” and that one of
the titles of Osiris, “Onnofre,” must be translated “the goodness of
God made
 <span class="lock">manifest.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_669" id="FNanchor_669">[669]</a></span>
 “The worship of Christ was not universal at
this early date,” explains Mackenzie, “by which I mean that Christolatry
had not been introduced; but the worship of <i>Chrēstos</i>—the Good
Principle—had preceded it by many centuries, and even survived the
general adoption of Christianity, as shown on monuments still in existence.” ...
Again, we have an inscription which is pre-Christian on an
epitaphial tablet (Spon. <abbr title="Miscellanea eruditae antiquitatis"><cite>Misc. Erud.</cite>, Ant.</abbr>, <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr>
 <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 2). <a id="Greekch6"></a><span lang="el">Υακινθε Λαρισαιων Δημοσιε Ηρως Χρηστε Χαιρε</span>, and de Rossi (<cite>Roma Sotteranea</cite>, tome <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, tav.
<abbr title="twenty-one">xxi.</abbr>) gives us another example from the catacombs—“Ælia Chreste, in
 <span class="lock">Pace.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_670" id="FNanchor_670">[670]</a></span>
 And, <i>Kris</i>, as Jacolliot shows, means in Sanscrit “sacred.”</p>

<p>The meritorious stratagems of the trustworthy Eusebius thus proved
lost labor. He was triumphantly detected by Basnage, who, says Gibbon,
“examined with the utmost critical accuracy the curious treatise of Philo,
which describes the Therapeutæ,” and found that “by proving it was composed
as early as the time of Augustus, he has demonstrated, in spite of
Eusebius and a crowd of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutæ were
neither Christians nor monks.”</p>

<p>As a last word, the <em>Christian</em> Gnostics sprang into existence toward
the beginning of the second century, and just at the time when the Essenes
most mysteriously faded away, which indicated that they were the identical
Essenes, and moreover pure <i>Christists</i>, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: they believed and were
those who best understood what one of their own brethren had preached.
In insisting that the letter Iota, mentioned by Jesus in <cite>Matthew</cite> (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 18),
indicated a secret doctrine in relation to the ten æons, it is sufficient to
demonstrate to a kabalist that Jesus belonged to the Freemasonry of
those days; for Ι, which is Iota in Greek, has other names in other languages;
and is, as it was among the Gnostics of those days, a pass-word,
meaning the <span class="smcap">Sceptre</span> of the <span class="smcap">Father</span>, in Eastern brotherhoods which exist
to this very day.</p>

<p>But in the early centuries these facts, if known, were purposely
ignored, and not only withheld from public notice as much as possible,
but vehemently denied whenever the question was forced upon discussion.
The denunciations of the Fathers were rendered bitter in proportion to
the truth of the claim which they endeavored to refute.</p>

<p>“It comes to this,” writes Irenæus, complaining of the Gnostics,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>

“they neither consent to Scripture nor
 <span class="lock">tradition.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_671" id="FNanchor_671">[671]</a></span>
 And why should we
wonder at that, when even the commentators of the nineteenth century,
with nothing but fragments of the Gnostic manuscripts to compare with
the voluminous writings of their calumniators, have been enabled to detect
fraud on nearly every page? How much more must the polished and
learned Gnostics, with all their advantages of personal observation and
knowledge of fact, have realized the stupendous scheme of fraud that was
being consummated before their very eyes! Why should they accuse
Celsus of maintaining that their religion was all based on the speculations
of Plato, with the difference that his doctrines were far more pure and
rational than theirs, when we find Sprengel, seventeen centuries later,
writing the following?—“Not only did they (the Christians) think to discover
the dogmas of Plato in the books of Moses, but, moreover, they
fancied that, by introducing Platonism into Christianity, they would <em>elevate
the dignity of this religion and make it more popular among the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>nations</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_672" id="FNanchor_672">[672]</a></span></p>

<p>They introduced it so well, that not only was the Platonic philosophy
selected as a basis for the trinity, but even the legends and mythical
stories which had been current among the admirers of the great philosopher—as
a time-honored custom required in the eyes of his posterity
such an allegorical homage to every hero worthy of deification—were
revamped and used by the Christians. Without going so far as India, did
they not have a ready model for the “miraculous conception,” in the
legend about Periktionè, Plato’s mother? In her case it was also
maintained by popular tradition that she had immaculately conceived
him, and that the god Apollo was his father. Even the annunciation by
an angel to Joseph “in a dream,” the Christians copied from the message
of Apollo to Ariston, Periktionè’s husband, that the child to be born from
her was the offspring of that god. So, too, Romulus was said to be the
son of Mars, by the virgin Rhea Sylvia.</p>

<p>It is generally held by all the symbolical writers that the Ophites
were found guilty of practicing the most licentious rites during their
religious meetings. The same accusation was brought against the
Manichæans, the Carpocratians, the Paulicians, the Albigenses—in short,
against every Gnostic sect which had the temerity to claim the right to
think for itself. In our modern days, the 160 American sects and the 125
sects of England are not so often troubled with such accusations; times
are changed, and even the once all-powerful clergy have to either bridle
their tongues or prove their slanderous accusations.</p>

<p>We have carefully looked over the works of such authors as Payne

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>

Knight, C. W. King, and Olshausen, which treat of our subject; we have
reviewed the bulky volumes of Irenæus, Tertullian, Sozomen, Theodoret;
and in none but those of Epiphanius have we found any accusation based
upon direct evidence of an eye-witness. “They say;” “<em>Some</em> say;”
“We have heard”—such are the general and indefinite terms used by
the patristic accusers. Alone Epiphanius, whose works are invariably
referred to in all such cases, seems to chuckle with delight whenever he
couches a lance. We do not mean to take upon ourselves to defend the
sects which inundated Europe at the eleventh century, and which brought
to light the most wonderful creeds; we limit our defense merely to those
Christian sects whose theories were usually grouped under the generic
name of <i>Gnosticism</i>. These are those which appeared immediately after
the alleged crucifixion, and lasted till they were nearly exterminated
under the rigorous execution of the Constantinian law. The greatest
guilt of these were their syncretistic views, for at no other period of the
world’s history had truth a poorer prospect of triumph than in those days
of forgery, lying, and deliberate falsification of facts.</p>

<p>But before we are forced to believe the accusations, may we not be
permitted to inquire into the historical characters of their accusers? Let
us begin by asking, upon what ground does the Church of Rome build
her claim of supremacy for her doctrines over those of the Gnostics?
Apostolic succession, undoubtedly. The succession <em>traditionally</em> instituted
by the direct Apostle Peter. But what if this prove a fiction?
Clearly, the whole superstructure supported upon this one imaginary stilt
would fall in a tremendous crash. And when we do inquire carefully, we
find that we must take the word of Irenæus <em>alone</em> for it—of Irenæus, who
did not furnish one single valid proof of the claim which he so audaciously
advanced, and who resorted for that to endless forgeries. He gives
authority neither for his dates nor his assertions. This Smyrniote worthy
has not even the brutal but sincere faith of Tertullian, for he contradicts
himself at every step, and supports his claims solely on acute sophistry.
Though he was undoubtedly a man of the shrewdest intellect and great
learning, he fears not, in some of his assertions and arguments, to even
appear an idiot in the eyes of posterity, so long as he can “carry the situation.”
Twitted and cornered at every step by his not less acute and
learned adversaries, the Gnostics, he boldly shields himself behind blind
faith, and in answer to their merciless logic falls upon imaginary tradition
invented by himself. Reber wittily remarks: “As we read his misapplications
of words and sentences, we would conclude that he was a
lunatic if we did not know that he was something
 <span class="lock">else.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_673" id="FNanchor_673">[673]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>

So boldly mendacious does this “holy Father” prove himself in many
instances, that he is even contradicted by Eusebius, more cautious if not
more truthful than himself. He is driven to that necessity in the face of
unimpeachable evidence. So, for instance, Irenæus asserts that Papias,
Bishop of Hierapolis, was a direct hearer of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
 <span class="lock">John;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_674" id="FNanchor_674">[674]</a></span>
 and Eusebius
is compelled to show that Papias never pretended to such a claim, but
simply stated that he had received his <em>doctrine from those who had known</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>John</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_675" id="FNanchor_675">[675]</a></span></p>

<p>In one point, the Gnostics had the best of Irenæus. They drove him,
through mere fear of inconsistency, to the recognition of their kabalistic
doctrine of atonement; unable to grasp it in its allegorical meaning,
Irenæus presented, with Christian theology as we find it in its present
state of “original sin <em>versus</em> Adam,” a doctrine which would have filled
Peter with pious horror if he had been still alive.</p>

<p>The next champion for the propagation of Apostolic Succession, is
Eusebius himself. Is the word of this Armenian Father any better than
that of Irenæus? Let us see what the most competent critics say of
him. And before we turn to modern critics at all, we might remind the
reader of the scurrilous terms in which Eusebius is attacked by George
Syncellus, the Vice-Patriarch of Constantinople (eighth century), for
his audacious falsification of the Egyptian Chronology. The opinion of
Socrates, an historian of the fifth century, is no more flattering. He fearlessly
charges Eusebius with perverting historical dates, in order to please
the Emperor Constantine. In his chronographic work, before proceeding
to falsify the synchronistic tables <em>himself</em>, in order to impart to Scriptural
chronology a more trustworthy appearance, Syncellus covers Eusebius
with the choicest of monkish Billingsgate. <em>Baron Bunsen has verified
the justness if not justified the politeness of this abusive reprehension.</em>
His elaborate researches in the rectification of the <cite>Egyptian List of
Chronology</cite>, by Manetho, led him to confess that throughout his work,
the Bishop of Cæsarea “had undertaken, in a very <em>unscrupulous</em> and
arbitrary spirit, to mutilate history.” “Eusebius,” he says, “is the originator
of that systematic theory of synchronisms which has so often subsequently
maimed and mutilated history in its procrustean
 <span class="lock">bed.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_676" id="FNanchor_676">[676]</a></span>
 To
this the author of the <cite>Intellectual Development of Europe</cite> adds: “Among
those who have been the most guilty of this offense, the name of the
celebrated Eusebius, the Bishop of Cæsarea ... should be
 <span class="lock">designated!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_677" id="FNanchor_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>It will not be amiss to remind the reader that it is the same Eusebius
who is charged with the interpolation of the famous paragraph concerning

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>

 <span class="lock">Jesus,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_678" id="FNanchor_678">[678]</a></span>
 which was so miraculously found, in his time, in the writings of
Josephus, the sentence in question having till that time remained perfectly
unknown. Renan, in his <cite>Life of Jesus</cite>, expresses a contrary opinion.
“I believe,” says he, “the passage respecting Jesus to be authentic. <em>It
is perfectly in the style of Josephus</em>; and, <em>if</em> this historian had made mention
of Jesus, it is <em>thus</em> that he must have spoken of him.”</p>

<p>Begging this eminent scholar’s pardon, we must again contradict him.
Laying aside his cautious “<em>if</em>,” we will merely show that though the short
paragraph may possibly be genuine, and “perfectly in the style of Josephus,”
its several parentheses are most palpably later forgeries; and “<em>if</em>”
Josephus had made any mention of Christ at all, it is <em>not</em> thus that he would
“have spoken of him.” The whole paragraph consists of but a few lines,
and reads: “At this time was <i>Iasous</i>, a ‘<span class="allsmcap">WISE</span>
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>,’<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_679" id="FNanchor_679">[679]</a></span>
 if, at least, <em>it is
right to call him a man</em>! (ἄνδρα) for he was a doer of surprising works,
and a teacher of such men as receive “the truths” with pleasure....
<em>This was the</em> <span class="smcap">Anointed</span> (!!). And, on an accusation by the first men
among us, having been condemned by Pilate to the cross, they did not
stop loving him who loved them. For <em>he appeared to them on the third
day alive</em>, and the divine prophets having said these and many other
wonderful things concerning him.”</p>

<p>This paragraph (of sixteen lines in the original) has two unequivocal
assertions and one qualification. The latter is expressed in the following
sentence: “If, at least, it is right to call him a man.” The unequivocal
assertions are contained in “This is the <span class="smcap">Anointed</span>,” and in
that Jesus “appeared to them <em>on the third day alive</em>.” History shows
us Josephus as a thorough, uncompromising, stiff-necked, orthodox Jew,
though he wrote for “the Pagans.” It is well to observe the false position
in which these sentences would have placed a true-born Jew, if they
had really emanated from him. Their “Messiah” was then and is still
expected. The Messiah is the <em>Anointed</em>, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. And Josephus
is made to admit that the “first men” among them have accused and
crucified <i>their</i> Messiah and Anointed!! No need to comment any further
upon such a preposterous
 <span class="lock">incongruity,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_680" id="FNanchor_680">[680]</a></span>
 even though supported by
so ripe a scholar as Renan.</p>

<p>As to that patristic fire-brand, Tertullian, whom des Mousseaux
apotheosizes in company with his other demi-gods, he is regarded by
Reuss, Baur, and Schweigler, in quite a different light. The untrustworthiness
of statement and inaccuracy of Tertullian, says the author

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>

of <cite>Supernatural Religion</cite>, are often apparent. Reuss characterizes his
Christianism as “<cite>âpre</cite>, <cite>insolent</cite>, <cite>brutal</cite>, <cite>ferrailleur</cite>.” It is without
unction and without charity, sometimes even <em>without loyalty</em>, when he
finds himself confronted with opposition. “If,” remarks this author,
“in the second century all parties except certain Gnostics were intolerant,
Tertullian was the most intolerant of all!”</p>

<p>The work begun by the early Fathers was achieved by the sophomorical
Augustine. His supra-transcendental speculations on the Trinity;
his imaginary dialogues with the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and the <em>disclosures</em> and covert allusions about his ex-brethren, the
Manicheans, have led the world to load Gnosticism with opprobrium, and
have thrown into a deep shadow the insulted majesty of the one God,
worshipped in reverential silence by every “heathen.”</p>

<p><em>And thus is it that the whole pyramid of Roman Catholic dogmas
rests not upon proof, but upon assumption.</em> The Gnostics had cornered
the Fathers too cleverly, and <em>the only salvation of the latter was a resort
to forgery</em>. For nearly four centuries, the great historians nearly cotemporary
with Jesus had not taken the slightest notice either of his life or
death. Christians wondered at such an unaccountable omission of what the
Church considered the greatest events in the world’s history. Eusebius
saved the battle of the day. Such are the men who have slandered
the Gnostics.</p>

<p>The first and most unimportant sect we hear of is that of the <i>Nicolaïtans</i>,
of whom John, in the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>, makes the voice in his vision
say that he hates their
 <span class="lock">doctrine.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_681" id="FNanchor_681">[681]</a></span>
 These Nicolaïtans were the followers,
however, of Nicolas of Antioch, one of the “seven” chosen by the
“twelve” to make distribution from the common fund to the proselytes at
Jerusalem (<cite>Acts</cite> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 44, 45, <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 1-5), hardly more than a few weeks, or
perhaps months, after the
 <span class="lock">Crucifixion;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_682" id="FNanchor_682">[682]</a></span>
 and a man “of honest report,
<em>full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom</em>” (verse 3). Thus it would appear that
the “Holy Ghost and wisdom” from on high, were no more a shield
against the accusation of “hæresy” than though they had never overshadowed
the “chosen ones” of the apostles.</p>

<p>It would be but too easy to detect what kind of heresy it was that
offended, even had we not other and more authentic sources of information
in the kabalistic writings. The accusation and the precise nature
of the “abomination” are stated in the second chapter of the book of
<cite>Revelation</cite>, verses 14, 15. The sin was merely—<em>marriage</em>. John was a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>

“virgin;” several of the Fathers assert the fact on the authority of
tradition. Even Paul, the most liberal and high-minded of them all,
finds it difficult to reconcile the position of a married man with that of
a faithful servant of God. There is also “a difference between a wife
and a
 <span class="lock">virgin.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_683" id="FNanchor_683">[683]</a></span>
 The latter cares “for the things of the Lord,” and the
former only for “how she may please her husband.” “If any man think
that he behaveth uncomely towards his virgin ... let them marry.
Nevertheless, he that standeth steadfast in his heart, and hath power over
his own will, and hath so decreed ... that he will keep <em>his virgin</em>,
doeth well.” So that he who marries “doeth well ... but he that
giveth her not in marriage <em>doeth better</em>.” “Art thou loosed from a
wife?” he asks, “seek not a wife” (27). And remarking that according
to his judgment, both will be happier if they do not marry, he
adds, as a weighty conclusion: “And I think also that I have the spirit
of God” (40). Far from this spirit of tolerance are the words of
John. According to his vision there are “but the hundred and forty and
four thousand, which were <em>redeemed</em> from the earth,” and “these are
they which were not defiled with women; for <em>they were</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>virgins</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_684" id="FNanchor_684">[684]</a></span>
 This
seems conclusive; for except Paul there is not one of these primitive
<i>Nazari</i>, there “set apart” and vowed to God, who seemed to make a
great difference between “sin” within the relationship of legal marriage,
and the “abomination” of adultery.</p>

<p>With such views and such narrow-mindedness, it was but natural that
these fanatics should have begun by casting this <em>iniquity</em> as a slur in the
faces of brethren, and then “bearing on progressively” with their accusations.
As we have already shown, it is only Epiphanius whom we find
giving such minute details as to the Masonic “grips” and other signs of
recognition among the Gnostics. He had once belonged to their number,
and therefore it was easy for him to furnish particulars. Only how
far the worthy Bishop is to be relied upon is a very grave question. One
need fathom human nature but very superficially to find that there seldom
was yet a traitor, a renegade, who, in a moment of danger turned
“State’s evidence,” who would not lie as remorselessly as he betrayed.
Men never forgive or relent toward those whom they injure. We hate
our victims in proportion to the harm we do them. This is a truth as old
as the world. On the other hand, it is preposterous to believe that such
persons as the Gnostics, who, according to Gibbon, were the wealthiest,
proudest, most polite, as well as the most learned “of the Christian
name,” were guilty of the disgusting, libidinous actions of which Epiphanius
delights to accuse them. Were they even like that “set of tatterdemalions,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>

almost naked, with fierce looks,” that Lucian describes as Paul’s
 <span class="lock">followers,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_685" id="FNanchor_685">[685]</a></span>
 we would hesitate to believe such an infamous story. How
much less probable then that men who were Platonists, as well as Christians,
should have ever been guilty of such preposterous rites.</p>

<p>Payne Knight seems never to suspect the testimony of Epiphanius.
He argues that “if we make allowance for the willing exaggerations of
religious hatred, and consequent popular prejudice, the general conviction
that these sectarians had rites and practices of a licentious character
appears too strong to be entirely disregarded.” If he draws an honest
line of demarcation between the Gnostics of the first three centuries and
those mediæval sects whose doctrines “rather closely resembled modern
communism,” we have nothing to say. Only, we would beg every critic
to remember that if the Templars were accused of that most “abominable
crime” of applying the “holy kiss” to the root of Baphomet’s
 <span class="lock">tail,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_686" id="FNanchor_686">[686]</a></span>
 <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Augustine is also suspected, and on very good grounds, too, of having
allowed his community to go somewhat astray from the primitive way of
administering the “holy kiss” at the feast of the Eucharist. The holy
Bishop seems quite too anxious as to certain details of the ladies’ toilet
for the “kiss” to be of a strictly orthodox
 <span class="lock">nature.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_687" id="FNanchor_687">[687]</a></span>
 Wherever there
lurks a true and sincere religious feeling, there is no room for worldly
details.</p>

<p>Considering the extraordinary dislike exhibited from the first by Christians
to all manner of cleanliness, we cannot enough wonder at such
a strange solicitude on the part of the holy Bishop for his female parishioners,
unless, indeed, we have to excuse it on the ground of a lingering
reminiscence of Manichean rites!</p>

<p>It would be hard, indeed, to blame any writer for entertaining such
suspicions of immorality as those above noticed, when the records of many
historians are at hand to help us to make an impartial investigation.
“Hæretics” are accused of crimes in which the Church has more or less
openly indulged even down to the beginning of our century. In 1233
Pope Gregory <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr> issued two bulls against the Stedingers “for various
<em>heathen</em> and magical
 <span class="lock">practices,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_688" id="FNanchor_688">[688]</a></span>
 and the latter, as a matter of course, were
exterminated in the name of Christ and his Holy Mother. In 1282 a
parish priest of Inverkeithing, named John, performed rites on Easter day
by far worse than “magical.” Collecting a crowd of young girls, he forced
them to enter into “divine ecstasies” and Bacchanalian fury, dancing the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>

old Amazonian circle-dance around the figure of the heathen “god of the
gardens.” Notwithstanding that upon the complaint of some of his
parishioners he was cited before his bishop, he retained his benefice
because he proved that <em>such was the common usage of the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>country</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_689" id="FNanchor_689">[689]</a></span>
 The
Waldenses, those “earliest Protestants,” were accused of the most unnatural
horrors; burned, butchered, and exterminated for calumnies heaped
upon them by their accusers. Meanwhile the latter, in open triumph,
forming their heathen processions of “Corpus Christi,” with emblems
modelled on those of Baal-Peor and “Osiris,” and every city in Southern
France carrying, in yearly processions on Easter days, loaves and cakes
fashioned like the so-much-decried emblems of the Hindu Sivites and
Vishnites, as late as
 <span class="lock">1825!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_690" id="FNanchor_690">[690]</a></span></p>

<p>Deprived of their old means for slandering Christian sects whose religious
views differ from their own, it is now the turn of the “heathen,”
Hindus, Chinese, and Japanese, to share with the ancient religions the
honor of having cast in their teeth denunciations of their “libidinous
religions.”</p>

<p>Without going far for proofs of equal if not surpassing immorality, we
would remind Roman Catholic writers of certain <i lang="fr">bas-reliefs</i> on the doors of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s Cathedral. They are as brazen-faced as the door itself; but
less so than any author, who, knowing all this, feigns to ignore historical
facts. A long succession of Popes have reposed their pastoral eyes upon
these brazen pictures of the vilest obscenity, through those many centuries,
without ever finding the slightest necessity for removing them.
Quite the contrary; for we might name certain Popes and Cardinals who
made it a life-long study to copy these heathen suggestions of “nature-gods,”
in practice as well as in theory.</p>

<p>In Polish Podolia there was some years ago, in a Roman Catholic
Church, a statue of Christ, in black marble. It was reputed to perform
miracles on certain days, such as having its hair and beard grow in the
sight of the public, and indulging in other <em>less</em> innocent wonders. This
show was finally prohibited by the Russian Government. When in 1585
the Protestants took Embrun (Department of the Upper Alps), they
found in the churches of this town relics of such a character, that, as the
Chronicle expresses it, “old Huguenot soldiers were seen to blush,
several weeks after, at the bare mention of the discovery.” In a corner
of the Church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Fiacre, near Monceaux, in France, there was—and
it still is there, if we mistake not—a seat called “the chair of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Fiacre,”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>

which had the reputation of conferring fecundity upon barren women. A
rock in the vicinity of Athens, not far from the so-called “Tomb of
Socrates,” is said to be possessed of the same virtue. When, some
twenty years since, the Queen Amelia, perhaps in a merry moment, was
said to have tried the experiment, there was no end of most insulting
abuse heaped upon her, by a Catholic Padre, on his way through Syra to
some mission. The Queen, he declared, was a “superstitious heretic!”
“an abominable witch!” “Jezebel using magic arts.” Much more the
zealous missionary would doubtless have added, had he not found himself,
right in the middle of his vituperations, landed in a pool of mud, outside
the window. The virtuous elocutionist was forced to this unusual transit
by the strong arm of a Greek officer, who happened to enter the room at
the right moment.</p>

<p>There never was a great religious reform that was not pure at the
beginning. The first followers of Buddha, as well as the disciples of Jesus,
were all men of the highest morality. The aversion felt by the reformers
of all ages to vice under any shape, is proved in the cases of Sâkya-muni,
Pythagoras, Plato, Jesus, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, Ammonius Sakkas. The great Gnostic
leaders—if less successful—were not less virtuous in practice nor less
morally pure. Marcion,
 <span class="lock">Basilides,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_691" id="FNanchor_691">[691]</a></span>
 Valentinus, were renowned for their
ascetic lives. The Nicolaïtans, who, if they did not belong to the great
body of the Ophites, were numbered among the small sects which were
absorbed in it at the beginning of the second century, owe their origin, as
we have shown, to Nicolas of Antioch, “a man of honest report, full of
the Holy Ghost and wisdom.” How absurd the idea that such men
would have instituted “libidinous rites.” As well accuse Jesus of having
promoted the similar rites which we find practiced so extensively by
the mediæval <em>orthodox</em> Christians behind the secure shelter of monastic
walls.</p>

<p>If, however, we are asked to credit such an accusation against the
Gnostics, an accusation transferred with tenfold acrimony, centuries
later, to the unfortunate heads of the Templars, why should we not believe
the same of the orthodox Christians? Minucius Felix states that
“the first Christians were accused by the world of inducing, during the
ceremony of the “Perfect Passover,” each neophyte, on his admission,
to plunge a knife into an infant concealed under a heap of flour; the
body then serving for a banquet to the whole congregation. After they
had become the dominant party, they (the Christians) transferred this
charge to their own
 <span class="lock">dissenters.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_692" id="FNanchor_692">[692]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>

The real crime of heterodoxy is plainly stated by John in his <cite>Epistles</cite>
and <cite>Gospel</cite>. “He that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the
flesh ... is a deceiver and <em>an antichrist</em>” (2 <cite>Epistle</cite> 7). In his previous
<cite>Epistle</cite>, he teaches his flock that there are <em>two</em> trinities (7, 8)—in short,
the Nazarene system.</p>

<p>The inference to be drawn from all this is, that the made-up and dogmatic
Christianity of the Constantinian period is simply an offspring of the
numerous conflicting sects, half-castes themselves, born of Pagan parents.
Each of these could claim representatives converted to the so-called <em>orthodox</em>
body of Christians. And, as every newly-born dogma had to be carried
out by the majority of votes, every sect colored the main substance with
its own hue, till the moment when the emperor enforced this <em>revealed</em>
olla-podrida, of which he evidently did not himself understand a word,
upon an unwilling world as the <em>religion of Christ</em>. Wearied in the vain
attempt to sound this fathomless bog of international speculations, unable
to appreciate a religion based on the pure spirituality of an ideal conception,
Christendom gave itself up to the adoration of brutal force as
represented by a Church backed up by Constantine. Since then, among
the thousand rites, dogmas, and ceremonies copied from Paganism, the
Church can claim but one invention as thoroughly original with her—namely,
the doctrine of eternal damnation, and one custom, that of the
anathema. The Pagans rejected both with horror. “An execration is a
fearful and grievous thing,” says Plutarch. “Wherefore, the priestess at
Athens was commended for refusing to curse Alkibiades (for desecration
of the Mysteries) when the people required her to do it; <em>for</em>, she said,
<em>that she was a priestess of prayers and not of</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>curses</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_693" id="FNanchor_693">[693]</a></span></p>

<p>“Deep researches would show,” says Renan, “that nearly everything
in Christianity is mere baggage brought from the Pagan Mysteries. The
primitive Christian worship is nothing but a mystery. The whole interior
police of the Church, the degrees of initiation, the command of silence,
and a crowd of phrases in the ecclesiastical language, have no other
origin.... The revolution which overthrew Paganism <em>seems</em> at first
glance ... an absolute rupture with the past ... but <em>the popular faith
saved its most familiar symbols from shipwreck</em>. Christianity introduced,
at first, so little change into the habits of private and social life, that with
great numbers in the fourth and fifth centuries it remains uncertain whether
they were Pagans or Christians; many seem even to have pursued an
irresolute course between the two worships.” Speaking further of <em>Art</em>,
which formed an essential part of the ancient religion, he says that “<cite>it
had to break with scarce one of its traditions</cite>. Primitive Christian art is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>

really nothing but Pagan art in its decay, or in its lower departments.
The Good Shepherd of the catacombs in Rome is a copy from the Aristeus,
or from the Apollo Nornius, which figure in the same posture on the
Pagan sarcophagi, and still carries the flute of Pan in the midst of the four
half-naked seasons. On the Christian tombs of the Cemetery of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Calixtus,
Orpheus charms the animals. Elsewhere, the Christ as Jupiter-Pluto,
and Mary as Proserpina, receive the souls that Mercury, wearing
the broad-brimmed hat and carrying in his hand the rod of the soul-guide
(<i>psychopompos</i>), brings to them, in presence of the three fates. Pegasus,
the symbol of the apotheosis; Psyche, the symbol of the immortal soul;
Heaven, personified by an old man, the river Jordan; and Victory, figure
on a host of Christian monuments.”</p>

<p>As we have elsewhere shown, the primitive Christian community was
composed of small groups scattered about and organized in secret societies,
with passwords, grips, and signs. To avoid the relentless persecutions
of their enemies, they were obliged to seek safety and hold meetings in
deserted catacombs, the fastnesses of mountains, and other safe retreats.
Like disabilities were naturally encountered by each religious reform
at its inception. From the very first appearance of Jesus and his twelve
disciples, we see them congregating apart, having secure refuges in the
wilderness, and among friends in Bethany, and elsewhere. Were Christianity
not composed of “<em>secret communities</em>,” from the start, history
would have more <em>facts</em> to record of its founder and disciples than it has.</p>

<p>How little Jesus had impressed his personality upon his own century,
is calculated to astound the inquirer. Renan shows that Philo, who died
toward the year 50, and who was born many years earlier than Jesus, living
all the while in Palestine while the “glad tidings” were being preached
all over the country, according to the <cite>Gospels</cite>, had never heard of him!
Josephus, the historian, who was born three or four years after the death
of Jesus, mentions his execution in a short sentence, and even those few
words were altered “by a <em>Christian hand</em>,” says the author of the <cite>Life
of Jesus</cite>. Writing at the close of the first century, when Paul, the learned
propagandist, is said to have founded so many churches, and Peter is
alleged to have established the apostolic succession, which the Irenæo-Eusebian
chronology shows to have already included three bishops of
 <span class="lock">Rome,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_694" id="FNanchor_694">[694]</a></span>
 Josephus, the painstaking enumerator and careful historian of
even the most unimportant sects, entirely ignores the existence of a
Christian sect. Suetonius, secretary of Adrian, writing in the first quarter
of the second century, knows so little of Jesus or his history as to say
that the Emperor Claudius “banished all the Jews, who were continually

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>

making disturbances, at the instigation of one <i>Crestus</i>,” meaning Christ,
we must
 <span class="lock">suppose.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_695" id="FNanchor_695">[695]</a></span>
 The Emperor Adrian himself, writing still later, was
so little impressed with the tenets or importance of the new sect, that in
a letter to Servianus he shows that he believes the Christians to be worshippers
of <span class="lock">Serapis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_696" id="FNanchor_696">[696]</a></span>
 “In the second century,” says C. W. King, “the
syncretistic sects that had sprung up in Alexandria, the very hot-bed of
Gnosticism, found out in Serapis a prophetic type of Christ as the Lord
and Creator of all, and Judge of the living and the
 <span class="lock">dead.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_697" id="FNanchor_697">[697]</a></span>
 Thus, while
the “Pagan” philosophers had never viewed Serapis, or rather the
abstract idea which was embodied in him, as otherwise than a representation
of the Anima Mundi, the Christians anthropomorphized the “Son
of God” and his “Father,” finding no better model for him than the idol
of a Pagan myth! “There can be no doubt,” remarks the same author,
“that the head of Serapis, marked, as the face is, by a grave and pensive
majesty, supplied the first idea for the conventional portraits of the
<span class="lock">Saviour.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_698" id="FNanchor_698">[698]</a></span></p>

<p>In the notes taken by a traveller—whose episode with the monks
on Mount Athos we have mentioned elsewhere—we find that, during
his early life, Jesus had frequent intercourse with the Essenes belonging
to the Pythagorean school, and known as the Koinobi. We believe it
rather hazardous on the part of Renan to assert so dogmatically, as he
does, that Jesus “ignored the very name of Buddha, of Zoroaster, of
Plato;” that he had never read a Greek nor a Buddhistic book, “although
he had more than one element in him, which, unawares to himself,
proceeded from Buddhism, Parsism, and the Greek
 <span class="lock">wisdom.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_699" id="FNanchor_699">[699]</a></span>
 This
is conceding half a miracle, and allowing as much to chance and coincidence.
It is an abuse of privilege, when an author, who claims to write
historical facts, draws convenient deductions from hypothetical premises,
and then calls it a biography—a <em>Life</em> of Jesus. No more than any other
compiler of legends concerning the problematical history of the Nazarene
prophet, has Renan one inch of secure foothold upon which to
maintain himself; nor can any one else assert a claim to the contrary,
except on inferential evidence. And yet, while Renan has not one
solitary fact to show that Jesus had never studied the metaphysical tenets
of Buddhism and Parsism, or heard of the philosophy of Plato, his opponents

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>

have the best reasons in the world to suspect the contrary. When
they find that—1, all his sayings are in a Pythagorean spirit, when not
<em>verbatim</em> repetitions; 2, his code of ethics is purely Buddhistic; 3, his
mode of action and walk in life, Essenean; and 4, his mystical mode of expression,
his parables, and his ways, those of an initiate, whether Grecian,
Chaldean, or Magian (for the “Perfect,” who spoke the <em>hidden</em> wisdom,
were of the same school of archaic learning the world over), it is difficult
to escape from the logical conclusion that he belonged to that same body
of initiates. It is a poor compliment paid the Supreme, this forcing upon
Him four gospels, in which, contradictory as they often are, there is not
a single narrative, sentence, or peculiar expression, whose parallel may
not be found in some older doctrine or philosophy. Surely, the Almighty—were
it but to spare future generations their present perplexity—might
have brought down with Him, at His <em>first and only</em> incarnation on earth,
something original—something that would trace a distinct line of demarcation
between Himself and the score or so of incarnate Pagan gods, who
had been born of virgins, had all been saviours, and were either killed, or
otherwise sacrificed themselves for humanity.</p>

<p>Too much has already been conceded to the emotional side of the
story. What the world needs is a less exalted, but more faithful view of
a personage, in whose favor nearly half of Christendom has dethroned
the Almighty. It is not the erudite, world-famous scholar, whom we
question for what we find in his <cite lang="fr">Vie de Jesus</cite>,
 nor is it one of his <em>historical</em>
statements. We simply challenge a few unwarranted and untenable
assertions that have found their way past the emotional narrator, into the
otherwise beautiful pages of the work—a life built altogether on mere
probabilities, and yet that of one who, if accepted as an historical personage,
has far greater claims upon our love and veneration, fallible as he is
with all his greatness, than if we figure him as an omnipotent God. It is
but in the latter character that Jesus must be regarded by every reverential
mind as a failure.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the paucity of old philosophical works now extant, we
could find no end of instances of perfect identity between Pythagorean,
Hindu, and <cite>New Testament</cite> sayings. There is no lack of proofs upon
this point. What is needed is a Christian public that will examine what
will be offered, and show common honesty in rendering its verdict.
Bigotry has had its day, and done its worst. “We need not be frightened,”
says Professor Müller, “if we discover traces of truth, traces even of
Christian truth, among the sages and lawgivers of other nations.”</p>

<p>Plato did not conceal the fact that he derived his best philosophical
doctrines from Pythagoras, and that himself was merely the first to reduce
them to systematic order, occasionally interweaving with them metaphysical
speculations of his own. But Pythagoras himself got his recondite
doctrines, first from the descendants of Mochus, and later, from the Brahmans
of India. He was also initiated into the Mysteries among the
hierophants of Thebes, the Persian and Chaldean Magi. Thus, step by
step do we trace the origin of most of our Christian doctrines to Middle
Asia. Drop out from Christianity the personality of Jesus, so sublime,
because of its unparalleled simplicity, and what remains? History and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>

comparative theology echo back the melancholy answer, “A crumbling
skeleton formed of the oldest Pagan myths!”</p>

<p>While the mythical birth and life of Jesus are a faithful copy of
those of the Brahmanical Christna, his historical character of a religious
reformer in Palestine is the true type of Buddha in India. In more
than one respect their great resemblance in philanthropic and spiritual
aspirations, as well as external circumstances is truly striking. Though
the son of a king, while Jesus was but a carpenter, Buddha was not of
the high Brahmanical caste by birth. Like Jesus, he felt dissatisfied with
the dogmatic spirit of the religion of his country, the intolerance and
hypocrisy of the priesthood, their outward show of devotion, and their
useless ceremonials and prayers. As Buddha broke violently through the
traditional laws and rules of the Brahmans, so did Jesus declare war
against the Pharisees, and the proud Sadducees. What the Nazarene
did as a consequence of his humble birth and position, Buddha did as a
voluntary penance. He travelled about as a beggar; and—again like
Jesus—later in life he sought by preference the companionship of publicans
and sinners. Each aimed at a social as well as at a religious
reform; and giving a death-blow to the old religions of his countries,
each became the founder of a new one.</p>

<p>“The reform of Buddha,” says Max Müller, “had originally much
more of a social than of a religious character. The most important element
of Buddhist reform has always been its social and moral code, not
its metaphysical theories. <em>That moral code is one of the most perfect
which the world has ever known</em> ... and he whose meditations had
been how to deliver the soul of man from misery and the fear of death, had
delivered the people of India from a degrading thraldom and from
priestly tyranny.” Further, the lecturer adds that were it otherwise,
“Buddha might have taught whatever philosophy he pleased, and we
should hardly have heard his name. The people would not have minded
him, and his system would only have been a drop in the ocean of philosophic
speculation by which India was deluged at all
 <span class="lock">times.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_701" id="FNanchor_701">[701]</a></span></p>

<p>The same with Jesus. While Philo, whom Renan calls Jesus’s elder
brother, Hillel, Shammai, and Gamaliel, are hardly mentioned—Jesus
has become a God! And still, pure and divine as was the moral code
taught by Christ, it never could have borne comparison with that of
Buddha, but for the tragedy of Calvary. That which helped forward the
deification of Jesus was his dramatic death, the voluntary sacrifice of his
life, alleged to have been made for the sake of mankind, and the later
convenient dogma of the atonement, invented by the Christians. In

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340">340</a></span>

India, where life is valued as of no account, the crucifixion would have
produced little effect, if any. In a country where—as all the Indianists
are well aware—religious fanatics set themselves to dying by inches,
in penances lasting for years; where the most fearful macerations are
self-inflicted by fakirs; where young and delicate widows, in a spirit of
bravado against the government, as much as out of religious fanaticism,
mount the funeral pile with a smile on their face; where, to quote the words
of the great lecturer, “Men in the prime of life throw themselves under
the car of Juggernâth, to be crushed to death by the idol they believe in,
where the plaintiff who cannot get redress starves himself to death at
the door of his judge; where the philosopher who thinks he has learned
all which this world can teach him, and who longs for absorption into the
Deity, quietly steps into the Ganges, in order to arrive at the other shore
of
 <span class="lock">existence,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_702" id="FNanchor_702">[702]</a></span>
 in such a country even a voluntary crucifixion would
have passed unnoticed. In Judea, and even among braver nations than the
Jews—the Romans and the Greeks—where every one clung more or less
to life, and most people would have fought for it with desperation, the
tragical end of the great Reformer was calculated to produce a profound
impression. The names of even such minor heroes as Mutius Scævola,
Horatius Cocles, the mother of the Gracchi, and others, have descended
to posterity; and, during our school-days, as well as later in life, their
histories have awakened our sympathy and commanded a reverential admiration.
But, can we ever forget the scornful smile of certain Hindus,
at Benares, when an English lady, the wife of a clergyman, tried to
impress them with the greatness of the sacrifice of Jesus, in giving <em>his</em>
life for us? Then, for the first time the idea struck us how much the
pathos of the great drama of Calvary had to do with subsequent events
in the foundation of Christianity. Even the imaginative Renan was
moved by this feeling to write in the last chapter of his <cite lang="fr">Vie de Jesus</cite>, a
few pages of singular and sympathetic
 <span class="lock">beauty.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_703" id="FNanchor_703">[703]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>

Apollonius, a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, was, like him, an
enthusiastic founder of a new spiritual school. Perhaps less metaphysical
and more practical than Jesus, less tender and perfect in his nature, he
nevertheless inculcated the same quintessence of spirituality, and the
same high moral truths. His great mistake was to confine them too
closely to the higher classes of society. While to the poor and the humble
Jesus preached “Peace on earth and good will to men,” Apollonius was
the friend of kings, and moved with the aristocracy. He was born among
the latter, and himself a man of wealth, while the “Son of man,” representing
the people, “had not where to lay his head;” nevertheless,
the two “miracle-workers” exhibited striking similarity of purpose. Still
earlier than Apollonius had appeared Simon Magus, called “the great
Power of God.” His “miracles” are both more wonderful, more varied,
and better attested than those either of the apostles or of the Galilean
philosopher himself. Materialism denies the fact in both cases, but history
affirms. Apollonius followed both; and how great and renowned
were his miraculous works in comparison with those of the alleged
founder of Christianity as the kabalists claim, we have history again, and
Justin Martyr, to
 <span class="lock">corroborate.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_704" id="FNanchor_704">[704]</a></span></p>

<p>Like Buddha and Jesus, Apollonius was the uncompromising enemy
of all outward show of piety, all display of useless religious ceremonies
and hypocrisy. If, like the Christian Saviour, the sage of Tyana had
by preference sought the companionship of the poor and humble; and
if instead of dying comfortably, at over one hundred years of age, he had
been a voluntary martyr, proclaiming divine Truth from a
 <span class="lock">cross,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_705" id="FNanchor_705">[705]</a></span>
 his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>

blood might have proved as efficacious for the subsequent dissemination
of spiritual doctrines as that of the Christian Messiah.</p>

<p>The calumnies set afloat against Apollonius, were as numerous as
they were false. So late as eighteen centuries after his death he was
defamed by Bishop Douglas in his work against miracles. In this the
Right Reverend bishop crushed himself against historical facts. If we
study the question with a dispassionate mind, we will soon perceive that
the ethics of Gautama-Buddha, Plato, Apollonius, Jesus, Ammonius Sakkas,
and his disciples, were all based on the same mystic philosophy.
That all worshipped one God, whether they considered Him as the
“Father” of humanity, who lives in man as man lives in Him, or as the
Incomprehensible Creative Principle; all led God-like lives. Ammonius,
speaking of his philosophy, taught that their school dated from the days of
Hermes, who brought his wisdom from India. It was the same mystical
contemplation throughout, as that of the Yogin: the communion of the
Brahman with his own luminous Self—the “Atman.” And this Hindu
term is again kabalistic, <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. Who is “Self?” is asked in the
<cite>Rig-Veda</cite>; “Self is the Lord of all things ... all things are contained in
this Self; all selves are contained in this Self. Brahmân itself is but
 <span class="lock">Self,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_706" id="FNanchor_706">[706]</a></span>
 is the answer. Says Idra Rabba: “All things are Himself, and
Himself is <i>concealed</i> on every
 <span class="lock">side.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_707" id="FNanchor_707">[707]</a></span>
 The “Adam Kadmon of the
kabalists contains in himself all the souls of the Israelites, and he is himself
in every soul,” says the
 <span class="lock"><cite>Sohar</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_708" id="FNanchor_708">[708]</a></span>
 The groundwork of the Eclectic
School was thus identical with the doctrines of the Yogin, the Hindu mystics,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>

and the earlier Buddhism of the disciples of Gautama. And when
Jesus assured his disciples that “the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
receive because <em>it seeth Him not</em>, neither knoweth Him,” dwells
<em>with</em> and <em>in</em> them, who “are in Him and He in
 <span class="lock">them,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_709" id="FNanchor_709">[709]</a></span>
 he but expounded
the same tenet that we find running through every philosophy
worthy of that name.</p>

<p>Laboulaye, the learned and skeptical French savant, does not believe
a word of the miraculous portion of Buddha’s life; nevertheless, he has
the candor to speak of Gautama as being <em>only second to</em> Christ in the
great purity of his ethics and personal morality. For both of these
opinions he is respectfully rebuked by des Mousseaux. Vexed at this
scientific contradiction of his accusations of demonolatry against Gautama-Buddha,
he assures his readers that <span lang="fr">“ce savant distingué n’a point
etudié cette</span>
 <span class="lock">question.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_710" id="FNanchor_710">[710]</a></span></p>

<p>“I do not hesitate to say,” remarks in his turn Barthelemy <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilaire,
“that, except Christ alone, there is not among the founders of religions,
a figure either more pure or more touching than that of Buddha. His
life is spotless. His constant heroism equals his convictions.... He
is the perfect model of all the virtues he preaches; his abnegation, his
charity, his unalterable sweetness of disposition, do not fail him for one
instant. He abandoned, at the age of twenty-nine, his father’s court to
become a monk and a beggar ... and when he dies in the arms of his
disciples, it is with the serenity of a sage who practiced virtue all his life,
and who dies convinced of having found the
 <span class="lock">truth.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_711" id="FNanchor_711">[711]</a></span>
 This deserved panegyric
is no stronger than the one which Laboulaye himself pronounced,
and which occasioned des Mousseaux’s wrath. “It is more than difficult,”
adds the former, “to understand how men not assisted by revelation could
have soared so high and approached so near the
 <span class="lock">truth.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_712" id="FNanchor_712">[712]</a></span>
 Curious that
there should be so many lofty souls “not assisted by revelation!”</p>

<p>And why should any one feel surprised that Gautama could die with
philosophical serenity? As the kabalists justly say, “Death does not
exist, and man never steps outside of universal life. Those whom we
think dead live still in us, as we live in them.... The more one lives
for his kind, the less need he fear to
 <span class="lock">die.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_713" id="FNanchor_713">[713]</a></span>
 And, we might add, that he
who <em>lives</em> for humanity does even more than him who dies for it.</p>

<p>The <em>Ineffable name</em>, in the search for which so many kabalists—unacquainted
with any Oriental or even European adept—vainly consume
their knowledge and lives, dwells latent in the heart of every man. This

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>

mirific name which, according to the most ancient oracles, “rushes into the
infinite worlds <a id="Greekch7"></a>ακοιμητω στροφαλιγγι,” can be obtained in a twofold way:
by regular initiation, and through the “small voice” which Elijah heard
in the cave of Horeb, the mount of God. And “when Elijah heard it
he wrapped his <em>face in his mantle</em> and stood in the entering of the cave.
And behold there came <em>the</em> voice.”</p>

<p>When Apollonius of Tyana desired to hear the “small voice,” he used
to wrap himself up entirely in a mantle of fine wool, on which he placed
both his feet, after having performed certain magnetic passes, and pronounced
not the “name” but an invocation well known to every adept.
Then he drew the mantle over his head and face, and his translucid or
astral spirit was free. On ordinary occasions he wore wool no more than
the priests of the temples. The possession of the secret combination of
the “name” gave the hierophant supreme power over every being, human
or otherwise, inferior to himself in soul-strength. Hence, when Max
Müller tells us of the Quichè “Hidden majesty which was never to be
opened by human hands,” the kabalist perfectly understands what was
meant by the expression, and is not at all surprised to hear even this most
erudite philologist exclaim: “What it was we do not know!”</p>

<p>We cannot too often repeat that it is only through the doctrines of
the more ancient philosophies that the religion preached by Jesus may be
understood. It is through Pythagoras, Confucius, and Plato, that we can
comprehend the idea which underlies the term “Father” in the <cite>New Testament</cite>.
Plato’s ideal of the Deity, whom he terms the one everlasting,
invisible God, the Fashioner and Father of all
 <span class="lock">things,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_714" id="FNanchor_714">[714]</a></span>
 is rather the
“Father” of Jesus. It is this Divine Being of whom the Grecian sage
says that He can neither be envious nor the originator of evil, for He can
produce nothing but what is good and
 <span class="lock">just,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_715" id="FNanchor_715">[715]</a></span>
 is certainly not the Mosaic
Jehovah, the “<em>jealous</em> God,” but the God of Jesus, who “alone is good.”
He extols His all-embracing, divine
 <span class="lock">power,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_716" id="FNanchor_716">[716]</a></span>
 and His omnipotence, but
at the same time intimates that, as He is unchangeable, He can never
desire to change his laws, <i>i.e.</i>, to extirpate evil from the world through a
 <span class="lock">miracle.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_717" id="FNanchor_717">[717]</a></span>
He is omniscient, and nothing escapes His watchful
 <span class="lock">eye.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_718" id="FNanchor_718">[718]</a></span>
His justice, which we find embodied in the law of compensation and
retribution, will leave no crime without punishment, no virtue without its
 <span class="lock">reward;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_719" id="FNanchor_719">[719]</a></span>
 and therefore he declares that the only way to honor God is to
cultivate moral purity. He utterly rejects not only the anthropomorphic

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>

idea that God could have a material
 <span class="lock">body,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_720" id="FNanchor_720">[720]</a></span>
 but “rejects with disgust
those fables which ascribe passions, quarrels, and crimes of all sorts to
the minor
 <span class="lock">gods.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_721" id="FNanchor_721">[721]</a></span>
 He indignantly denies that God allows Himself to
be propitiated, or rather bribed, by prayers and
 <span class="lock">sacrifices.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_722" id="FNanchor_722">[722]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Phædrus</cite> of Plato displays all that man once was, and that which
he may yet become again. “Before man’s spirit sank into sensuality and
was embodied with it through the loss of his wings, he lived among the
gods in the airy [spiritual] world where everything is true and pure.” In
the <cite>Timæus</cite> he says that “there was a time when mankind did not perpetuate
itself, but lived as pure spirits.” In the future world, says
Jesus, “they neither marry nor are given in marriage,” but “live as the
angels of God in Heaven.”</p>

<p>The researches of Laboulaye, Anquetil Duperron, Colebrooke, Barthelemy
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilaire, Max Müller, Spiegel, Burnouf, Wilson, and so many
other linguists, have brought some of the truth to light. And now that
the difficulties of the Sanscrit, the Thibetan, the Singhalese, the Zend,
the Pehlevi, the Chinese, and even of the Burmese, are partially conquered,
and the <cite>Vedas</cite>, and the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, the Buddhist texts, and
even Kapila’s <cite>Sûtras</cite> are translated, a door is thrown wide open, which,
once passed, must close forever behind any speculative or ignorant calumniators
of the old religions. Even till the present time, the clergy
have, to use the words of Max Müller—“generally appealed to the
deviltries and orgies of heathen worship ... but they have seldom, if
ever, endeavored to discover the true and original character of the
strange forms of faith and worship which they call the work of the
 <span class="lock">devil.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_723" id="FNanchor_723">[723]</a></span>
 When we read the true history of Buddha and Buddhism, by
Müller, and the enthusiastic opinions of both expressed by Barthelemy
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilaire, and Laboulaye; and when, finally, a Popish missionary, an
eye-witness, and one who least of all can be accused of partiality to the
Buddhists—the Abbé Huc, we mean—finds occasion for nothing but admiration
for the high individual character of these “devil-worshippers;”
we must consider Sakyâ-muni’s philosophy as something more than the
religion of fetishism and atheism, which the Catholics would have us
believe it. Huc was a missionary and it was his first duty to regard
Buddhism as no better than an outgrowth of the worship of Satan. The
poor Abbé was struck off the list of missionaries at
 <span class="lock">Rome,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_724" id="FNanchor_724">[724]</a></span>
 after his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>

book of travels was published. This illustrates how little we may expect
to learn the truth about the religions of other people, through missionaries,
when their accounts are first revised by the superior ecclesiastical
authorities, and the former severely punished for telling the truth.</p>

<p>When these men who have been and still are often termed “the obscene
ascetics,” the devotees of different sects of India in short, generally
termed “Yogi,” were asked by Marco Polo, “how it comes that they
are not ashamed to go stark naked as they do?” they answered the
inquirer of the thirteenth century as a missionary of the nineteenth was
answered. “We go naked,” they say, “because naked we came into
the world, and we desire to have nothing about us that is of this world.
Moreover, we have no sin of the flesh to be conscious of, and therefore,
we are not ashamed of our nakedness any more than you are to show
your hand or your face. You who are conscious of the sins of the flesh,
do well to have shame, and to cover your
 <span class="lock">nakedness.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_725" id="FNanchor_725">[725]</a></span></p>

<p>One could make a curious list of the excuses and explanations of
the clergy to account for similarities daily discovered between Romanism
and heathen religions. Yet the summary would invariably lead to one
sweeping claim: The doctrines of Christianity were plagiarized by the
Pagans the world over! Plato and his older Academy stole the ideas
from the Christian revelation—said the Alexandrian Fathers!! The
Brahmans and Manu borrowed from the Jesuit missionaries, and the
<cite>Bhagaved-gita</cite> was the production of Father Calmet, who transformed
Christ and John into Christna and Arjuna to fit the Hindu mind!! The
trifling fact that Buddhism and Platonism both antedated Christianity,
and the <cite>Vedas</cite> had already degenerated into Brahmanism before the days
of Moses, makes no difference. The same with regard to Apollonius
of Tyana. Although his thaumaturgical powers could not be denied in the
face of the testimony of emperors, their courts, and the populations of
several cities; and although few of these had ever heard of the Nazarene
prophet whose “miracles” had been witnessed by a few apostles only,
whose very individualities remain to this day a problem in history, yet
Apollonius has to be accepted as the “monkey of Christ.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>

If of really pious, good, and honest men, many are yet found among
the Catholic, Greek, and Protestant clergy, whose sincere faith has the
best of their reasoning powers, and who having never been among
heathen populations, are unjust only through ignorance, it is not so with
the missionaries. The invariable subterfuge of the latter is to attribute to
demonolatry the really Christ-like life of the Hindu and Buddhist
ascetics and many of the lamas. Years of sojourn among “heathen”
nations, in China, Tartary, Thibet, and Hindustan have furnished them
with ample evidence how unjustly the so-called idolators have been slandered.
The missionaries have not even the excuse of sincere faith to
give the world that they mislead; and, with very few exceptions, one
may boldly paraphrase the remark made by Garibaldi, and say that:
“<cite>A priest knows himself to be an impostor, unless he be a fool, or have
been taught to lie from boyhood</cite>.”</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> greatest of the
 kabalistic works of the Hebrews—the <cite>Sohar</cite> זהר—was
compiled by Rabbi Simeon Ben-Iochaï. According to
some critics, this was done years before the Christian era; according to
others only after the destruction of the temple. However, it was completed
only by the son of Simeon, Rabbi Eleazar, and his secretary,
Rabbi Abba; for the work is so immense and the subjects treated so
abstruse that even the whole life of this Rabbi, called the Prince of kabalists,
did not suffice for the task. On account of its being known that he
was in possession of this knowledge, and of the <i>Mercaba</i>, which insured
the reception of the “Word,” his very life was endangered, and he had to
fly to the wilderness, where he lived in a cave for twelve years, surrounded
by faithful disciples, and finally died there amid signs and
 <span class="lock">wonders.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_726" id="FNanchor_726">[726]</a></span></p>

<p>But voluminous as is the work, and containing as it does the main points
of the secret and oral tradition, it still does not embrace it all. It is well

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>

known that this venerable kabalist never imparted the most important
points of his doctrine otherwise than orally, and to a very limited number
of friends and disciples, including his only son. Therefore, without the
final initiation into the <cite>Mercaba</cite> the study of the <cite>Kabala</cite> will be ever
incomplete, and the <cite>Mercaba</cite> can be taught only in “darkness, in a
deserted place, and after many and terrific trials.” Since the death of
Simeon Ben-Iochai this hidden doctrine has remained an inviolate secret
for the outside world. Delivered <em>only as a mystery</em>, it was communicated
to the candidate orally, “<em>face to face and mouth to ear</em>.”</p>

<p>This Masonic commandment, “mouth to ear, and the word at low
breath,” is an inheritance from the Tanaïm and the old Pagan Mysteries.
Its modern use must certainly be due to the indiscretion of some renegade
kabalist, though the “word” itself is but a “substitute” for the “lost
word,” and is a comparatively modern invention, as we will further show.
The real sentence has remained forever in the sole possession of the
adepts of various countries of the Eastern and Western hemispheres. Only
a limited number among the chiefs of the Templars, and some Rosicrucians
of the seventeenth century, always in close relations with Arabian
alchemists and initiates, could really boast of its possession. From the
seventh to the fifteenth centuries there was no one who could claim it in
Europe; and although there had been alchemists before the days of Paracelsus,
he was the first who had passed through the true initiation, that
last ceremony which conferred on the adept the power of travelling toward
the “burning bush” over the holy ground, and to “burn the golden calf
in the fire, grind it to powder, and strow it upon the water.” Verily,
then, this magic <em>water</em>, and the “lost word,” resuscitated more than one
of the pre-Mosaic Adonirams, Gedaliahs, and Hiram Abiffs. The real
word now substituted by <i>Mac Benac</i> and Mah was used ages before its
pseudo-magical effect was tried on the “widow’s sons” of the last two
centuries. Who was, in fact, the first operative Mason of any consequence?
Elias Ashmole, <em>the last of the Rosicrucians and alchemists</em>.
Admitted to the freedom of the Operative Masons’ Company in London,
in 1646, he died in 1692. At that time Masonry was not what it became
later; it was neither a political nor a Christian institution, but a true
secret organization, which admitted into the ties of fellowship all men
anxious to obtain the priceless boon of liberty of conscience, and avoid
clerical
 <span class="lock">persecution.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_727" id="FNanchor_727">[727]</a></span>
 Not until about thirty years after his death did
what is now termed modern Freemasonry see the light. It was born
on the 24th day of June, 1717, in the Apple-tree Tavern, Charles Street,
Covent Garden, London. And it was then, as we are told in Anderson’s

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>

<cite>Constitutions</cite>, that the only four lodges in the south of England elected
Anthony Sayer first Grand Master of Masons. Notwithstanding its great
youth, this grand lodge has ever claimed the acknowledgment of its supremacy
by the whole body of the fraternity throughout the whole world, as
the Latin inscription on the plate put beneath the corner-stone of Freemasons’
Hall, London, in 1775, would tell to those who could see it. But
of this more anon.</p>

<p>In <cite lang="de">Die Kabbala</cite>, by Franck, the author, following its “esoteric ravings,”
as he expresses it, gives us, in addition to the translations, his
commentaries. Speaking of his predecessors, he says that Simeon Ben-Iochai
mentions repeatedly what the “companions” have taught in the older
works. And the author cites one “Ieba, the <em>old</em>, and Hamnuna, the
 <span class="lock"><em>old</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_728" id="FNanchor_728">[728]</a></span>
 But what the two “old” ones mean, or who they were, in fact,
he tells us not, for he does not know himself.</p>

<p>Among the venerable sect of the Tanaïm, or rather the Tananim, the
wise men, there were those who taught the secrets practically and initiated
some disciples into the grand and final Mystery. But the <cite>Mishna Hagiga</cite>,
<abbr title="second">2d</abbr> section, say that the table of contents of the <cite>Mercaba</cite> “must
only be delivered to wise old
 <span class="lock">ones.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_729" id="FNanchor_729">[729]</a></span>
 The <cite>Gemara</cite> is still more dogmatic.
“The more important secrets of the Mysteries were not even
revealed to all priests. Alone the initiates had them divulged.” And so
we find the same great secresy prevalent in every ancient religion.</p>

<p>But, as we see, neither the <cite>Sohar</cite> nor any other kabalistic volume
contains merely Jewish wisdom. The doctrine itself being the result of
whole millenniums of thought, is therefore the joint property of adepts of
every nation under the sun. Nevertheless, the <cite>Sohar</cite> teaches practical
occultism more than any other work on that subject; not as it is translated
though, and commented upon by its various critics, but with the
secret signs on its margins. These signs contain the hidden instructions,
apart from the metaphysical interpretations and apparent absurdities so
fully credited by Josephus, who was never initiated, and gave out the
<em>dead letter</em> as he had received
 <span class="lock">it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_730" id="FNanchor_730">[730]</a></span></p>

<p>The real practical magic contained in the <cite>Sohar</cite> and other kabalistic
works, is only of use to those who read it <em>within</em>. The Christian apostles—at

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>

least, those who are said to have produced “miracles” <em>at</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>will</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_731" id="FNanchor_731">[731]</a></span>—had
to be acquainted with this science. It ill-behooves a Christian to
look with horror or derision upon “magic” gems, amulets, and other
talismans against the “evil eye,” which serve as charms to exercise a
mysterious influence, either on the possessor, or the person whom the
magician desires to control. There are still extant a number of such
charmed amulets in public and private collections of antiquities. Illustrations
of convex gems, with mysterious legends—the meaning of which
baffles all scientific inquiry—are given by many collectors. King shows
several such in his <cite>Gnostics</cite>, and he describes a white carnelian (chalcedony),
covered on both sides with interminable legends, to interpret
which would ever prove a failure; yes, in every case, perhaps, but that
of a Hermetic student or an adept. But we refer the reader to his interesting
work, and the talismans described in his plates, to show that even
the “Seer of Patmos” himself was well-versed in this kabalistic science
of talismans and gems. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John clearly alludes to the potent “white
carnelian”—a gem well-known among adepts, as the “<i>alba petra</i>,” or the
stone of initiation, on which the word “<i>prize</i>” is generally found engraved,
as it was given to the candidate who had successfully passed
through all the preliminary trials of a neophyte. The fact is, that no
less than the <cite>Book of Job</cite>, the whole <cite>Revelation</cite>, is simply an allegorical
narrative of the Mysteries and initiation therein of a candidate, who is
John himself. No high Mason, well versed in the different degrees, can
fail to see it. The numbers <em>seven</em>, <em>twelve</em>, and others are all so many
lights thrown over the obscurity of the work. Paracelsus maintained the
same some centuries ago. And when we find the “one like unto the Son
of man” saying (<abbr title="chapter two">chap. ii.</abbr> 17): “<em>To him that overcometh</em>, will I give to
eat of the <em>hidden manna</em>, and will give him a <span class="allsmcap">WHITE STONE</span>, and in the
stone a new name written”—the word—which <em>no man knoweth</em> saving <em>he
that receiveth it</em>, what Master Mason can doubt but it refers to the last
head-line of this chapter?</p>

<p>In the pre-Christian Mithraïc Mysteries, the candidate who fearlessly
overcame the “<em>twelve</em> Tortures,” which preceded the final initiation,
received a small round cake or wafer of unleavened bread, symbolizing,
<em>in one of its meanings</em>, the solar disk and known as the heavenly bread
or “manna,” and having figures traced on it. A <em>lamb</em>, or a <em>bull</em> was
killed, and with the blood the candidate had to be sprinkled, as in the
case of the Emperor Julian’s initiation. The <em>seven</em> rules or mysteries

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>

were then delivered to the “newly-born” that are represented in the
<cite>Revelation</cite> as the seven seals which are opened “in order” (see chap.
<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> and <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr>). There can be no doubt that the Seer of Patmos referred to
this ceremony.</p>

<p>The origin of the Roman Catholic amulets and “relics” blessed by the
Pope, is the same as that of the “Ephesian Spell,” or magical characters
engraved either on a stone or drawn on a piece of parchment; the Jewish
amulets with verses out of the Law, and called <i>phylacteria</i>, φυλακτηρια
and the Mahometan charms with verses of the <cite>Koran</cite>. All these were
used as protective magic spells; and worn by the believers on their
persons. Epiphanius, the worthy ex-Marcosian, who speaks of these
charms when used by the Manicheans as amulets, that is to say, things
worn round the neck (Periapta), and “incantations and <em>such-like trickery</em>,”
cannot well throw a slur upon the “<em>trickery</em>” of the Pagans and
Gnostics, without including the Roman Catholic and Popish amulets.</p>

<p>But consistency is a virtue which we fear is losing, under Jesuit influence,
the slight hold it may ever have had on the Church. That crafty,
learned, conscienceless, terrible soul of Jesuitism, within the body of Romanism,
is slowly but surely possessing itself of the whole prestige and
spiritual power that clings to it. For the better exemplification of our
theme it will be necessary to contrast the moral principles of the ancient
Tanaïm and Theurgists with those professed by the modern Jesuits, who
practically control Romanism to-day, and are the hidden enemy that
would-be reformers must encounter and overcome. Throughout the whole
of antiquity, where, in what land, can we find anything like this Order or
anything even approaching it? We owe a place to the Jesuits in this
chapter on secret societies, for more than any other they are a secret
body, and have a far closer connection with actual Masonry—in France
and Germany at least—than people are generally aware of. The cry of
an outraged public morality was raised against this Order from its very
 <span class="lock">birth.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_732" id="FNanchor_732">[732]</a></span>
 Barely fifteen years had elapsed after the bull approving its constitution
was promulgated, when its members began to be driven away from
one place to the other. Portugal and the Low Countries got rid of them,
in 1578; France in 1594; Venice in 1606; Naples in 1622. From <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Petersburg they were expelled in 1815, and from all Russia in 1820.</p>

<p>It was a promising child from its very teens. What it grew up to be
every one knows well. The Jesuits have done more moral harm in this
world than all the fiendish armies of the mythical Satan. Whatever extravagance
may seem to be involved in this remark, will disappear when

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>

our readers in America, who now know little about them, are made acquainted
with their principles (principio) and rules as they appear in
various works written by the Jesuits themselves. We beg leave to remind
the public that every one of the statements which follow in quotation
marks are extracted from authenticated manuscripts, or folios printed
by this distinguished body. Many are copied from the large
 <span class="lock">Quarto<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_733" id="FNanchor_733">[733]</a></span>
published by the authority of, and verified and collated by the Commissioners
of the French Parliament. The statements therein were collected
and presented to the King, in order that, as the <span lang="fr">“Arrest du Parlement du
5 Mars, 1762,”</span> expresses it, “the elder son of the Church might be made
aware of the perversity of this doctrine.... A doctrine authorizing
Theft, Lying, Perjury, Impurity, every Passion and Crime, teaching
Homicide, Parricide, and Regicide, overthrowing religion in order to
substitute for it superstition, by favoring <em>Sorcery</em>, Blasphemy, Irreligion,
and Idolatry ... etc.” Let us then examine the ideas on <em>magic</em> of
the Jesuits. Writing on this subject in his secret instructions, Anthony
 <span class="lock">Escobar<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_734" id="FNanchor_734">[734]</a></span>
 says:</p>

<p>“It is lawful ... to make use of the science acquired <em>through the
assistance of the Devil</em>, provided the preservation and use of that knowledge
do not depend upon the Devil, <em>for the knowledge is good in itself,
and the sin by which it was acquired has gone</em>
 <span class="lock"><i>by</i>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_735" id="FNanchor_735">[735]</a></span>
 Hence,
why should not a Jesuit cheat the Devil as well as he cheats every
layman?</p>

<p>“<cite>Astrologers and soothsayers are either bound, or are not bound, to
restore the reward of their divination, if the event does not come to pass.</cite>
I own,” remarks the <em>good</em> Father Escobar, “that the former opinion
does not at all please me, because, when the astrologer or diviner has
exerted all the diligence <em>in the diabolic art</em> which is essential to his purpose,
he has fulfilled his duty, whatever may be the result. As the physician
... is not bound to restore his fee ... if his patient should
die; so neither is the astrologer bound to restore his charge ... except

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>

where he has used no effort, or was ignorant of his diabolic art;
because, when he has used his endeavors he has not
 <span class="lock">deceived.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_736" id="FNanchor_736">[736]</a></span></p>

<p>Further, we find the following on astrology: “If any one affirms,
through conjecture founded upon the influence of the stars and the
character, disposition of a man, that he will be a soldier, an ecclesiastic,
or a bishop, <em>this divination may be devoid of all sin</em>; because the stars
and the disposition of the man may have the power of inclining the human
will to a certain lot or rank, but not of constraining
 <span class="lock">it.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_737" id="FNanchor_737">[737]</a></span></p>

<p>Busembaum and Lacroix, in <cite>Theologia</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Moralis</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_738" id="FNanchor_738">[738]</a></span>
 say, “Palmistry
may be considered lawful, if from the lines and divisions of the hands it
can ascertain the disposition of the body, and conjecture, with probability,
the propensities and affections of the
 <span class="lock">soul.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_739" id="FNanchor_739">[739]</a></span></p>

<p>This noble fraternity, which many preachers have of late so vehemently
denied to have ever been a <em>secret</em> one, has been sufficiently proved
as such. Their constitutions were translated into Latin by the Jesuit
Polancus, and printed in the college of the Society at Rome, in 1558.
“They were jealously kept secret, the greater part of the Jesuits themselves
knowing only extracts from
 <span class="lock">them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_740" id="FNanchor_740">[740]</a></span>
 <em>They were never produced to
the light until 1761, when they were published by order of the French
Parliament</em> in 1761, 1762, in the famous process of Father Lavalette.”
The degrees of the Order are: <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> Novices; <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> Lay Brothers, or temporal
Coadjutors; <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> Scholastics; <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> Spiritual Coadjutors; <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> Professed
of Three Vows; <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> Professed of Five Vows. “There is also a
secret class, known only to the General and a few faithful Jesuits, which,
perhaps more than any other, contributed to the dreaded and mysterious
power of the Order,” says Niccolini. The Jesuits reckon it among the
greatest achievements of their Order that Loyola supported, by a special
memorial to the Pope, a petition for the reörganization of that abominable
and abhorred instrument of wholesale butchery—the infamous tribunal
of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>This Order of Jesuits is now all-powerful in Rome. They have been
reinstalled in the Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, in
the Department of the Secretary of State, and in the Ministry of Foreign

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>

Affairs. The Pontifical Government was for years previous to Victor
Emanuel’s occupation of Rome entirely in their hands. The Society
now numbers 8,584 members. But we must see what are their chief
rules. By what is seen above, in becoming acquainted with their mode
of action, we may ascertain what the whole Catholic body is likely to be.
Says Mackenzie: “The Order has secret signs and passwords, according
to the degrees to which the members belong, and as they wear no
particular dress, it is very difficult to recognize them, unless they reveal
themselves as members of the Order; for they may appear as Protestants
or Catholics, democrats or aristocrats, infidels or bigots, according to
the special mission with which they are entrusted. Their spies are everywhere,
of all apparent ranks of society, and they may appear learned and
wise, or simple or foolish, as their instructions run. There are Jesuits of
both sexes, and all ages, and it is a well-known fact that members of the
Order, of high family and delicate nurture, are acting as menial servants
in Protestant families, and doing other things of a similar nature in aid of
the Society’s purposes. We cannot be too much on our guard, for the
whole Society, being founded on a law of unhesitating obedience, can
bring its force on any given point with unerring and fatal
 <span class="lock">accuracy.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_741" id="FNanchor_741">[741]</a></span></p>

<p>The Jesuits maintain that “the Society of Jesus is not of human invention,
<em>but it proceeded from him whose name it bears</em>. For Jesus himself
described that rule of life which the Society follows, <em>first by his example</em>,
and afterwards by his
 <span class="lock">words.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_742" id="FNanchor_742">[742]</a></span></p>

<p>Let, then, all pious Christians listen and acquaint themselves with this
alleged “rule of life” and precepts of their God, as exemplified by the
Jesuits. Peter Alagona (<cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomæ Aquinatis Summæ Theologiæ Compendium</cite>)
says: “By the command of God it is lawful to kill an innocent
person, to steal, or commit ... (<i lang="la">Ex mandato Dei licet occidere innocentem,
furari, fornicari</i>); because he is the Lord of life and death, and
all things, <em>and it is due to him thus to fulfil his command</em>” (<span lang="la">Ex primâ
secundæ, <abbr title="Quæestiones">Quæst.</abbr></span>, 94).</p>

<p>“A man of a religious order, who for a short time lays aside his habit
<em>for a sinful purpose</em>, is free from heinous sin, and does not incur the
penalty of excommunication” (<abbr title="Liber three, section">Lib. iii., sec.</abbr> 2., <abbr title="Problem">Probl.</abbr> 44,
 <span class="lock"><abbr title="number">n.</abbr> 212).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_743" id="FNanchor_743">[743]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>

John Baptist Taberna (<cite>Synopsis Theologiæ Practicæ</cite>), propounds the
following question: “Is a judge bound to restore the bribe which he has
received for passing sentence?” <em>Answer: “If he has received the bribe
for passing an unjust sentence, it is probable that he may keep it....
This opinion is maintained and defended by fifty-eight</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>doctors”</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_744" id="FNanchor_744">[744]</a></span>
 (Jesuits).</p>

<p>We must abstain at present from proceeding further. So disgustingly
licentious, hypocritical, and demoralizing are nearly all of these precepts,
that it was found impossible to put many of them in print, except in the
Latin
 <span class="lock">language.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_745" id="FNanchor_745">[745]</a></span>
 We will return to some of the more decent as we proceed,
for the sake of comparison. But what are we to think of the
future of the Catholic world, if it is to be controlled in word and deed by
this villainous society? And that it is to be so, we can hardly doubt, as
we find the Cardinal Archbishop of Cambrai loudly proclaiming the same
to all the faithful? His pastoral has made a certain noise in France;
and yet, as two centuries have rolled away since the <i lang="fr">exposé</i> of these infamous
principles, the Jesuits have had ample time to lie so successfully
in denying the just charges, that most Catholics will never believe such
a thing. The <em>infallible</em> Pope, Clement <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> (Ganganelli), suppressed
them on the 23d of July, 1773, and yet they came to life again; and
another equally infallible Pope, Pius <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr>, reëstablished them on the 7th
of August, 1814.</p>

<p>But we will hear what Monseigneur of Cambrai is swift to proclaim
in 1876. We quote from a secular paper:</p>

<p>“Among other things, he maintains that <em>Clericalism, Ultramontanism,
and Jesuitism are one and the same thing—that is to say, Catholicism</em>—and
that the distinctions between them have been created by the enemies
of religion. There was a time, he says, when a certain theological
opinion was commonly professed in France concerning the authority of
the Pope. It was restricted to our nation, and was of recent origin. The
civil power during a century and a half imposed official instruction.
Those who profess these opinions were called Gallicans, and those who
protested were called Ultramontanes, because they had their doctrinal
centre beyond the Alps, at Rome. To-day the distinction between the
two schools is no longer admissible. Theological Gallicanism can no
longer exist, since this opinion has ceased to be tolerated by the Church.
<em>It has been solemnly condemned, past all return, by the Œcumenical Council
of the Vatican. One cannot now be Catholic without being Ultramontane—and</em>
<span class="lock"><em>Jesuit.</em>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_746" id="FNanchor_746">[746]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>

This settles the question. We leave inferences for the present, and
proceed to compare some of the practices and precepts of the Jesuits,
with those of individual mystics and organized castes and societies of
the ancient time. Thus the fair-minded reader may be placed in a position
to judge between them as to the tendency of their doctrines to benefit
or degrade humanity.</p>

<p>Rabbi Jehoshua Ben Chananea, who died about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 72, openly
declared that he had performed “miracles” by means of the <cite>Book of
Sepher Jezireh</cite>, and challenged every
 <span class="lock">skeptic.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_747" id="FNanchor_747">[747]</a></span>
 Franck, quoting from the
Babylonian <cite>Talmud</cite>, names two other thaumaturgists, Rabbis Chanina
and <span class="lock">Oshoi.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_748" id="FNanchor_748">[748]</a></span></p>

<p>Simon Magus was doubtless a pupil of the Tanaïm of Samaria, the
reputation which he left behind, together with the title given to him of
“the Great Power of God,” testifies strongly in favor of the ability of
his teachers. The calumnies so zealously disseminated against him by
the unknown authors and compilers of the <cite>Acts</cite> and other writings,
could not cripple the truth to such an extent as to conceal the fact that
no Christian could rival him in thaumaturgic deeds. The story told
about his falling during an aërial flight, breaking both his legs, and then
committing suicide, is ridiculous. Instead of praying mentally that it
should so happen, why did not the apostles pray rather that they should
be allowed to outdo Simon in wonders and miracles, for then they might
have proved their case far more easily than they did, and so converted
thousands to Christianity. Posterity has heard but one side of the story.
Were the disciples of Simon to have a chance, we might find, perhaps,
that it was Peter who broke both his legs, had we not known that this
apostle was too prudent ever to venture himself in Rome. On the confession
of several ecclesiastical writers, no apostle ever performed such
“supernatural wonders.” Of course pious people will say this only
the more proves that it was the “Devil” who worked through Simon.</p>

<p>Simon was accused of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, because
he introduced it as the “Holy Spiritus, the <i>Mens</i> (Intelligence), or the
mother of all.” But we find the same expression used in the <cite>Book of
Enoch</cite>, in which, in contradistinction to the “Son of Man,” he says
“Son of the Woman.” In the <cite>Codex</cite> of the Nazarenes, and in the
<cite>Sohar</cite>, as well in the <cite>Books of Hermes</cite>, the expression is usual; and
even in the apocryphal <cite>Evangelium</cite> of the Hebrews we read that Jesus
himself admitted the sex of the Holy Ghost by using the expression,
“<cite>My mother, the Holy Pneuma</cite>.”</p>

<p>But what is the heresy of Simon, or what the blasphemies of all the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>

heretics, in comparison with that of the same Jesuits who have now so
completely mastered the Pope, ecclesiastical Rome, and the entire Catholic
world? Listen again to their profession of faith.</p>

<p>“Do what your conscience tells you to be good and commanded:
if, through invincible error, you believe lying or blasphemy to be commanded
by God,
<span class="lock"><em>blaspheme</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_749" id="FNanchor_749">[749]</a></span></p>

<p>“Omit to do what your conscience tells you is forbidden: omit the
worship of God, if you invincibly believe it to be prohibited by
<span class="lock">God.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_750" id="FNanchor_750">[750]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is an implied law ... obey an invincibly erroneous dictate
of conscience. As often as you believe invincibly that a lie is
 <span class="lock">commanded—<em>lie</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_751" id="FNanchor_751">[751]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us suppose a Catholic to believe invincibly that the worship of
images is forbidden: in such a case our Lord Jesus Christ will be obliged
to say to him, “<cite>Depart from me thou cursed ... because thou hast worshipped
mine image</cite>.” So, neither, is there any absurdity in supposing
that Christ may say, “<cite>Come thou blessed ... because thou hast lied,
believing invincibly, that in such a case I commanded the</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>lie</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_752" id="FNanchor_752">[752]</a></span></p>

<p>Does not this—but no! words fail to do justice to the emotions that
these astonishing precepts must awaken in the breast of every honest
person. Let silence, resulting from <em>invincible</em> disgust, be our only adequate
tribute to such unparalleled moral obliquity.</p>

<p>The popular feeling in Venice (1606), when the Jesuits were driven
out from that city, expressed itself most forcibly. Great crowds had
accompanied the exiles to the sea-shore, and the farewell cry which
resounded after them over the waves, was, “<i lang="it">Ande in malora!</i>” (Get
away! and woe be to you.) “That cry was echoed throughout the two
following centuries;” says Michelet, who gives this statement, “in
Bohemia in 1618 ... in India in 1623 ... and throughout all Christendom
in 1773.”</p>

<p>In what particular was then Simon Magus a blasphemer, if he only
did that which his conscience invincibly told him was true? And in
what particular were ever the “Heretics,” or even <em>infidels</em> of the worst
kind more reprehensible than the Jesuits—those of
 <span class="lock">Caen,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_753" id="FNanchor_753">[753]</a></span>
 for instance—who
say the following:</p>

<p>“The Christian religion is ... <em>evidently</em> credible, but not <em>evidently
true</em>. It is evidently credible; for it is evident that whoever embraces

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>

it is prudent. <em>It is not evidently true</em>; for it either teaches obscurely, or
the things which it teaches are obscure. And they who affirm that the
Christian religion is evidently true, are obliged to confess that it is evidently
false.”</p>

<p>“Infer from hence—</p>

<p>“1. That it is <em>not</em> evident that there is now any true religion in the
world.</p>

<p>“2. That it is <em>not</em> evident that of all religions existing upon the
earth, the Christian religion is the most true; for have you travelled over
all countries of the world, or do you know that others have?...</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“4. That it is <em>not</em> evident that the predictions of the prophets were
given by inspiration of God; for what refutation will you bring against
me, if I deny that they were true prophecies, or assert that they were
only conjectures?</p>

<p>“5. That it is <em>not</em> evident that the miracles were real, which are recorded
to have been wrought by Christ; although no one can prudently
deny them (Position 6).</p>

<p>“Neither is an avowed belief in Jesus Christ, in the Trinity, in all
the articles of Faith, and in the Decalogue, necessary to Christians. The
only explicit belief which was necessary to the former (Jews) and is
necessary to the latter (Christians) is 1, of God; 2, of a rewarding
God” (Position 8).</p>

<p>Hence, it is also more than “evident” that there are moments in
the life of the greatest liar when he may utter some truths. It is in this
case so perfectly exemplified by the “good Fathers,” that we can see
more clearly than ever whence proceeded the solemn condemnations at
the Œcumenical Council of 1870, of certain “heresies,” and the enforcement
of other articles of faith in which none believed less than those who
inspired the Pope to issue them. History has yet perhaps to learn that
the octogenarian Pope, intoxicated with the fumes of his newly-enforced
infallibility, was but the faithful echo of the Jesuits. “An old man is
raised trembling upon the <i lang="fr">pavois</i> of the Vatican;” says Michelet, “every
thing becomes absorbed and confined in him.... For fifteen centuries
Christendom had submitted to the spiritual yoke of the Church.... But
that yoke was not sufficient for them; they wanted the whole world to
bend under the hand of one master. Here my own words are too weak;
I shall borrow those of others. They (the Jesuits) wanted (this is the
accusation flung in their faces by the Bishop of Paris in the full Council
of Trent) <cite lang="fr">faire de l’épouse de Jesus Christ une prostituée aux volontés d’un</cite>
<span class="lock"><cite lang="fr">homme</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_754" id="FNanchor_754">[754]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>

They have succeeded. The Church is henceforth an inert tool, and
the Pope a poor weak instrument in the hands of this Order. But for
how long? Until the end comes, well may sincere Christians remember
the prophetic lamentations of the thrice-great Trismegistus over his own
country: “Alas, alas, my son, a day will come when the sacred hieroglyphics
will become but idols. <em>The world will mistake the emblems of
science for gods</em>, and accuse grand Egypt of having worshipped hell-monsters.
But those who will calumniate us thus, will themselves worship
Death instead of Life, folly in place of wisdom; they will denounce
love and fecundity, fill their temples with dead men’s bones, as relics,
and waste their youth in solitude and tears. Their <em>virgins will be widows
(nuns) before being wives</em>, and consume themselves in grief; because
men will have despised and profaned the sacred mysteries of
 <span class="lock">Isis.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_755" id="FNanchor_755">[755]</a></span></p>

<p>How correct this prophecy has proved we find in the following Jesuit
precept, which again we extract from the Report of the Commissioners
to the Parliament of Paris:</p>

<p>“The more true opinion is, <em>that all inanimate and irrational things
may be legitimately worshipped</em>,” says Father Gabriel Vasquez, treating of
Idolatry. “If the doctrine which we have established be rightly understood,
not only may a painted image and every holy thing, set forth by
public authority for the worship of God, be properly adored with God as
the image of Himself, but also any other thing of this world, whether it
be inanimate and irrational, or in its nature
 <span class="lock">rational.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_756" id="FNanchor_756">[756]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why may we not adore and worship with God, apart from danger,
anything whatsoever of this world; for God is in it according to His
essence ... [This is precisely what the Pantheist and Hindu philosophy
maintains.] and preserves it continually by His power; and when
we bow down ourselves before it and impress it with a kiss, we present
ourselves before God, the author of it, with the whole soul, as unto the
prototype of the image [follow instances of relics, etc.].... To this we
may add that, since everything of this world is the work of God, and God
is always abiding and working in it, we may more readily conceive Him
to be in it than a saint in the vesture which belonged to him. And,
therefore, <em>without regarding in any way the dignity of the thing created,
to direct our thoughts to God, while we give to the creature the sign and
mark of submission by a kiss or prostration, is neither vain nor superstitious,
but an act of the purest</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>religion</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_757" id="FNanchor_757">[757]</a></span></p>

<p>A precept this, which, whether or not doing honor to the Christian
Church, may at least be profitably quoted by any Hindu, Japanese, or

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>

other heathen when rebuked for his worship of idols. We purposely
quote it for the benefit of our respected “heathen” friends who will see
these lines.</p>

<p>The prophecy of Hermes is less equivocal than either of the alleged prophecies
of Isaiah, which have furnished a pretext for saying that the gods
of all the nations were demons. Only, facts are stronger, sometimes, than
the strongest faith. All that the Jews learned, they had from older
nations than themselves. The Chaldean Magi were their masters in the
secret doctrine, and it was during the Babylonian captivity that they
learned its metaphysical as well as practical tenets. Pliny mentions
three schools of Magi: one that he shows to have been founded at an
unknown antiquity; the other established by Osthanes and Zoroaster;
the third by Moses and Jambres. And all the knowledge possessed by
these different schools, whether Magian, Egyptian, or Jewish, was derived
from India, or rather from both sides of the Himalayas. Many a lost
secret lies buried under wastes of sand, in the Gobi Desert of Eastern
Turkestan, and the wise men of Khotan have preserved strange traditions
and knowledge of alchemy.</p>

<p>Baron Bunsen shows that the origin of the ancient prayers and hymns
of the Egyptian <cite>Book of the Dead</cite> is <em>anterior</em> to Menes, and belongs,
probably, to the pre-Menite Dynasty of Abydos, between 3100 and 4500
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The learned Egyptologist makes the era of Menes, or National
Empire, as not later than 3059 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and demonstrates that “the system
of Osirian worship and mythology was already
 <span class="lock">formed”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_758" id="FNanchor_758">[758]</a></span>
 before this era
of Menes.</p>

<p>We find in the hymns of this scientifically-established pre-Edenic epoch
(for Bunsen carries us back several centuries <em>beyond</em> the year of the creation
of the world, 4004 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, as fixed by biblical chronology) precise
lessons of morality, identical in substance, and nearly so in form of
expression, with those preached by Jesus in his Sermon on the Mount.
We give the authority of the most eminent Egyptologists and hierologists
for our statement. “The inscriptions of the twelfth Dynasty are filled
with ritualistic formulæ,” says Bunsen. Extracts from the Hermetic
books are found on monuments of the earliest dynasties, and “on those
of the twelfth (dynasty) portions of an <em>earlier</em> ritual are by no means
uncommon.... <em>To feed the</em> hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the
naked, bury the <em>dead</em> ... <em>formed the first duty of a pious man</em>....
The doctrine of the immortality of the soul is as old as this period”
(Tablet, <abbr title="British Museum"><cite>Brit. Mus.</cite></abbr>,
 <span class="lock">562).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_759" id="FNanchor_759">[759]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>

And far older, perhaps. It dates from the time when the soul was an
<em>objective</em> being, hence when it could hardly be denied by <em>itself</em>; when
humanity was a spiritual race and death existed not. Toward the decline
of the cycle of life, the ethereal <em>man-spirit</em> then fell into the sweet slumber
of temporary unconsciousness in one sphere, only to find himself awakening
in the still brighter light of a higher one. But while the spiritual man
is ever striving to ascend higher and higher toward its source of being,
passing through the cycles and spheres of individual life, physical man
had to descend with the great cycle of universal creation until it found
itself clothed with the terrestrial garments. Thenceforth the soul was
too deeply buried under physical clothing to reässert its existence, except
in the cases of those more spiritual natures, which, with every cycle, became
more rare. And yet none of the pre-historical nations ever thought of
denying either the existence or the immortality of the inner man, the real
“self.” Only, we must bear in mind the teachings of the old philosophies:
the spirit alone is immortal—the soul, <i lang="la">per se</i>, is neither eternal nor
divine. When linked too closely with the physical brain of its terrestrial
casket, it gradually becomes a <em>finite</em> mind, a simple animal and sentient
life-principle, the <i>nephesh</i> of the Hebrew
 <span class="lock"><cite>Bible</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_760" id="FNanchor_760">[760]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctrine of man’s <em>triune</em> nature is as clearly defined in the Hermetic
books as it is in Plato’s system, or again in that of the Buddhist
and Brahmanical philosophies. And this is one of the most important
as well as least understood of the doctrines of Hermetic science. The
Egyptian Mysteries, so imperfectly known by the world, and only through

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>

the few brief allusions to them in the <cite>Metamorphosis of Apuleius</cite>, taught
the greatest virtues. They unveiled to the aspirant in the “higher” mysteries
of initiation that which many of our modern Hermetic students vainly
search for in the kabalistic books, and which no obscure teachings of the
Church, under the guidance of the Order of Jesuits, will ever be able to
unveil. To compare, then, the ancient secret societies of the hierophants
with the artificially-produced hallucinations of those few followers of
Loyola, who were, perchance, sincere at the beginning of their career, is
to insult the former. And yet, in justice to them, we are compelled to
do so.</p>

<p>One of the most unconquerable obstacles to initiation, with the Egyptians
as with the Greeks, was any degree of murder. One of the greatest
titles to admission in the Order of Jesuits is a <em>murder</em> in defence of Jesuitism.
“<cite>Children may kill their parents if they compel them to abandon the
Catholic faith.</cite>”</p>

<p>“Christian and Catholic sons,” says Stephen Fagundez, “may accuse
their fathers of the crime of heresy if they wish to turn them from the faith,
although they may know that their parents will be burned with fire, and
put to death for it, as Tolet teaches.... And not only may they refuse
them food ... <em>but they may also justly kill</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>them</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_761" id="FNanchor_761">[761]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well known that Nero, the Emperor, <em>had never dared</em> seek
initiation into the Mysteries on account of the murder of Agrippina!</p>

<p>Under Section <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr> of the <cite>Principles of the Jesuits</cite>, we find on
<cite>Homicide</cite> the following Christian principles inculcated by Father Henry
Henriquez, in <cite>Summæ Theologiæ Moralis</cite>. Tomus 1, Venetiis, 1600
(Ed. Coll. Sion): “If an adulterer, even though he should be an ecclesiastic
... being attacked by the husband, kills his aggressor ... <em>he is not
considered irregular</em>: <i lang="la">non ridetur irregularis</i>
 (<abbr title="Liber Fourteen">Lib. XIV.</abbr>, <i lang="la">de Irregularitatæ</i>,
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 10, <abbr title="Section">§</abbr> 3).</p>

<p>“If a father were obnoxious to the State (being in banishment), and
to the society at large, and there were no other means of averting such
an injury, then I should approve of this” (for a son to kill his father),
says <abbr title="Section Fifteen">Sec. XV.</abbr>, <cite>on Parricide and</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Homicide</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_762" id="FNanchor_762">[762]</a></span></p>

<p>“It will be lawful for an ecclesiastic, or one of the religious order,
<em>to kill a calumniator</em> who threatens to spread atrocious accusations against
himself or his
 <span class="lock">religion,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_763" id="FNanchor_763">[763]</a></span>
 is the rule set forth by the Jesuit Francis
Amicus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">364</a></span>

So far, good. We are informed by the highest authorities what a
man in the Catholic communion may do that the common law and
public morality stamp as criminal, and still continue in the odor of
Jesuitical sanctity. Now suppose we again turn the medal and see what
principles were inculcated by Pagan Egyptian moralists before the world
was blessed with these modern improvements in ethics.</p>

<p>In Egypt every city of importance was separated from its burial
place by a sacred lake. The same ceremony of judgment which the
<cite>Book of the Dead</cite> describes as taking place in the world of Spirit,
took place on earth during the burial of the mummy. Forty-two judges
or assessors assembled on the shore and judged the departed “soul”
according to its actions when in the body, and it was only upon a
unanimous approval of this <i lang="la">post-mortem</i> jury that the boatman, who
represented the Spirit of Death, could convey the justified defunct’s body
to its last resting-place. After that the priests returned within the sacred
precincts and instructed the neophytes upon the probable solemn
drama which was then taking place in the invisible realm whither the soul
had fled. The immortality of the spirit was strongly inculcated by the
 <span class="lock">Al-om-jah.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_764" id="FNanchor_764">[764]</a></span>
 In the <em>Crata Nepoa</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_765" id="FNanchor_765">[765]</a>
 the following is described as the <em>seven</em>
degrees of the initiation.</p>

<p>After a preliminary trial at Thebes, where the neophyte had to pass
through many trials, called the “Twelve Tortures,” he was commanded
to govern his passions and never lose for a moment the idea of his God.
Then as a symbol of the wanderings of the unpurified soul, he had to
ascend several ladders and wander in darkness in a cave with many
doors, all of which were locked. When he had overcome the dreadful
trials, he received the degree of <i>Pastophoris</i>, the second and third
degrees being called the <i>Neocoris</i>, and the <i>Melanephoris</i>. Brought into
a vast subterranean chamber thickly furnished with mummies lying in
state, he was placed in presence of the coffin which contained the
mutilated body of Osiris covered with blood. This was the hall called
“Gates of Death,” and it is most certainly to this mystery that the passages
in the <cite>Book of Job</cite> (<abbr title="thirty-eight">xxxviii.</abbr>
 17) and other portions of the <cite>Bible</cite>
allude when these gates are spoken
 <span class="lock">of.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_766" id="FNanchor_766">[766]</a></span>
 In chapter <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr>, we give the esoteric
interpretation of the “Book of Job,” which is the poem of initiation
<i lang="fr">par excellence</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Have the gates of death been opened to thee?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">365</a></span>

asks the “Lord”—<i>i.e.</i>, the Al-om-jah, the Initiator—of Job, alluding to
this third degree of initiation.</p>

<p>When the neophyte had conquered the terrors of this trial, he was
conducted to the “Hall of Spirits,” to be judged by them. Among the
rules in which he was instructed, he was commanded “<em>never to either
desire or seek revenge; to be always ready to help a brother in danger,
even unto the risk of his own life; to bury every dead body; to honor his
parents above all</em>; respect old age and protect those weaker than himself;
and finally, to ever bear in mind the hour of death, and that of
resurrection, in a new and imperishable
 <span class="lock">body.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_767" id="FNanchor_767">[767]</a></span>
 Purity and chastity
were highly recommended, and <em>adultery threatened with death</em>.</p>

<p>Then the Egyptian neophyte was made a <i>Kristophores</i>. In this
degree the mystery-name of IAO was communicated to him. The fifth
degree was that of <i>Balahala</i>, and he was instructed by Horus, in alchemy,
the “word” being <i>chemia</i>. In the sixth, the priestly dance in the circle
was taught him, in which he was instructed in astronomy, for it represented
the course of the planets. In the seventh degree, he was initiated into
the final Mysteries. After a final probation in a building set apart for it,
the <i>Astronomus</i>, as he was now called, emerged from these sacred apartments
called <i>Manneras</i>, and received a cross—the <i>Tau</i>, which, at
death, had to be laid upon his breast. He was a hierophant.</p>

<p>We have read above the rules of these holy initiates of the <em>Christian</em>
Society of Jesus. Compare them with those enforced upon the Pagan
postulant, and Christian (!) morality with that inculcated in those mysteries
of the Pagans upon which all the thunders of an avenging Deity
are invoked by the Church. Had the latter no mysteries of its own?
Or were they in any wise purer, nobler, or more inciting to a holy,
virtuous life? Let us hear what Niccolini has to say, in his able <cite>History
of the Jesuits</cite>, of the <em>modern</em> mysteries of the Christian
 <span class="lock">cloister.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_768" id="FNanchor_768">[768]</a></span></p>

<p>“In most monasteries, and more particularly in those of the Capuchins
and reformed (reformati), there begins at Christmas a series of
feasts, which continues till Lent. All sorts of games are played, the most
splendid banquets are given, and in the small towns, above all, the refectory
of the convent is the best place of amusement for the greater number
of the inhabitants. At carnivals, two or three very magnificent
entertainments take place; the board so profusely spread that one might

 The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>

sombre silence of the cloister is replaced by a confused sound of merrymaking,
and its gloomy vaults now echo with other songs than those of
the psalmist. A ball enlivens and terminates the feast; and, to render
it still more animated, and perhaps to show <em>how completely their vow of
chastity has eradicated all their carnal appetite</em>, some of the young monks
appear coquettishly dressed in the garb of the fair sex, and begin the
dance, along with others, transformed into gay cavaliers. <em>To describe the
scandalous scene which ensues would be but to disgust my readers.</em> I
will only say that I have myself often been a spectator at such saturnalia.”</p>

<p>The cycle is moving down, and, as it descends, the physical and bestial

Spiritual
 <span class="lock">Self.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_770" id="FNanchor_770">[770]</a></span>
 With what disgust may we not turn from this religious
farce called modern Christianity, to the noble faiths of old!</p>

In the Egyptian <cite>Funeral Ritual</cite> found among the hymns of the <cite>Book
of the Dead</cite>, and which is termed by Bunsen “that precious and mysterious
book,” we read an address of the deceased, in the character of
Horus, detailing all that he has done for his father Osiris. Among other
things the deity says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“30. I have given thee thy <em>Spirit</em>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">31. I have given thee thy <em>Soul</em>.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">32. I have given thee thy force (body),” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In another place the entity, addressed as “Father” by the disembodied
soul, is shown to mean the “spirit” of man; for the verse says:
“I have made my soul come and speak with <em>his Father</em>,” its
 <span class="lock"><em>Spirit</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_771" id="FNanchor_771">[771]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptians regarded their <cite>Ritual</cite> as essentially a Divine inspiration;
in short, as modern Hindus do the <cite>Vedas</cite>, and modern Jews their Mosaic
books. Bunsen and Lepsius show that the term <i>Hermetic</i> means inspired;
for it is Thoth, the Deity itself, that speaks and reveals to
his elect among men the will of God and the arcana of divine things.
Portions of them are expressly stated “to have been written by the very
finger of Thoth himself;” to have been the work and composition of the
great
 <span class="lock">God.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_772" id="FNanchor_772">[772]</a></span>
 “At a later period their Hermetic character is still more
distinctly recognized, and on a coffin of the 26th Dynasty, Horus announces
to the deceased that Thoth himself has brought him the books
of his divine words, or Hermetic
 <span class="lock">writings.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_773" id="FNanchor_773">[773]</a></span></p>

<p>Since we are aware that Moses was an Egyptian priest, or at least
that he was learned in all their <em>wisdom</em>, we need not be astonished that
he should write in <cite>Deuteronomy</cite> (<abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 10),
 “And the <i>Lord</i> delivered unto
me two tables of stones written with the finger of <span class="smcap">God</span>;” or to find in
<cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="thirty-one">xxxi.</abbr>, “And he (the Lord) gave unto Moses ... two tables
of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.”</p>

<p>In the Egyptian notions, as in those of all other faiths founded on
philosophy, man was not merely, as with the Christians, a union of soul
and body; he was a trinity when spirit was added to it. Besides, that
doctrine made him consist of <i>kha</i>—body; <i>khaba</i>—astral form, or shadow;
<i>ka</i>—animal soul or life-principle; <i>ba</i>—the higher soul; and <i>akh</i>—terrestrial
intelligence. They had also a sixth principle named <i>Sah</i>—or mummy;
but the functions of this one commenced only after the death of the
body. After due purification, during which the soul, separated from its
body, continued to revisit the latter in its mummified condition, this

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>

astral soul “became a God,” for it was finally absorbed into “the
Soul of the world.” It became transformed into one of the creative
deities, “the god of
 <span class="lock">Phtah,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_774" id="FNanchor_774">[774]</a></span>
 the Demiurgos, a generic name for the
creators of the world, rendered in the <cite>Bible</cite> as the Elohim. In the
<cite>Ritual</cite> the good or purified <em>soul</em>, “in conjunction with its higher or
<em>uncreated</em> spirit, is more or less the victim of the dark influence of the
dragon Apophis. If it has attained the final knowledge of the heavenly
and the infernal mysteries—the <i>gnosis</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, complete reünion with the
spirit, it will triumph over its enemies; if not the soul could not escape
its <em>second death</em>. It is ‘the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone’
(elements), into which those that are cast undergo a ‘second
 <span class="lock">death’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_775" id="FNanchor_775">[775]</a></span>
(<cite>Apocalypse</cite>). This death is the gradual dissolution of the astral form
into its primal elements, alluded to several times already in the course of
this work. But this awful fate can be avoided by the knowledge of the
“Mysterious Name”—the
 <span class="lock">“Word,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_776" id="FNanchor_776">[776]</a></span>
 say the kabalists.</p>

<p>And what then was the penalty attached to the neglect of it? When
a man leads a naturally pure, virtuous life, there is none whatever; except
a delay in the world of spirits, until he finds himself sufficiently purified
to receive it from his Spiritual “Lord,” one of the mighty Host. But
if otherwise, the “soul,” as a half animal principle, becomes paralyzed,
and grows unconscious of its subjective half—the Lord—and in proportion
to the sensuous development of the brain and nerves, sooner or
later, it finally loses sight of its divine mission on earth. Like the <i>Vourdalak</i>,
or Vampire, of the Servian tale, the brain feeds and lives and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>

grows in strength and power at the expense of its spiritual parent. Then
the already half-unconscious soul, now fully intoxicated by the fumes of
earthly life, becomes senseless, beyond hope of redemption. It is powerless
to discern the splendor of its higher spirit, to hear the warning voice
of its “guardian Angel,” and its “God.” It aims but at the development
and fuller comprehension of natural, earthly life; and thus, can
discover but the mysteries of physical nature. Its grief and fear, hope
and joy, are all closely blended with its terrestrial existence. It ignores
all that cannot be demonstrated by either its organs of action, or sensation.
It begins by becoming virtually dead; it dies at last completely.
It is <em>annihilated</em>. Such a catastrophe may often happen long years before
the final separation of the <em>life</em>-principle from the body. When death
arrives, its iron and clammy grasp finds work with <em>life</em> as usual; but
there is no more a soul to liberate. The whole essence of the latter has
been already absorbed by the vital system of the physical man. Grim
death frees but a spiritual corpse; at best an idiot. Unable either to
soar higher or awaken from lethargy, it is soon dissolved in the elements
of the terrestrial atmosphere.</p>

<p>Seers, righteous men, who had attained to the highest science of the
inner man and the knowledge of truth, have, like Marcus Antoninus, received
instructions “from the gods,” in sleep and otherwise. Helped by
the purer spirits, those that dwell in “regions of eternal bliss,” they have
watched the process and warned mankind repeatedly. Skepticism may
sneer; <em>faith</em>, based on <em>knowledge</em> and spiritual science, believes and
affirms.</p>

<p>Our present cycle is preëminently one of such soul-deaths. We
elbow soulless men and women at every step in life. Neither can we
wonder, in the present state of things, at the gigantic failure of Hegel’s
and Schelling’s last efforts at some metaphysical construction of a system.
When facts, palpable and tangible facts of phenomenal Spiritualism
happen daily and hourly, and yet are denied by the majority of “civilized”
nations, little chance is there for the acceptance of purely abstract
metaphysics by the ever-growing crowd of materialists.</p>

<p>In the book called by Champollion <cite lang="fr">Le Manifestation à la Lumière</cite>,
there is a chapter on the <cite>Ritual</cite> which is full of mysterious dialogues,
with addresses to various “Powers” by the soul. Among these dialogues
there is one which is more than expressive of the potentiality of the
“Word.” The scene is laid in the “Hall of the Two Truths.” The
“Door,” the “Hall of Truth,” and even the various parts of the gate,
address the soul which presents itself for admission. They all forbid it
entrance unless it tells them their mystery, or mystic names. What student
of the Secret Doctrines can fail to recognize in these names an identity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">370</a></span>

of meaning and purpose with those to be met with in the <cite>Vedas</cite>, the
later works of the Brahmans, and the <cite>Kabala</cite>?</p>

<p>Magicians, Kabalists, Mystics, Neo-platonists and Theurgists of
Alexandria, who so surpassed the Christians in their achievements in the
secret science; Brahmans or Samaneans (Shamans) of old; and modern
Brahmans, Buddhists, and Lamaists, have all claimed that a certain
power attaches to these various names, pertaining to one ineffable
Word. We have shown from personal experience how deeply the belief
is rooted to this day in the popular mind all over
 <span class="lock">Russia,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_777" id="FNanchor_777">[777]</a></span>
 that the
Word works “miracles” and is at the bottom of every magical feat.
Kabalists mysteriously connect <em>Faith</em> with it. So did the apostles, basing
their assertions on the words of Jesus, who is made to say: “If
ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ... nothing shall be impossible
unto you,” and Paul, repeating the words of Moses, tells that “the
<span class="allsmcap">WORD</span> is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is, the <em>word
of faith</em>” (<cite>Romans</cite> <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 8). But who, except the initiates, can boast of comprehending
its full significance?</p>

<p>In our days it is as it was in olden times, to believe in the biblical
“miracles” requires <em>faith</em>; but to be enabled to produce them one’s self
demands a knowledge of the esoteric meaning of the “word.” “If
Christ,” say Dr. Farrar and Canon Westcott, “wrought no miracles, then
the <cite>gospels</cite> are untrustworthy.” But even supposing that he did work
them, would that prove that gospels written by others than himself are
any more trustworthy? And if not, to what purpose is the argument?
Besides, such a line of reasoning would warrant the analogy that miracles
performed by other religionists than Christians ought to make <em>their</em>
gospels trustworthy. Does not this imply at least an equality between
the Christian Scriptures and the Buddhist sacred books? For these
equally abound with phenomena of the most astounding character.
Moreover, the Christians have no longer <em>genuine</em> miracles produced
through their priests, for they have <em>lost the Word</em>. But many a Buddhist
Lama or Siamese Talapoin—unless all travellers have conspired to
lie—has been and now is able to duplicate every phenomenon described
in the <cite>New Testament</cite>, and even do more, without any pretence of suspension
of natural law or divine intervention either. In fact, Christianity
proves that it is as dead in faith as it is dead in works, while Buddhism
is full of vitality and supported by practical proofs.</p>

<p>The best argument in favor of the genuineness of Buddhist “miracles”
lies in the fact that Catholic missionaries, instead of denying them
or treating them as simple jugglery—as some Protestant missionaries do

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">371</a></span>

have often found themselves in such straits as to be forced to adopt the
forlorn alternative of laying the whole on the back of the Devil. And
so belittled do the Jesuits feel themselves in the presence of these genuine
servants of God, that with an unparalleled cunning, they concluded
to act in the case of the Talapoins and Buddhists as Mahomet is said to
have acted with the mountain. “And seeing that it would not move
toward him, the Prophet moved himself toward the mountain.” Finding
that they could not catch the Siamese with the birdlime of their
pernicious doctrines in Christian garb, they disguised themselves, and
for centuries appeared among the poor, ignorant people as Talapoins,
until exposed. They have even voted and adopted a resolution
forthwith, which has now all the force of an ancient article of faith.
“Naaman, the Syrian,” say the Jesuits of Caen, “did not dissemble his
faith when he bowed the knee with the king in the house of Rimmon;
<em>neither do the Fathers of the Society of Jesus dissemble, when they adopt
the institute and the habit of the Talapoins of Siam</em>” (<span lang="la">nec dissimulant
Patres S. J. Talapoinorum Siamensium institutum vestemque affectantes</span>.—<cite>Position</cite>
9, 30 <abbr title="January">Jan.</abbr>, 1693).</p>

<p>The potency contained in the <cite>Mantras</cite> and the <cite>Vâch</cite> of the Brahmans
is as much believed in at this day as it was in the early Vedic period.
The “Ineffable Name” of every country and religion relates to that which
the Masons affirm to be the mysterious characters emblematic of the
nine names or attributes by which the Deity was known to the initiates.
The Omnific Word traced by Enoch on the two deltas of purest
gold, on which he engraved two of the mysterious characters, is perhaps
better known to the poor, uneducated “heathen” than to the highly
accomplished Grand High Priests and Grand Z.’s of the Supreme Chapters
of Europe and America. Only why the companions of the Royal
Arch should so bitterly and constantly lament its loss, is more than we
can understand. This word of M. M. is, as they will tell themselves,
entirely composed of consonants. Hence, we doubt whether any of
them could ever have mastered its pronunciation, had it even been
“brought to light from the secret vault,” instead of its several corruptions.
However, it is to the land of Mizraim that the grandson of Ham
is credited with having carried the sacred delta of the Patriarch Enoch.
Therefore, it is in Egypt, and in the East alone that the mysterious
“Word” must be sought.</p>

<p>But now that so many of the most important secrets of Masonry
have been divulged by friend and foe, may we not say, without suspicion
of malice or ill-feeling, that since the sad catastrophe of the Templars,
no “Lodge” in Europe, still less in America, has ever known anything
worth concealing. Reluctant to be misunderstood, we say <em>no</em> Lodge,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">372</a></span>

leaving a few <em>chosen</em> brethren entirely out of question. The frantic
denunciations of the Craft by Catholic and Protestant writers appear
simply ridiculous, as also the affirmation of the Abbé Barruel that everything
“betrays our Freemasons as the descendants of those proscribed
Knights” Templars of 1314. The <cite>Memoirs of Jacobinism</cite> by this
Abbé, an eye-witness to the horrors of the first Revolution, is devoted
in great measure to the Rosicrucians and other Masonic fraternities.
The fact alone that he traces the modern Masons to the Templars, and
points them out as secret assassins, trained to political murder, shows
how little he knew of them, but how ardently he desired, at the same
time, to find in these societies convenient scape-goats for the crimes and
sins of another secret society which, since its existence, has harbored
more than one dangerous political assassin—the Society of Jesus.</p>

<p>The accusations against Masons have been mostly half guess-work,
half-unquenchable malice and predetermined vilification. Nothing conclusive
and certain of a criminal character has been directly proven
against them. Even their abduction of Morgan has remained a matter
of conjecture. The case was used at the time as a political convenience
by huckstering politicians. When an unrecognizable corpse
was found in Niagara River, one of the chiefs of this unscrupulous class,
being informed that the identity was exceedingly questionable, unguardedly
exposed the whole plot by saying: “Well, no matter, <cite>he’s a
good enough Morgan until after the election</cite>!” On the other hand, we
find the Order of the Jesuits not only permitting, in certain cases, but
actually <em>teaching and inciting to “High treason and Regicide.”</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_778" id="FNanchor_778">[778]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>

A series of <cite>Lectures</cite> upon Freemasonry and its dangers, as delivered
in 1862, by James Burton Robertson, Professor of Modern History in the
Dublin University, are lying before us. In them the lecturer quotes profusely
as his authorities the said Abbé (Barruel, a natural enemy of the
Masons, <em>who cannot be caught at the confessional</em>), and Robison, a well-known
apostate-Mason of 1798. As usual with every party, whether
belonging to the Masonic or anti-Masonic side, the traitor from the opposing
camp is welcomed with praise and encouragement, and great care is
taken to whitewash him. However convenient for certain political
reasons the celebrated Committee of the Anti-Masonic Convention of
1830 (<abbr title="United States">U. S.</abbr> of America) may have found it to adopt this most Jesuitical
proposition of Puffendorf that “oaths oblige not when they are absurd
and impertinent,” and that other which teaches that “an oath obliges not
if God does not accept
 <span class="lock">it,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_779" id="FNanchor_779">[779]</a></span>
 yet no truly honest man would accept such
sophistry. We sincerely believe that the better portion of humanity will
ever bear in mind that there exists a moral code of honor far more binding
than an oath, whether on the <cite>Bible</cite>, <cite>Koran</cite>, or <cite>Veda</cite>. The Essenes
never swore on anything at all, but their “ayes” and “nays” were as
good and far better than an oath. Besides, it seems surpassingly strange
to find nations that call themselves Christian instituting customs in civil
and ecclesiastical courts diametrically opposed to the command of their
 <span class="lock">God,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_780" id="FNanchor_780">[780]</a></span>
 who distinctly forbids any swearing at all, “neither by heaven ...

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span>

nor by the earth ... nor by the head.” It seems to us that to maintain
that “an oath obliges not if God does not accept it,” besides being an
absurdity—as no man living, whether he be fallible or infallible, can
learn anything of God’s secret thoughts—is <em>anti-Christian</em> in the full
sense of the
 <span class="lock">word.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_781" id="FNanchor_781">[781]</a></span>
 The argument is brought forward only because it is
convenient and answers the object. Oaths will never be binding till
each man will fully understand that humanity is the highest manifestation
on earth of the Unseen Supreme Deity, and each man an incarnation of
his God; and when the sense of <em>personal</em> responsibility will be so developed
in him that he will consider forswearing the greatest possible insult
to himself, as well as to humanity. No oath is now binding, unless taken
by one who, without any oath at all, would solemnly keep his simple
promise of honor. Therefore, to bring forward as authorities such men
as Barruel or Robison is simply obtaining the public confidence under
false pretenses. It is not the “spirit of <em>Masonic malice</em> whose heart
coins slanders like a mint,” but far more that of the Catholic clergy and
their champions; and a man who would reconcile the two ideas of honor
and perjury, in any case whatever, is not to be trusted himself.</p>

<p>Loud is the claim of the nineteenth century to preëminence in civilization
over the ancients, and still more clamorous that of the churches
and their sycophants that Christianity has redeemed the world from barbarism
and idolatry. How little both are warranted, we have tried to
prove in these two volumes. The light of Christianity has only served to
show how much more hypocrisy and vice its teachings have begotten in
the world since its advent, and how immensely superior were the ancients
over us in every point of
 <span class="lock">honor.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_782" id="FNanchor_782">[782]</a></span>
 The clergy, by teaching the helplessness
of man, his utter dependence on Providence, and the doctrine of atonement,
have crushed in their faithful followers every atom of self-reliance
and self-respect. So true is this, that it is becoming an axiom that the
most honorable men are to be found among atheists and the so-called
“infidels.” We hear from Hipparchus that in the days of <em>heathenism</em>
“the shame and disgrace that justly attended the violation of his oath
threw the poor wretch into a fit of madness and despair, so that he cut his
throat and perished by his own hands, and his memory was so abhorred
after his death that his body lay upon the shore of the island of Samos,
and had no other burial than the sands of the
 <span class="lock">sea.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_783" id="FNanchor_783">[783]</a></span>
 But in our own

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>

century we find ninety-six delegates to the United States Anti-Masonic
Convention, every one doubtless a member of some Protestant Church,
and claiming the respect due to men of honor and gentlemen, offering the
most Jesuitical arguments against the validity of a Masonic oath. The
Committee, pretending to quote the authority of “the most distinguished
guides in the philosophy of morals, and claiming the most ample support
of <em>the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>inspired</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_784" id="FNanchor_784">[784]</a></span>
 ... who wrote before Freemasonry existed,”
resolved that, as an oath was “a transaction between man on one part
and the Almighty Judge on the other,” and the Masons were all infidels
and “unfit for civil trust,” therefore their oaths had to be considered
illegal and not
 <span class="lock">binding.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_785" id="FNanchor_785">[785]</a></span></p>

<p>But we will return to these <cite>Lectures</cite> of Robertson and his charges
against Masonry. The greatest accusation brought against the latter is
that Masons reject a <em>personal</em> God (this on the authority of Barruel and
Robison), and that they claim to be in possession of a “secret to make
men better and happier than Christ, his apostles and his Church have made
them.” Were the latter accusation but half true, it might yet allow the
consoling hope that they had really found that secret by breaking off entirely
from the mythical Christ of the Church and the official Jehovah.
But both the accusations are simply as malicious as they are absurd and
untrue; as we shall presently see.</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that we are influenced by personal feeling in
any of our reflections upon Masonry. So far from this being the case
we unhesitatingly proclaim our highest respect for the original purposes
of the Order and some of our most valued friends are within its membership.
We say naught against Masonry as it should be, but denounce it
as, thanks to the intriguing clergy, both Catholic and Protestant, it now
begins to be. Professedly the most absolute of democracies, it is practically
the appanage of aristocracy, wealth, and personal ambition. Professedly
the teacher of true ethics, it is debased into a propaganda of
anthropomorphic theology. The half-naked apprentice, brought before
the master during the initiation of the first degree, is taught that at the
door of the lodge every social distinction is laid aside, and the poorest
brother is the peer of every other, though a reigning sovereign or an imperial
prince. In practice, the Craft turns lickspittle in every monarchical
country, to any regal scion who may deign, for the sake of using it as
a political tool, to put on the once symbolical lambskin.</p>

<p>How far gone is the Masonic Fraternity in this direction, we can judge

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>

from the words of one of its highest authorities. John Yarker, Junior, of
England; Past Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Greece; Grand
Master of the Rite of Swedenborg; also Grand Master of the Ancient
and Primitive Rite of Masonry, and Heaven only knows what
 <span class="lock">else,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_786" id="FNanchor_786">[786]</a></span>
says that Masonry could lose nothing by “the adoption of a higher (not
pecuniary) standard of membership and morality, with exclusion from the
‘purple’ of all who <em>inculcate frauds, sham, historical degrees, and other
immoral abuses</em>” (page 158). And again, on page 157: “As the Masonic
Fraternity is now governed, the Craft is fast becoming the paradise
of the <i lang="fr">bon vivant</i>; of the ‘charitable’ hypocrite, who forgets the version
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, and decorates his breast with the ‘charity jewel’ (having by
this judicious expenditure obtained the ‘purple’ he metes out judgment
to other brethren of greater ability and morality but less means); the
manufacturer of paltry Masonic tinsel; the rascally merchant who swindles
in hundreds, and even thousands, by appealing to the tender consciences
of those few who do regard their O. B.’s; and the Masonic
‘Emperors’ and other charlatans who make power or money out of the
aristocratic pretensions which they have tacked on to our institution—<i lang="la">ad
captandum vulgus</i>.”</p>

<p>We have no wish to make a pretence of exposing secrets long since
hawked about the world by perjured Masons. Everything vital, whether
in symbolical representations, rites, or passwords, as used in modern Freemasonry,
is known in the Eastern fraternities; though there seems to be
no intercourse or connection between them. If Medea is described by
Ovid as having “arm, breast, and knee made bare, left foot slipshod;”
and Virgil, speaking of Dido, shows this “Queen herself ... now resolute
on death, having one foot bare,
 <span class="lock">etc.,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_787" id="FNanchor_787">[787]</a></span>
 why doubt that there are
in the East <em>real</em> “Patriarchs of the sacred Vedas,” explaining the esotericism
of pure Hindu theology and Brahmanism quite as thoroughly as
European “Patriarchs?”</p>

<p>But, if there are a few Masons who, from study of kabalistic and other
rare works, and coming in personal communication with “Brothers”
from the far-away East, have learned something of <em>esoteric</em> Masonry, it is
not the case with the hundreds of American Lodges. While engaged on
this chapter, we have received most unexpectedly, through the kindness
of a friend, a copy of Mr. Yarker’s volume, from which passages are
quoted above. It is brimful of learning and, what is more, of <em>knowledge</em>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span>

as it seems to us. It is especially valuable at this moment, since it corroborates,
in many particulars, what we have said in this work. Thus,
we read in it the following:</p>

<p>“We think we have sufficiently established the fact of the connection
of Freemasonry with other speculative rites of antiquity, as well as
the antiquity and purity of the old English Templar-Rite of <em>seven
degrees</em>, and the spurious derivation of many of the other rites

<p>Such high Masons need not be told, though Craftsmen in general do,
that the time has come to remodel Masonry, and restore those ancient
landmarks, borrowed from the early sodalities, which the eighteenth century
founders of speculative Freemasonry meant to have incorporated in
the fraternity. There are no longer any secrets left unpublished; the
Order is degenerating into a convenience for selfish men to use, and bad
men to debase.</p>

<p>It is but recently that a majority of the Supreme Councils of the Ancient
and Accepted Rite assembled at Lausanne, justly revolting against such
a blasphemous belief as that in a personal Deity, invested with all human
attributes, pronounced the following words: “Freemasonry proclaims,
as it has proclaimed from its origin, the existence of a <em>creative principle</em>,
under the name of the great Architect of the universe.” Against this, a
small minority has protested, urging that “belief in a <em>creative principle</em>
is not <em>the belief in God, which Freemasonry requires of every candidate</em>
before he can pass its very threshold.”</p>

<p>This confession does not sound like the rejection of a personal God.
Could we have had the slightest doubt upon the subject, it would be
thoroughly dispelled by the words of General Albert
 <span class="lock">Pike,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_789" id="FNanchor_789">[789]</a></span>
 perhaps the
greatest authority of the day, among American Masons, who raises himself
most violently against this innovation. We cannot do better than
quote his words:</p>

<p>“This <i lang="fr">Principe Createur</i> is no new phrase—it is but an old term
revived. <em>Our adversaries, numerous and formidable</em>, will say, and will
have the right to say, that our <i lang="fr">Principe Createur</i> is identical with the
<i lang="fr">Principe Generateur</i> of the Indians and Egyptians, and may fitly be
symbolized as it was symbolized anciently, by the Lingæ.... To
accept this, in lieu of a personal God, is TO ABANDON CHRISTIANITY,
and <em>the worship of Jehovah</em>, and return to wallow in the styes
of Paganism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">378</a></span>

And are those of <em>Jesuitism</em>, then, so much cleaner? “Our adversaries,
numerous and formidable.” That sentence says all. Who these
so formidable enemies are, is useless to inquire. They are the Roman
Catholics, and some of the Reformed Presbyterians. To read what the
two factions respectively write, we may well ask which adversary is the
more afraid of the other. But, what shall it profit any one to organize
against a fraternity that does not even dare to have a belief of its own for
fear of giving offense? And pray, how, if Masonic oaths mean anything,
and Masonic penalties are regarded as more than burlesque, can any
adversaries, numerous or few, feeble or strong, know what goes on inside
the lodge, or penetrate beyond that “brother terrible, or the tiler, who
guards, with a drawn sword, the portals of the lodge?” Is, then, this
“brother terrible” no more formidable than Offenbach’s <i>General Boum</i>,
with his smoking pistol, jingling spurs, and towering <i lang="fr">panache</i>? Of
what use the millions of men that make up this great fraternity, the world
over, if they cannot be so cemented together as to bid defiance to all
adversaries? Can it be that the “mystic tie” is but a rope of sand, and
Masonry but a toy to feed the vanity of a few leaders who rejoice in
ribbons and regalia? Is its authority as false as its antiquity? It
seems so, indeed; and yet, as “even the fleas have smaller fleas to bite
’em,” there are Catholic alarmists, even here, who pretend to fear
Masonry!</p>

<p>And yet, these same Catholics, in all the serenity of their traditional
impudence, publicly threaten America, with its 500,000 Masons, and
34,000,000 Protestants, with a union of Church and State under the
direction of Rome! The danger which threatens the free institutions of
this republic, we are told, will come from “the principles of Protestantism
logically developed.” The present Secretary of the Navy—the <abbr title="Honorable">Hon.</abbr>
R. W. Thompson, of Indiana, having actually dared, in his own free
Protestant country, to publish a book recently on <cite>Papacy and the Civil
Power</cite>, in which his language is as moderate as it is gentlemanly and
fair, a Roman Catholic priest, at Washington, D. C.—the very seat of
Government—denounces him with violence. What is better, a representative
member of the Society of Jesus, Father F. X. Weninger, <abbr title="Doctor of Divinity">D.D.</abbr>,
pours upon his devoted head a vial of wrath that seems to have been
brought direct from the Vatican cellars. “The assertions,” he says,
“which Mr. Thompson makes on the necessary antagonism between the
Catholic Church and free institutions, are characterized by pitiful ignorance
and blind audacity. He is reckless of logic, of history, of common
sense, of charity; and presents himself before the loyal American people
as a narrow-minded bigot. No scholar would venture to repeat the stale
calumnies which have so often been refuted.... In answer to his accusations

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>

against the Church as the enemy of liberty, I tell him that, if ever
this country should become a Catholic country, that is, if Catholics
should ever be in the majority, and <em>have the control of political power</em>,
then he would see the principles of our Constitution carried out to the
fullest extent; he would see that these States would be in very deed
<em>United</em>. He would behold a people living in peace and harmony; joined
in the bonds of one faith, their hearts beating in unison with love of their
fatherland, with charity and forbearance toward all, and respecting the
rights and consciences even of their slanderers.”</p>

<p>In behalf of this “Society of Jesus,” he advises Mr. Thompson to
send his book to the Czar, Alexander <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, and to Frederick William,
Emperor of Germany. He may expect from them, as a token of their
sympathy, the orders of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew and of the Black Eagle. “From clear-minded,
self-thinking, patriotic Americans, he cannot expect anything
but the <em>decoration</em> of their contempt. As long as American hearts <em>will</em>
beat in American bosoms, and the blood of their fathers <i>shall</i> flow in
their veins, such efforts as Thompson’s <em>shall</em> not succeed. True, genuine
Americans will protect the Catholic Church in this country and <em>will
finally join it</em>.” After that, having thus, as he seems to think, left the
corpse of his impious antagonist upon the field, he marches off emptying
the dregs of his exhausted bottle after the following fashion: “We leave
the volume, whose argument we have killed, as a carcass to be devoured
by those Texan buzzards—those stinking birds—we mean that kind of
men who love to feed on corruption, calumnies, and lies, and are attracted
by the stench of them.”</p>

<p>This last sentence is worthy to be added as an appendix to the <cite lang="la">Discorsi
del Somma Pontifice Pio <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr></cite>, by Don Pasquale di Franciscis, immortalized
in the contempt of Mr. Gladstone.—<i lang="fr">Tel maître tel Valet!</i></p>

<p>Moral: This will teach fair-minded, sober, and gentlemanly writers that
even so well-bred an antagonist as Mr. Thompson has shown himself in
his book, cannot hope to escape the only available weapon in the Catholic
armory—Billingsgate. The whole argument of the author shows that
while forcible, he intends to be fair; but he might as well have attacked
with a Tertullianistic violence, for his treatment would not have been
worse. It will doubtless afford him some consolation to be placed in the
same category with schismatic and infidel emperors and kings.</p>

<p>While Americans, including Masons, are now warned to prepare themselves
to join the Holy Apostolic and Roman Catholic Church, we are
glad to know that there are some as loyal and respected as any in Masonry
who support our views. Conspicuous among them is our venerable
friend, Mr. Leon Hyneman, P. M., and a member of the Grand Lodge
of Pennsylvania. For eight or nine years he was editor of the <cite>Masonic</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
<cite>Mirror and Keystone</cite>, and is an author of repute. He assures us personally
that for over thirty years he has combated the design to erect
into a Masonic dogma, belief in a <em>personal</em> God. In his work, <cite>Ancient
York and London Grand Lodges</cite>, he says (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 169): “Masonry, instead of
unfolding professionally with the intellectual advancement of scientific
knowledge and general intelligence, has departed from the original aims
of the fraternity, and is apparently inclining towards a sectarian society.
That is plainly to be seen ... in the persistent determination not to
expunge the sectarian innovations interpolated in the Ritual.... It would
appear that the Masonic fraternity of this country are as indifferent to
ancient landmarks and usages of Masonry, as the Masons of the past
century, under the London Grand Lodge were.” It was this conviction
which prompted him, in 1856, when Jacques Etienne Marconis de Nègre,
Grand Hierophant of the Rite of Memphis, came to America and tendered
him the Grand Mastership of the Rite in the United States, and the
Ancient and Accepted Rite offered him an Honorary <abbr title="thirty-third">33d</abbr>—to refuse
both.</p>

<p>The Temple was the last European secret organization which, as a
body, had in its possession some of the mysteries of the East. True,
there were in the past century (and perhaps still are) isolated “Brothers”
faithfully and secretly working under the direction of Eastern Brotherhoods.
But these, when they did belong to European societies, invariably
joined them for objects unknown to the Fraternity, though at the same
time for the benefit of the latter. It is through them that modern
Masons have all they know of importance; and the similarity now found
between the Speculative Rites of antiquity, the mysteries of the Essenes,
Gnostics, and the Hindus, and the highest and oldest of the Masonic
degrees well prove the fact. If these mysterious brothers became possessed
of the secrets of the societies, they could never reciprocate the
confidence, though in their hands these secrets were safer, perhaps, than
in the keeping of European Masons. When certain of the latter were
found worthy of becoming affiliates of the Orient, they were secretly
instructed and initiated, but the others were none the wiser for that.</p>

<p>No one could ever lay hands on the Rosicrucians, and notwithstanding
the alleged discoveries of “secret chambers,” <em>vellums</em> called “T,”
and of fossil knights with ever-burning lamps, this ancient association
and its true aims are to this day a mystery. Pretended Templars and
sham Rose-Croix, with a few genuine kabalists, were occasionally
burned, and some unlucky Theosophists and alchemists sought and put
to the torture; delusive confessions even were wrung from them by the
most ferocious means, but yet, the true Society remains to-day as it has
ever been, unknown to all, especially to its cruelest enemy—the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>

As to the modern Knights Templar and those Masonic Lodges which
now claim a direct descent from the ancient Templars, their persecution
by the Church was a farce from the beginning. They have not, nor have
they ever had any secrets, dangerous to the Church. Quite the contrary;
for we find J. G. Findel saying that the Scottish degrees, or the Templar
system, only dates from 1735-1740, and “<em>following its Catholic tendency,
took up its chief residence in the Jesuit College of Clermont, in Paris</em>, and
hence was called the Clermont system.” The present Swedish system
has also something of the Templar element in it, but free from Jesuits
and interference with politics; however, it asserts that it has Molay’s
Testament in the original, for a Count Beaujeu, a nephew of Molay,
<em>never heard of elsewhere</em>—says Findel—transplanted Templarism into
Freemasonry, and thus procured for his uncle’s ashes a mysterious
sepulchre. It is sufficient to prove this a Masonic fable that on this pretended
monument the day of Molay’s funeral is represented as March
11, 1313, while the day of his death was March 19, 1313. This spurious
production, which is neither genuine Templarism, nor genuine Freemasonry,
has never taken firm root in Germany. But the case is otherwise
in France.</p>

<p>Writing upon this subject, we must hear what Wilcke has to say of
these pretensions:</p>

<p>“The present Knight Templars of Paris will have it, that they are
direct descendants from the ancient Knights, and endeavor to prove this
by documents, interior regulations, and secret doctrines. Foraisse says
the Fraternity of Freemasons was founded in Egypt, Moses communicating
the secret teaching to the Israelites, Jesus to the Apostles, and
thence it found its way to the Knight Templars. Such inventions are
necessary ... to the assertion that the Parisian Templars are the offspring
of the ancient order. All these asseverations, unsupported by
history, were fabricated <em>in the High Chapter of Clermont</em> (Jesuits), and
preserved by the Parisian Templars as a legacy left them by those political
revolutionists, the Stuarts and the Jesuits.” Hence we find the
Bishops
 <span class="lock">Gregoire<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_790" id="FNanchor_790">[790]</a></span>
 and
 <span class="lock">Münter<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_791" id="FNanchor_791">[791]</a></span>
 supporting them.</p>

<p>Connecting the modern with the ancient Templars, we can at best,
therefore, allow them an adoption of certain rites and ceremonies of
purely <em>ecclesiastical</em> character after they had been cunningly inoculated
into that grand and antique Order by the clergy. Since this desecration,
it gradually lost its primitive and simple character, and went fast to its
final ruin. Founded in 1118 by the Knights Hugh de Payens and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>

Geoffrey de <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer, nominally for the protection of the pilgrims, its
true aim was the restoration of the primitive secret worship. The true
version of the history of Jesus, and the early Christianity was imparted to
Hugh de Payens, by the Grand-Pontiff of the Order of the Temple (of
the Nazarene or Johanite sect), one named Theocletes, after which it
was learned by some Knights in Palestine, from the higher and more
intellectual members of the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John sect, who were initiated into its
 <span class="lock">mysteries.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_792" id="FNanchor_792">[792]</a></span>
 Freedom of intellectual thought and the restoration of
one and universal religion was their secret object. Sworn to the vow
of obedience, poverty, and chastity, they were at first the true Knights
of John the Baptist, crying in the wilderness and living on wild honey
and locusts. Such is the tradition and the true kabalistic version.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to state that the Order became only later anti-Catholic.
It was so from the beginning, and the red cross on the white mantle, the
vestment of the Order, had the same significance as with the initiates
in every other country. It pointed to the four quarters of the compass,
and was the emblem of the
 <span class="lock">universe.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_793" id="FNanchor_793">[793]</a></span>
 When, later, the Brotherhood
was transformed into a Lodge, the Templars had, in order to avoid persecution,
to perform their own ceremonies in the greatest secresy, generally
in the hall of the chapter, more frequently in isolated caves or
country houses built amidst woods, while the ecclesiastical form of worship
was carried on publicly in the chapels belonging to the Order.</p>

<p>Though of the accusations brought against them by order of Philip
<abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>, many were infamously false, the main charges were certainly correct,
from the stand-point of what is considered by the Church, <em>heresy</em>.
The present-day Templars, adhering strictly as they do to the <cite>Bible</cite>, can
hardly claim descent from those who did not believe in Christ, as God-man,
or as the Saviour of the world; who rejected the miracle of his
birth, and those performed by himself; who did not believe in transubstantiation,
the saints, holy relics, purgatory, etc. The Christ Jesus was,
in their opinion, a false prophet, but the man Jesus a Brother. They
regarded John the Baptist as their patron, but never viewed him in the
light in which he is presented in the <cite>Bible</cite>. They reverenced the doctrines

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>

of alchemy, astrology, magic, kabalistic talismans, and adhered to
the secret teachings of their chiefs in the East. “In the last century,”
says Findel, “when Freemasonry erroneously supposed herself the daughter
of Templarism, great pains were taken to regard the Order of Knights-Templars
as innocent.... For this purpose not only legends and unrecorded
events were fabricated, but pains were taken to repress the truth.
The Masonic admirers of the Knights-Templars bought up the whole of
the documents of the lawsuit published by Moldenwaher, because they
proved the culpability of the
 <span class="lock">Order.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_794" id="FNanchor_794">[794]</a></span></p>

<p>This culpability consisted in their “heresy” against the Roman
Catholic Church. While the real “Brothers” died an ignominious death,
the spurious Order which tried to step into their shoes became exclusively
a branch of the Jesuits under the immediate tutelage of the latter.
True-hearted, honest Masons, ought to reject with horror any connection,
let alone descent from these.</p>

<p>“The Knights of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of Jerusalem,” writes Commander
 <span class="lock">Gourdin,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_795" id="FNanchor_795">[795]</a></span>
“sometimes called the Knights Hospitallers, and the Knights of
Malta, were not Freemasons. On the contrary, they seem to have been
inimical to Freemasonry, for in 1740, the Grand Master of the Order of
Malta caused the Bull of Pope Clement <abbr title="Twelve">XII.</abbr> to be published in that
island, and forbade the meetings of the Freemasons. On this occasion
several Knights and many citizens left the island; and in 1741, the
Inquisition persecuted the Freemasons at Malta. The Grand Master
proscribed their assemblies under severe penalties, and six Knights
were banished from the island in perpetuity for having assisted at a
meeting. In fact, unlike the Templars, they had not even a secret form
of reception. Reghellini says that he was unable to procure a copy
of the secret Ritual of the Knights of Malta. The reason is obvious—there
was none!”</p>

<p>And yet American Templarism comprises three degrees. 1, Knight
of the Red Cross; 2, Knight Templar; and 3, Knight of Malta. It
was introduced from France into the United States, in 1808, and the
first <i>Grand Encampment General</i> was organized on June 20, 1816, with
Governor De Witt Clinton, of New York, as Grand Master.</p>

<p>This inheritance of the Jesuits should hardly be boasted of. If the
Knights Templar desire to make good their claims, they must choose
between a descent from the “heretical,” anti-Christian, kabalistic,
primitive Templars, or connect themselves with the Jesuits, and nail

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>

their tesselated carpets directly on the platform of ultra-Catholicism!
Otherwise, their claims become a mere pretense.</p>

<p>So impossible does it become for the originators of the <em>ecclesiastical</em>
pseudo-order of Templars, invented, according to Dupuy, in France, by
the adherents of the Stuarts, to avoid being considered a branch of the
Order of the Jesuits, that we are not surprised to see an anonymous author,
rightly suspected of belonging to the Jesuit Chapter at Clermont, publishing
a work in 1751, in Brussels, on the lawsuit of the Knights Templar.
In this volume, in sundry mutilated notes, additions, and commentaries,
he represents the <em>innocence</em> of the Templars of the accusation
of “heresy,” thus robbing them of the greatest title to respect and admiration
that these early free-thinkers and martyrs have won!</p>

<p>This last pseudo-order was constituted at Paris, on the 4th of November,
1804, by virtue of a <em>forged Constitution</em>, and ever since it has “contaminated
genuine Freemasonry,” as the highest Masons themselves tell
us. <i lang="fr">La Charte de transmission</i> (<span lang="la">tabula aurea Larmenii</span>) presents the
outward appearance of such extreme antiquity “that Gregoire confesses
that if all the other relics of the Parisian treasury of the Order had not
silenced his doubts as to their ancient descent, the sight of this charter
would at the very first glance have persuaded
 <span class="lock">him.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_796" id="FNanchor_796">[796]</a></span>
 The first Grand
Master of this spurious Order was a physician of Paris, Dr. Fahre-Palaprat,
who assumed the name of Bernard Raymond.</p>

<p>Count Ramsay, a Jesuit, was the first to start the idea of the Templars
being joined to the Knights of Malta. Therefore, we read from his pen
the following:</p>

<p>“Our forefathers (!!!), the Crusaders, assembled in the Holy Land
from all Christendom, wished to unite in a fraternity embracing all
nations, that when bound together, heart and soul, for mutual improvement,
they might, in the course of time, represent one single intellectual
people.”</p>

<p>This is why the Templars are made to join the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Knights,
and the latter got into the craft of Masonry known as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s Masons.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Sceau Rompu</cite>, in 1745, we find, therefore, the following most
impudent falsehood, worthy of the Sons of Loyola: “The lodges were
dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, because <em>the Knights</em>-Masons had in the holy wars
in Palestine joined the Knights of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John.”</p>

<p>In 1743, the Kadosh degree was invented at Lyons (so writes Thory,
at least), and “it represents the <em>revenge of the Templars</em>.” And here
we find Findel saying that “the Order of Knights Templars had been
abolished in 1311, and to that epoch they were obliged to have recourse

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>

when, after the banishment of several Knights from Malta, in 1740,
because they were Freemasons, it was no longer possible to keep up a
connection with the Order of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, or Knights of Malta, then in the
plenitude of their power <em>under the sovereignty of the Pope</em>.”</p>

<p>Turning to Clavel, one of the best Masonic authorities, we read:
“It is clear that the erection of the French Order of the Knight Templars
is not more ancient than the year 1804, and that it cannot lay any legitimate
claim to being the continuation of the so-called society of ‘la petite
Resurrection des Templiers,’ nor this latter, either, extend back to the
ancient Order of the Knights Templars.” Therefore, we see these pseudo-Templars,
under the guidance of the worthy Father Jesuits, forging in Paris,
1806, the famous charter of Larmenius. Twenty years later, this nefast
and subterranean body, guiding the hand of assassins, directed it toward
one of the best and greatest princes in Europe, whose mysterious death,
unfortunately for the interests of truth and justice, has never been—for
political reasons—investigated and proclaimed to the world as it ought to
have been. It is this prince, a Freemason himself, who was the last
depository of the secrets of the true Knights Templar. For long centuries
these had remained unknown and unsuspected. Holding their
meetings once every <em>thirteen</em> years, at Malta, and their Grand Master
advising the European brothers of the place of <i lang="fr">rendezvous</i> but a few hours
in advance, these representatives of the once mightiest and most glorious
body of Knights assembled on the fixed day, from various points of the
earth. <em>Thirteen</em> in number, in commemoration of the year of the death
of Jacques Molay (1313), the now Eastern brothers, among whom were
crowned heads, planned together the future religious and political fate of
the nations; while the Popish Knights, their murderous and bastard successors,
slept soundly in their beds, without a dream disturbing their
guilty consciences.</p>

<p>“And yet,” says Rebold, “notwithstanding the confusion they had
created (1736-72), the Jesuits had accomplished but one of their designs,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: <em>denaturalyzing and bringing into disrepute the Masonic Institution</em>.
Having succeeded, as they believed, in destroying it in one form, they
were determined to use it in another. With this determination, they
arranged the systems styled ‘Clerkship of the Templars,’ an amalgamation
of the different histories, events, and characteristics of the crusades mixed
with the reveries of the alchemists. <em>In this combination Catholicism
governed all, and the whole fabrication moved upon wheels, representing
the great object for which the Society of Jesus was</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>organized.</em>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_797" id="FNanchor_797">[797]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence, the rites and symbols of Masonry which though “Pagan” in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>

origin, are all applied to and all flavor of Christianity. A Mason has to
declare his belief in a <em>personal</em> God, Jehovah, and in the Encampment
degrees also in Christ, before he can be accepted in the Lodge, while the
Johanite Templars believed in the unknown and invisible Principle,
whence proceeded the Creative Powers misnamed <em>gods</em>, and held to the
Nazarene version of Ben-Panther being the sinful father of Jesus, who
thus proclaimed himself “the son of god and of
 <span class="lock">humanity.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_798" id="FNanchor_798">[798]</a></span>
 This also
accounts for the fearful oaths of the Masons taken <em>on the Bible</em>, and for
their lectures servilely agreeing with the Patriarcho-Biblical Chronology.
In the American Order of Rose Croix, for instance, when the neophyte
approaches the altar, the “Sir Knights are called to order, and the captain
of the guard makes his proclamation.” “To the glory of the sublime
architect of the universe (Jehovah-Binah?), under the auspices of the
Sovereign Sanctuary of <em>Ancient</em> and <em>Primitive</em> Freemasonry,” etc., etc.
Then the Knight Orator strikes 1 and tells the neophyte that the antique
legends of Masonry date back <span class="allsmcap">FORTY</span> centuries; claiming no greater
antiquity for the oldest of them than 622 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, at which time he says
Noah was born. Under the circumstances this will be regarded as a
liberal concession to chronological preferences. After that
 <span class="lock">Masons<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_799" id="FNanchor_799">[799]</a></span>
 are
apprised that it was about the year 2188 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, that Mizraim led colonies
into Egypt, and laid the foundation of the Kingdom of Egypt, which
kingdom lasted 1,663 years (!!!). Strange chronology, which, if it piously
conforms with that of the <cite>Bible</cite>, disagrees entirely with that of history.
The mythical nine names of the Deity, imported into Egypt, according

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>

to the Masons, only in the twenty-second century <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, are found on
monuments reckoned twice as old by the best Egyptologists. Nevertheless
we must take at the same time into consideration, that the Masons
are themselves ignorant of these names.</p>

<p>The simple truth is that modern Masonry is a sadly different thing
from what the once universal secret fraternity was in the days when the
Brahma-worshippers of the AUM, exchanged grips and passwords with
the devotees of TUM, and the adepts of every country under the sun
were “Brothers.”</p>

<p>What was then that mysterious name, that mighty “word” through
whose potency the Hindu as well as the Chaldean and Egyptian initiate
performed his wonders? In chapter <abbr title="115">cxv.</abbr> of the Egyptian <cite>Funeral
Ritual</cite>, entitled “The chapter of coming out to the Heaven ... and
of knowing the Spirits of An” (Heliopolis), Horus says: “I knew the
Spirits of An. The greatly glorious does not pass over it ... unless
the gods give me the <span class="allsmcap">WORD</span>.” In another hymn the soul, transformed,
exclaims: “Make road for me to Rusta. I am the Great One, dressed as
the Great One. I have come! I have come! Delicious to me are the
kings of Osiris. I am creating the water (through the power of the
<em>Word</em>).... Have I not seen the hidden secrets ... I have given
truth to the Sun. I am clear. I am adored for my purity” (<abbr title="117 to 119">cxvii.-cxix.</abbr>
The chapters of the going into and coming out from the Rusta).
In another place the mummy’s roll expresses the following: “I am the
Great God (spirit) existing of myself, the creator of <em>His Name</em>.... I
know the name of this Great God that is there.”</p>

<p>Jesus is accused by his enemies of having wrought miracles, and
shown by his own apostles to have expelled <em>demons</em> by the power of the
<span class="smcap">Ineffable Name</span>. The former firmly believed that he had stolen it in
the Sanctuary. “And he cast the spirits with his <em>word</em> ... and
healed all that were sick” (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 16). When the Jewish
rulers ask Peter (<cite>Acts</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 7):
 “By what power, or by what <em>name</em>, have
ye done this?” Peter replies, “By the <span class="smcap">Name</span> of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth.” But does this mean the name of Christ, as the interpreters
would make us believe; or does it signify, “by the <span class="smcap">Name</span> which
was in the possession of Jesus of Nazareth,” the initiate, who was accused
by the Jews to have learned it but who had it really through initiation?
Besides, he states repeatedly that all that he does he does in
“<em>His Father’s Name</em>,” not in his own.</p>

<p>But who of the modern Masons has ever heard it pronounced? In
their own <cite>Ritual</cite>, they confess that they never have. The “Sir
Orator” tells the “Sir Knight,” that the passwords which he received
in the preceding degrees are all “so many corruptions” of the true name

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>

of God engraved on the triangle; and that therefore they have adopted a
“substitute” for it. Such also is the case in the Blue Lodge, where the
Master, representing King Solomon, agrees with King Hiram that the
Word * * * “shall be used as a <em>substitute</em> for the Master’s word, until
wiser ages shall discover the true one. What Senior Deacon, of all the
thousands who have assisted in bringing candidates from darkness to
light; or what Master who has whispered this mystic “word” into the
ears of supposititious Hiram Abiffs, while holding them on the five points
of fellowship, has suspected the real meaning of even this substitute,
which they impart “at low breath?” How few new-made Master
Masons but go away imagining that it has some occult connection with
the “marrow in the bone.” What do they know of that mystical personage
known to some adepts as the “venerable <span class="smcap">Mah</span>,” or of the mysterious
Eastern Brothers who obey him, whose name is abbreviated
in the first syllable of the three which compose the Masonic substitute—The
<span class="smcap">Mah</span>, who lives at this very day in a spot unknown to all but
initiates, and the approaches to which are through trackless wildernesses,
untrodden by Jesuit or missionary foot, for it is beset by dangers
fit to appall the most courageous explorers? And yet, for generations
this meaningless jingle of vowels and consonants has been repeated
in noviciate ears, as though it possessed even so much potency
as would deflect from its course a thistle-down floating in the air!
Like Christianity, Freemasonry is a corpse from which the spirit long ago
fled.</p>

<p>In this connection, place may well be given to a letter from Mr.
Charles Sotheran, Corresponding Secretary of the New York Liberal
Club, which was received by us on the day after the date it bears. Mr.
Sotheran is known as a writer and lecturer on antiquarian, mystical, and
other subjects. In Masonry, he has taken so many of the degrees as to
be a competent authority as regards the Craft. He is 32 ∴ A. and P. R.,
94 ∴ Memphis, K. R✠, K. Kadosh, M. M. 104, Eng., etc. He is also
an initiate of the modern English Brotherhood of the Rosie Cross and
other secret societies, and Masonic editor of the <cite>New York Advocate</cite>.
Following is the letter, which we place before the Masons as we desire
that they should see what one of their own number has to say:</p>

<div class="blockquot small">
<p class="right r1">
“<span class="smcap">New York Press Club</span>, January 11th, 1877.<br>
</p>

<p>“In response to your letter, I willingly furnish the information desired with respect
to the antiquity and present condition of Freemasonry. This I do the more cheerfully
since we belong to the same secret societies, and you can thus better appreciate the
necessity for the reserve which at times I shall be obliged to exhibit. You rightly refer
to the fact that Freemasonry, no less than the effete theologies of the day, has its fabulous
history to narrate. Clogged up as the Order has been by the rubbish and drift of
absurd biblical legends, it is no wonder that its usefulness has been impaired and its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>

work as a civilizer hampered. Fortunately the great anti-Masonic excitement that
raged in the United States during a portion of this century, forced a considerable band
of workers to delve into the true origin of the Craft, and bring about a healthier state
of things. The agitation in America also spread to Europe and the literary efforts of
Masonic authors on both sides of the Atlantic, such as Rebold, Findel, Hyneman,
Mitchell, Mackenzie, Hughan, Yarker and others well-known to the fraternity, is now
a matter of history. One effect of their labors has been, in a great measure, to bring
the history of Masonry into an open daylight, where even its teachings, jurisprudence,
and ritual are no longer secret from those of the ‘profane,’ who have the wit to read
as they run.</p>

<p>“You are correct in saying that the <cite>Bible</cite> is the ‘great light’ of European and
American Masonry. In consequence of this the theistic conception of God and the
biblical cosmogony have been ever considered two of its great corner-stones. Its
chronology seems also to have been based upon the same pseudo-revelation. Thus
Dr. Dalcho, in one of his treatises asserts that the principles of the Masonic Order
were presented at and coëval with the creation. It is therefore not astonishing that
such a pundit should go on to state that God was the first Grand Master, Adam the
second, and the last named initiated Eve into the Great Mystery, as I suppose many
a Priestess of Cybelè and ‘Lady’ Kadosh were afterward. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Oliver,
another Masonic authority, gravely records what may be termed the minutes of a
Lodge where Moses presided as Grand Master, Joshua as Deputy Grand Master, and
Aholiab and Bezaleel as Grand Wardens! The temple at Jerusalem, which recent
archæologists have shown to be a structure with nothing like the pretended antiquity
of its erection, and incorrectly called after a monarch whose name proves his mystical
character, Sol-Om-On (the name of the sun in three languages), plays, as you correctly
observe, a considerable share in Masonic mystery. Such fables as these, and the
traditional Masonic colonization of ancient Egypt, have given the Craft the credit of
an illustrious origin to which it has no right, and before whose forty centuries of
legendary history, the mythologies of Greece and Rome fade into insignificance. The
Egyptian, Chaldean, and other theories necessary to each fabricator of ‘high degrees’
have also each had their short period of prominence. The last ‘axe to grind’
has consecutively been the fruitful mother of unproductiveness.</p>

<p>“We both agree that all the ancient priesthoods had their esoteric doctrines and
secret ceremonies. From the Essenic brotherhood, an evolution of the Hindu Gymnosophists,
doubtless proceeded the Solidarities of Greece and Rome as described
by so-called ‘Pagan’ writers. Founded on these and copying them in the matter of
ritual, signs, grips, passwords, etc., were developed the mediæval guilds. Like the present
livery companies of London, the relics of the English trade-guilds, the operative
Masons were but a guild of workmen with higher pretensions. From the French
name ‘Maçon,’ derived from ‘Mas,’ an old Norman noun meaning ‘a house,’ comes
our English ‘Mason,’ a house builder. As the London companies alluded to present
now and again the Freedom of the ‘<em>Liveries</em>’ to outsiders, so we find the trade-guilds
of Masons doing the same. Thus the founder of the Ashmolean Museum was made free
of the Masons at Warrington, in Lancashire, England, on the 16th October, 1646.
The entrance of such men as Elias Ashmole into the Operative Fraternity paved the
way for the great ‘Masonic Revolution of 1717,’ when <span class="smcap">Speculative</span> Masonry came
into existence. The Constitutions of 1723 and 1738, by the Masonic impostor Anderson,
were written up for the newly-fledged and first Grand Lodge of ‘Free and
Accepted Masons’ of England, from which body all others over the world hail to-day.</p>

<p>“These bogus constitutions, written by Anderson, were compiled about then, and in
order to palm off his miserable rubbish yclept history, on the Craft, he had the audacity
to state that nearly all the documents relating to Masonry in England had been
destroyed by the 1717 reformers. Happily, in the British Museum, Bodleian Library,
and other public institutions, Rebold, Hughan and others have discovered sufficient
evidence in the shape of old Operative Masonic charges to disprove this statement.</p>

<p>“The same writers, I think, have conclusively upset the tenability of two other
documents palmed upon Masonry, namely, the spurious charter of Cologne of 1535, and
the forged questions, supposed to have been written by Leylande, the antiquary,
from a MS. of King Henry <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> of England. In the last named, Pythagoras is referred

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>

to as having—‘formed a great lodge, at Crotona, and made many Masons, some
of whom travelled into France, and there made many, from whence, in process of time,
the art passed into England.’ Sir Christopher Wren, architect of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s Cathedral,
London, often called the ‘Grand Master of Freemasons,’ was simply the Master or
President of the London Operative Masons Company. If such a tissue of fable could
interweave itself into the history of the Grand Lodges which now have charge of the
first three symbolical degrees, it is hardly astonishing that the same fate should befall
nearly all of the High Masonic Degrees which have been aptly termed ‘an incoherent
medley of opposite principles.’</p>

<p>“It is curious to note too that most of the bodies which work these, such as the
Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, the Rite of Avignon, the Order of the Temple,
Fessler’s Rite, the ‘Grand Council of the Emperors of the East and West—Sovereign
Prince Masons,’ etc., etc., are nearly all the offspring of the sons of Ignatius Loyola.
The Baron Hundt, Chevalier Ramsay, Tschoudy, Zinnendorf, and numerous others who
founded the grades in these rites, worked under instructions from the General of the
Jesuits. The nest where these high degrees were hatched, and no Masonic rite is free
from their baleful influence more or less, was the Jesuit College of Clermont at Paris.</p>

<p>“That bastard foundling of Freemasonry, the ‘Ancient and Accepted Scottish
Rite,’ which is unrecognized by the Blue Lodges was the enunciation, primarily, of the
brain of the Jesuit Chevalier Ramsay. It was brought by him to England in 1736-38,
to aid the cause of the Catholic Stuarts. The rite in its present form of thirty-three
degrees was reorganized at the end of the eighteenth century by some half dozen Masonic
adventurers at Charleston, South Carolina. Two of these, Pirlet a tailor, and a
dancing master named Lacorne, were fitting predecessors for a later resuscitation by a
gentleman of the name of Gourgas, employed in the aristocratic occupation of a ship’s
clerk, on a boat trading between New York and Liverpool. Dr. Crucefix, <i lang="la">alias</i> Goss,
the <em>inventor</em> of certain patent medicines of an objectionable character, ran the institution
in England. The powers under which these worthies acted was a document
claimed to have been signed by Frederick the Great at Berlin, on May 1st, 1786, and
by which were revised the Masonic Constitution and Status of the High Degrees of the
Ancient and Accepted Rite. This paper was an impudent forgery and necessitated the
issuing of a protocol by the Grand Lodges of the Three Globes of Berlin, which conclusively
proved the whole arrangement to be false in every particular. On claims
supported by this supposititious document, the Ancient and Accepted Rite have swindled
their confiding brothers in the Americas and Europe out of thousands of dollars, to the
shame and discredit of humanity.</p>

<p>“The modern Templars, whom you refer to in your letter, are but mere magpies in
peacock’s plumes. The aim of the Masonic Templars is the sectarianization, or rather
the Christianizing of Masonry, a fraternity which is supposed to admit the Jew, Parsee,
Mahometan, Buddhist, in fact every religionist within its portals who accepts the
doctrine of a personal god, and spirit-immortality. According to the belief of a section,
if not all the Israelites, belonging to the Craft in America—Templarism is Jesuitism.</p>

<p>“It seems strange, now that the belief in a personal God is becoming extinct, and
that even the theologian has transformed his deity into an indescribable nondescript,
that there are those who stand in the way of the general acceptation of the sublime pantheism
of the primeval Orientals, of Jacob Boehme, of Spinoza. Often in the Grand
Lodge and subordinate lodges of this and other jurisdictions, the old doxology is sung,
with its ‘Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,’ to the disgust of Israelites and free-thinking
brethren, who are thus unnecessarily insulted. This could never occur in
India, where the great light in a lodge may be the <cite>Koran</cite>, the <cite>Zend-Avesta</cite>, or one of
the <cite>Vedas</cite>. The sectarian Christian spirit in Masonry must be put down. To-day there
are German Grand Lodges which will not allow Jews to be initiated, or Israelites from
foreign countries to be accepted as brethren within their jurisdiction. The French
Masons have, however, revolted against this tyranny, and the Grand Orient of France
does now permit the atheist and materialist to fellowship in the Craft. A standing
rebuke upon the claimed universality of Masonry is the fact that the French brethren
are now repudiated.</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding its many faults—and speculative Masonry is but human, and
therefore fallible—there is no institution that has done so much, and is yet capable of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>

such great undertakings in the future, for human, religious, and political improvement.
In the last century the Illuminati taught, ‘peace with the cottage, war with the palace,’
throughout the length and breadth of Europe. In the last century the United States
was freed from the tyranny of the mother country by the action of the Secret Societies
more than is commonly imagined. Washington, Lafayette, Franklin, Jefferson, Hamilton,
were Masons. And in the nineteenth century it was Grand Master Garibaldi,
33, who unified Italy, working in accordance with the spirit of the faithful brotherhood,
as the Masonic, or rather carbonari, principles of ‘liberty, equality, humanity,
independence, unity,’ taught for years by brother Joseph Mazzini.</p>

<p>“Speculative Masonry has much, too, within its ranks to do. One is to accept
woman as a co-worker of man in the struggle of life, as the Hungarian Masons have
done lately by initiating the Countess Haideck. Another important thing is also to
recognize practically the brotherhood of all humanity by refusing none on account of
color, race, position, or creed. The dark-skinned should not be only theoretically the
brother of the light. The colored Masons who have been duly and regularly raised
stand at every lodge-door in America craving admission, and they are refused. And
there is South America to be conquered to a participation in the duties of humanity.</p>

<p>“If Masonry be, as claimed, a progressive science and a school of pure religion, it
should ever be found in the advance guard of civilization, not in the rear. If it be but
an empirical effort, a crude attempt of humanity to solve some of the deepest problems
of the race, and no more, then it must give place to fitter successors, perchance one of
those that you and I know of, one that may have acted the prompter at the side of the
chiefs of the Order, during its greatest triumphs, whispering to them as the dæmon did
in the ear of Socrates.</p>

<p>Thus falls to ruins the grand epic poem of Masons, sung by so many
mysterious Knights as another revealed gospel. As we see, the Temple
of Solomon is being undermined and brought to the ground by its own
chief “Master Masons,” of this century. But if, following the ingenious
exoteric description of the <cite>Bible</cite>, there are yet Masons who persist in
regarding it as once an actual structure, who, of the students of the esoteric
doctrine will ever consider this mythic temple otherwise than an
allegory, embodying the secret science? Whether or not there ever was
a real temple of that name, we may well leave to archæologists to decide;
but that the detailed description thereof in <cite>1 Kings</cite> is purely allegorical,
no serious scholar, proficient in the ancient as well as mediæval jargon
of the kabalists and alchemists, can doubt. The building of the Temple
of Solomon is the symbolical representation of the gradual acquirement
of the <i>secret</i> wisdom, or magic; the erection and development of the
spiritual from the earthly; the manifestation of the power and splendor
of the spirit in the physical world, through the wisdom and genius of the
builder. The latter, when he has become an adept, is a mightier king
than Solomon himself, the emblem of the sun or <em>Light</em> himself—the light
of the real subjective world, shining in the darkness of the objective universe.
This is the “Temple” which can be reared <em>without the sound
of the hammer, or any tool of iron being heard in the house while it is
“in building.”</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>

In the East, this science is called, in some places, the “seven-storied,”
in others, the “nine-storied” Temple; every story answers
allegorically to a degree of knowledge acquired. Throughout the countries
of the Orient, wherever magic and the wisdom-religion are studied,
its practitioners and students are known among their craft as Builders—for
they build the temple of knowledge, of secret science. Those of the
adepts who are active, are styled practical or <em>operative</em> Builders, while
the students, or neophytes are classed as <em>speculative</em> or theoretical. The
former exemplify in works their control over the forces of inanimate as
well as animate nature; the latter are but perfecting themselves in the
rudiments of the sacred science. These terms were evidently borrowed
at the beginning by the unknown founders of the first Masonic guilds.</p>

<p>In the now popular jargon, “Operative Masons” are understood to
be the bricklayers and the handicraftsmen, who composed the Craft down
to Sir Christopher Wren’s time; and “Speculative Masons,” all members
of the Order, as now understood. The sentence attributed to Jesus,
“Thou art Peter ... upon this rock I will build my church; and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it,” disfigured, as it is, by mistranslation
and misinterpretation, plainly indicates its real meaning. We have
shown the signification of <i>Pater</i> and <i>Petra</i>, with the hierophants—the
interpretation traced on the tables of stone of the final initiation, was
handed by the initiator to the chosen future interpreter. Having acquainted
himself with its mysterious contents, which revealed to him the
mysteries of creation, the initiated became a <em>builder</em> himself, for he was
made acquainted with the <em>dodecahedron</em>, or the geometrical figure on
which the universe was built. To what he had learned in previous initiations
of the use of the rule and of architectural principles, was added a
cross, the perpendicular and horizontal lines of which were supposed to
form the foundation of the spiritual temple, by placing them across the
junction, or central primordial point, the element of all
 <span class="lock">existences,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_800" id="FNanchor_800">[800]</a></span>
 representing
the first concrete idea of deity. Henceforth he could, as a
Master builder (see <cite>1 Corinthians</cite>, <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 10), erect a temple of wisdom on
that rock of <i>Petra</i>, for himself; and having laid a sure foundation, let
“another build thereon.”</p>

<p>The Egyptian hierophant was given a square head-dress, which he
had to wear always, and a square (see Mason’s marks), without which he
could never go abroad. The perfect <em>Tau</em> formed of the perpendicular
(descending male ray, or spirit) a horizontal line (or matter, female ray),
and the mundane circle was an attribute of Isis, and, it is but at his death
that the Egyptian cross was laid on the breast of his mummy. These

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>

square hats are worn unto this day by the Armenian priests. The claim
that the cross is purely a Christian symbol introduced after our era, is
strange indeed, when we find Ezekiel stamping the foreheads of the men
of Judah, who feared the Lord (<cite>Ezekiel</cite> <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 4), with the <i>signa Thau</i>, as
it is translated in the Vulgate. In the ancient Hebrew this sign was
formed thus <sub><img alt="tilted cross" src="images/p393a.jpg" id="img_images_p393a.jpg"></sub>
 but in the original Egyptian hieroglyphics as a perfect
Christian cross <sub><img alt="erect cross" src="images/p393b.jpg" id="img_images_p393b.jpg"></sub>.
 In the <cite>Revelation</cite>, also, the “Alpha and
Omega” (spirit and matter), the first and the last, stamps the name of
his Father in the foreheads of the <em>elect</em>.</p>

<p>And if our statements are wrong, if Jesus was not an initiate, a Master-builder,
or Master-Mason as it is now called, how comes it, that on the
most ancient cathedrals we find his figure with Mason’s marks about his
person? In the Cathedral of Santa Croce, Florence, over the main portal
can be seen the figure of Christ holding a perfect square in his hand.</p>

<p>The surviving “Master-builders” of the <em>operative</em> craft of the true
Temple, may go literally <em>half-naked</em> and wander <em>slipshod</em> for ever—now
not for the sake of a puerile ceremony, but because, like the “Son of
man,” they have not where to lay their heads—and yet be the only surviving
possessors of the “Word.” Their “cable-tow” is the sacred
triple cord of certain Brahman-Sannyâsi, or the string on which certain
lamas hang their <i>yu-stone</i>; but with these apparently valueless talismans,
not one of them would part for all the wealth of Solomon and Sheba.
The seven-knotted bamboo stick of the fakir can become as powerful as
the rod of Moses “which was created between the evenings, and on
which was engraven and set forth the great and glorious <span class="smcap">Name</span>, with
which he was to do the wonders in Mizraim.”</p>

<p>But these “operative workmen” have no fear that their secrets will
be disclosed by treacherous ex-high priests of chapters, though their
generation may have received them through others than “Moses, Solomon,
and Zerubbabel.” Had Moses Michael Hayes, the Israelite Brother
who introduced Royal Arch Masonry into this country (in December.
 <span class="lock">1778),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_801" id="FNanchor_801">[801]</a></span>
 had a prophetic presentiment of future treasons, he might have
instituted more efficacious obligations than he has.</p>

<p>Truly, the grand omnific Royal Arch word, “<cite>long lost but now found</cite>,”
has fulfilled its prophetic promise. The password of that degree is no
more “<span class="smcap">I am that I am</span>.” It is now simply “I was but am no more!”</p>

That we may not be accused of vain boasting, we shall give the keys
to several of the secret ciphers of the most exclusive and important of
the so-called higher Masonic degrees. If we mistake not, these have
never before been revealed to the outside world (except that of the
Royal Arch Masons, in 1830), but have been most jealously guarded
within the various Orders. We are under neither promise, obligation, nor
oath, and therefore violate no confidence. Our purpose is not to gratify
an idle curiosity; we wish merely to show Masons and the affiliates of
all other Western societies—the Company of Jesus included—that it is
impossible for them to be secure in the possession of any secrets that it
is worth an Eastern Brotherhood’s while to discover. Inferentially, it
may also show them that if the latter can lift the masks of European
societies, they are nevertheless successful in wearing their own visors;
for, if any one thing is universally acknowledged, it is that the real secrets
of not a single surviving ancient brotherhood are in possession of the
profane.</p>

<p>Some of these ciphers were used by the Jesuits in their secret correspondence
at the time of the Jacobin conspiracy, and when Masonry (the
alleged successor to the Temple) was employed by the Church for political
purposes.</p>

<p>Findel says (see his <cite>History of Freemasonry</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 253) that in the
eighteenth century, “besides the modern Knights Templar, we see the
Jesuits ... disfiguring the fair face of Freemasonry. Many Masonic
authors, who were fully cognizant of the period, and knew exactly all the
incidents occurring, positively assert that then and still later the Jesuits
exercised a pernicious influence, or at least endeavored to do so, upon the
fraternity.” Of the Rosicrucian Order he remarks, upon the authority of
<abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Woog, that its “aim at first ... was nothing less than the support
and advancement of Catholicism. <em>When this religion manifested a determination
entirely to repress liberty of thought</em> ... the Rosicrucians enlarged
their designs likewise to check, if possible, the progress of this
widely-spreading enlightenment.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Sincerus Renatus</cite> (the truly converted) of S. Richter, of Berlin
(1714), we note that laws were communicated for the government of the
“Golden Rosicrucians,” which “bear unmistakable evidences of Jesuitical
intervention.”</p>

<p>We will begin with the cryptographs of the “Sovereign Princes Rose
Croix,” also styled <i>Knights of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew, Knights of the Eagle and
Pelican, Heredom, Rosæ Crucis, Rosy Cross, Triple Cross, Perfect
Brother, Prince Mason, and so on</i>. The “Heredom Rosy Cross” also
claims a Templar origin, in

may well present it slightly amplified.</p>

<p>The cipher consists of certain combinations of right angles, with or
without points or dots. Following is the basis of its</p>

<p class="center"><i>Formation.</i></p>

<div class="divcenter80">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>

Now, the alphabet consists of twenty-six letters, and these two signs
being dissected, form thirteen distinct characters, thus:</p>

<div class="divcenter80">
 <img alt="Royal Arch cipher" src="images/p397a.jpg" id="img_images_p397a.jpg">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>A point placed within each gives thirteen more, thus:</p>

<div class="divcenter80">
 <img alt="Royal Arch cipher" src="images/p397b.jpg" id="img_images_p397b.jpg">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Making a total of twenty-six, equal to the number of letters in the
English alphabet.</p>

<p>There are two ways, at least, of combining and using these characters
for the purposes of secret correspondence. One method is to call
the first sign, <img alt="a symbol" src="images/p397e.jpg" id="img_images_p397e.jpg"> a; the same, with a point, ⟓ b, etc. Another is to
apply them, in their regular course, to the first half of the alphabet,
<img alt="a symbol" src="images/p397e.jpg" id="img_images_p397e.jpg_1"> a, ⊓ b, and so on, to m; after which, repeat them with a dot,
beginning with ⟓ n, <img alt="o symbol" src="images/p397h.jpg" id="img_images_p397h.jpg"> o, etc., to ⋖ z.</p>

<p>The alphabet, according to the first method, stands thus:</p>

<div class="divcenter80">
 <img alt="Royal Arch cipher" src="images/p397j.jpg" id="img_images_p397j.jpg">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>According to the second method, thus:</p>

<div class="divcenter80">
 <img alt="Royal Arch cipher" src="images/p397k.jpg" id="img_images_p397k.jpg">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>Besides these signs, the French Masons, evidently under the tuition
of their accomplished masters—the Jesuits, have perfected this cipher in
all its details. So they have signs even for commas, diphthongs, accents,
dots, etc., and these are</p>

<div class="figcenter">
 <img alt="Royal Arch cipher" src="images/p397l.jpg" id="img_images_p397l.jpg">
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>

Let this suffice. We might, if we chose, give the cipher alphabets
with their keys, of another method of the Royal Arch Masons, strongly
resembling a certain Hindu character; of the G ∴ El ∴ of the Mystic
City; of a well-known form of the Devanagari script of the (French) Sages
of the Pyramids; and of the Sublime Master of the Great Work, and
others. But we refrain; only, be it understood, for the reason that some
of these alone of all the side branches of the original Blue Lodge Freemasonry,
contain the promise of a useful future. As for the rest, they
may and will go to the ash-heap of time. High Masons will understand
what we mean.</p>

<p>We must now give some proofs of what we have stated, and demonstrate
that the word Jehovah, if Masonry adheres to it, will ever remain
as a substitute, never be identical with the lost mirific name. This is so
well known to the kabalists, that in their careful etymology of the יהוה
they show it beyond doubt to be only one of the many substitutes for the
real name, and composed of the two-fold name of the first androgyne—Adam
and Eve, Jod (or Yodh), Vau and He-Va—the female serpent as
a symbol of Divine Intelligence proceeding from the <span class="smcap">One</span>-Generative or
<em>Creative</em>
 <span class="lock">Spirit.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_804" id="FNanchor_804">[804]</a></span>
 Thus, Jehovah is not the sacred name at all. Had
Moses given to Pharaoh the <em>true</em> “name,” the latter would not have answered
as he did, for the Egyptian King-Initiates knew it as well as
Moses, who had learned it with them. <em>The</em> “name” was at that time
the common property of the adepts of all the nations in the world, and
Pharaoh knew certainly the “name” of the Highest God mentioned in
the <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>. But instead of that, Moses (if we accept the
allegory of <cite>Exodus</cite> literally), gives Pharaoh the name of <i>Yeva</i>, the expression
or form of the Divine name used by all the <i>Targums</i> as passed
by Moses. Hence Pharaoh’s reply: “And who is that
 <span class="lock"><i>Yeva</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_805" id="FNanchor_805">[805]</a></span>
 that I
should obey his voice?”</p>

<p>“Jehovah” dates only from the Masoretic innovation. When the
Rabbis, for fear that they should lose the keys to their own doctrines,
then written exclusively in consonants, began to insert their vowel-points
in their manuscripts, they were utterly ignorant of the true pronunciation
of the <span class="allsmcap">NAME</span>. Hence, they gave it the sound of <i>Adonah</i>, and
made it read <i>Ja-ho-vah</i>. Thus the latter is simply a fancy, a perversion
of the Holy Name. And how could they know it? Alone, out of all
their nation the high priests had it in their possession, and respectively
passed it to their successors, as the Hindu Brahmaâtma does before his
death. Once a year only, on the day of atonement, the high priest was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>

allowed to pronounce it in a whisper. Passing behind the veil into the
inner chamber of the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies, with trembling lips
and downcast eyes he called upon the dreaded <span class="allsmcap">NAME</span>. The bitter persecution
of the kabalists, who received the precious syllables after
deserving the favor by a whole life of sanctity, was due to a suspicion
that they misused it. At the opening of this chapter we have told the
story of Simeon Ben-Iochaï, one of the victims to this priceless knowledge,
and see how little he deserved his cruel treatment.</p>

<p>The <cite>Book of Jasher</cite>, a work—as we are told by a very learned
Hebrew divine, of New York—composed in Spain in the twelfth century
as “a popular tale,” and that had not “the sanction of the Rabbinical
College of Venice,” is full of kabalistical, alchemical, and magical allegories.
Admitting so much, it must still be said that there are few popular
tales but are based on historical truths. The <cite>Norsemen in Iceland</cite>,
by Dr. G. W. Dasent, is also a collection of popular tales, but they contain
the key to the primitive religious worship of that people. So with
the <cite>Book of Jasher</cite>. It contains the whole of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> in a
condensed form, and as the Samaritans held, <i>i.e.</i>, the five <cite>Books of
Moses</cite>, without the Prophets. Although rejected by the orthodox Rabbis,
we cannot help thinking that, as in the case of the apocryphal <cite>Gospels</cite>,
which were written earlier than the canonical ones, the <cite>Book of Jasher</cite>
is the true original from which the subsequent <cite>Bible</cite> was in part composed.
Both the apocryphal <cite>Gospels</cite> and <cite>Jasher</cite>, are a series of religious
tales, in which miracle is heaped upon miracle, and which narrate the
popular legends as they first originated, without any regard to either
chronology or dogma. Still both are corner-stones of the Mosaic and
Christian religions. That there was a <cite>Book of Jasher</cite> prior to the
Mosaic <cite>Pentateuch</cite> is clear, for it is mentioned in <cite>Joshua</cite>, <cite>Isaiah</cite>, and
<cite>2 Samuel</cite>.</p>

<p>Nowhere is the difference between the Elohists and Jehovists so
clearly shown as in <cite>Jasher</cite>. Jehovah is here spoken of as the Ophites
held him to be, a Son of Ilda-Baoth, or Saturn. In this Book, the Egyptian
Magi, when asked by Pharaoh “Who is he, of whom Moses speaks as
the <em>I am</em>?” reply that the God of Moses “we have learned, is the Son
of the Wise, the Son of ancient kings” (<abbr title="chapter seventy-nine">ch. lxxix.</abbr>
 <span class="lock">45).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_806" id="FNanchor_806">[806]</a></span>
 Now, those
who assert that <cite>Jasher</cite> is a forgery of the twelfth century—and we
readily believe it—should nevertheless explain the curious fact that, while
the above text is <em>not</em> to be found in the <cite>Bible</cite>, the answer to it <em>is</em>, and is,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>

moreover, couched in unequivocal terms. At <cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="nineteen">xix.</abbr> 11, the
“Lord God” complains of it very wrathfully to the prophet, and says:
“Surely the princes of Zoan <em>are fools</em>, the counsel of the wise counsellors
of Pharaoh is become brutish; how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the
Son of the Wise, the Son of ancient kings?” which is evidently a reply
to the above. At <cite>Joshua</cite> <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 13, <cite>Jasher</cite> is referred to in corroboration of
the outrageous assertion that the sun stood still, and the moon stayed
until the people had avenged themselves. “Is not this written in the
<cite>Book of Jasher</cite>?” says the text. And at <cite>2 Samuel</cite>, <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 19, the same book
is again quoted. “Behold,” it says, “it is written in the <cite>Book of Jasher</cite>.”
Clearly, <cite>Jasher</cite> must have existed; it must have been regarded as authority;
must have been older than Joshua; and, since the verse in <cite>Isaiah</cite>
unerringly points to the passage above quoted, we have at least as much
reason to accept the current edition of <cite>Jasher</cite> as a transcription, excerpt,
or compilation of the original work, as we have to revere the Septuagint
<cite>Pentateuch</cite>, as the primitive Hebraic sacred records.</p>

<p>At all events, Jehovah is not the ancient of the ancient, or “aged of
the aged,” of the <cite>Sohar</cite>; for we find him, in this book, counselling with
God the Father as to the creation of the world. “The work-master spoke
to the Lord. Let us make man after our image” (<cite>Sohar</cite> <abbr title="one, folio">i., fol.</abbr> 25).
Jehovah is but the Metatron, and perhaps, not even the highest, but
only one of the Æons; for he whom Onkelos calls <i>Memro</i>, the “Word,”
is not the <em>exoteric</em> Jehovah of the <cite>Bible</cite>, nor is he
Jahve יַהְוֶה the
Existing One.</p>

<p>It was the secresy of the early kabalists, who were anxious to screen
the real Mystery name of the “Eternal” from profanation, and later the
prudence which the mediæval alchemists and occultists were compelled to
adopt to save their lives, that caused the inextricable confusion of divine
names. This is what led the people to accept the Jehovah of the <cite>Bible</cite>
as the name of the “One living God.” Every Jewish elder, prophet,
and other man of any importance knew the difference; but as the difference
lay in the vocalization of the “name,” and its right pronunciation
led to death, the common people were ignorant of it, for no initiate would
risk his life by teaching it to them. Thus the Sinaitic deity came gradually
to be regarded as identical with “Him whose name is known but
to the wise.” When Capellus translates: “Whosoever shall pronounce
the name of Jehovah, shall suffer death,” he makes two mistakes. The
first is in adding the final letter <i>h</i> to the name, if he wants this deity to
be considered either male or androgynous, for the letter makes the name
feminine, as it really should be, considering it is one of the names of
Binah, the third emanation; his second error is in asserting that the word
<i>nokeb</i> means only to pronounce <em>distinctly</em>. It means to pronounce <em>correctly</em>.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>

Therefore, the biblical name Jehovah may be considered simply
a <em>substitute</em>, which, as belonging to one of the “powers” got to be viewed
as that of the “Eternal.” There is an evident mistake (one of the very
many), in one of the texts in <cite>Leviticus</cite>, which has been corrected by
Cahen, and which proves that the interdiction did not at all concern the
name of the exoteric Jehovah, whose numerous other names could also
be pronounced without any penalty being
 <span class="lock">incurred.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_807" id="FNanchor_807">[807]</a></span>
 In the vicious
English version, the translation runs thus: “And he that blasphemeth
the name of the Lord, shall surely be put to death,” <abbr title="Leviticus twenty-four"><cite>Levit.</cite> xxiv.</abbr> 16.
Cahen renders it far more correctly, thus: “And he that blasphemeth
the name of the <em>Eternal</em> shall die,” etc. The “Eternal” being something
higher than the exoteric and personal
 <span class="lock">“Lord.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_808" id="FNanchor_808">[808]</a></span></p>

<p>As with the Gentile nations, the symbols of the Israelites were ever
bearing, directly or indirectly, upon sun-worship. The exoteric Jehovah
of the <cite>Bible</cite> is a <em>dual</em> god, like all the other gods; and the fact that David—who
is entirely ignorant of Moses—praises his “Lord,” and assures
him that the “Lord <em>is</em> a great God, and a great King above all gods,”
may be of a very great importance to the descendants of Jacob and
David, but their national God concerns us in no wise. We are quite
ready to show the “Lord God” of Israel the same respect as we do to
Brahma, Zeus, or any other secondary deity. But we decline, most emphatically,
to recognize in him either the Deity worshipped by Moses,
or the “Father” of Jesus, or yet the “Ineffable Name” of the kabalists.
Jehovah is, perhaps, one of the <i>Elohim</i>, who was concerned in
the <em>formation</em> (which is not creation) of the universe, one of the architects
who built from pre-existing matter, but he never was the “Unknowable”
Cause that created “bara,” in the night of the Eternity. These
Elohim first form and bless; then they <em>curse</em> and <em>destroy</em>; as one of these
Powers, Jehovah is therefore by turns beneficent and malevolent; at one
moment he punishes and then repents. He is the antitype of several of
the patriarchs—of Esau and of Jacob, the allegorical twins, emblems of
the ever manifest dual principle in nature. So Jacob, who is Israel, is
the left pillar—the feminine principle of Esau, who is the right pillar and
the male principle. When he wrestles with Malach-Iho, the Lord, it is
the latter who becomes the <em>right</em> pillar, and Jacob-Israel names God;
although the <cite>Bible</cite>-interpreters have endeavored to transform him into a
mere “angel of the Lord” (<cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="thirty-two">xxxii.</abbr>), Jacob conquers him—as matter
will but too often conquer spirit—but his <em>thigh</em> is put out of joint in the
fight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>

The name of Israel has its derivation from Isaral or Asar, the Sun-God,
who is known as Suryal, Surya, and Sur. Isra-el means “striving
with God.” The “sun rising upon Jacob-Israel,” is the <em>Sun</em>-God Isaral,
fecundating <em>matter</em> or earth, represented by the <em>female</em>-Jacob. As usual,
the allegory has more than one hidden meaning in the <cite>Kabala</cite>. Esau,
Æsaou, Asu, is also the sun. Like the “Lord,” Esau fights with Jacob
and prevails not. The God-<em>Sun</em> first strives against, and then rises on
him in covenant.</p>

<p>“And as he passed over Penuel, <em>the sun rose upon him</em>, and he
(Jacob) <em>halted upon his thigh</em>” (Genesis <abbr title="thirty-two">xxxii.</abbr> 31). <em>Israel</em> Jacob,
opposed by his brother Esau, is <em>Samael</em>, and “the names of Samael are
Azazel and <em>Satan</em>” (the opposer).</p>

<p>If it will be argued that Moses was unacquainted with the Hindu
philosophy and, therefore, could not have taken Siva, the regenerator and
the destroyer, as his model for Jehovah, then we must admit that there was
some miraculous international intuition which prompted every nation to
choose for its exoteric national deity the dual type we find in the “Lord
God” of Israel. All these fables speak for themselves. Siva, Jehovah,
Osiris, are all the symbols of the active principle in nature <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>.
They are the forces which preside at the formation or <em>regeneration</em> of
matter and its destruction. They are the types of Life and Death, ever
fecundating and decomposing under the never-ceasing influx of the
<i lang="la">anima mundi</i>, the Universal intellectual Soul, the invisible but ever-present
spirit which is behind the correlation of the blind forces. This
spirit alone is immutable, and therefore the forces of the universe, cause
and effect, are ever in perfect harmony with this one great Immutable
Law. Spiritual Life is the one primordial principle <em>above</em>; Physical Life
is the primordial principle <em>below</em>, but they are one under their dual
aspect. When the Spirit is completely untrammelled from the fetters of
correlation, and its essence has become so purified as to be re-united with
its <span class="allsmcap">CAUSE</span>, it may—and yet who can tell whether it really will—have a
glimpse of the Eternal Truth. Till then, let us not build ourselves idols
in our own image, and accept the shadows for the Eternal Light.</p>

<p>The greatest mistake of the age was to attempt a comparison of the
relative merits of all the ancient religions, and scoff at the doctrines of
the <cite>Kabala</cite> and other superstitions.</p>

<p>But truth is stranger than fiction; and this world-old adage finds its
application in the case in hand. The “wisdom” of the archaic ages or
the “secret doctrine” embodied in the <cite>Oriental Kabala</cite>, of which, as
we have said, the Rabbinical is but an abridgment, did not die out with
the Philoletheans of the last Eclectic school. The <i>Gnosis</i> lingers still
on earth, and its votaries are many, albeit unknown. Such secret

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>

brotherhoods have been mentioned before Mackenzie’s time, by more
than one great author. If they have been regarded as mere fictions of
the novelist, that fact has only helped the “brother-adepts” to keep their
incognito the more easily. We have personally known several of them
who, to their great merriment had had the story of their lodges, the
communities in which they lived, and the wondrous powers which they
had exercised for many long years, laughed at and denied by unsuspecting
skeptics to their very faces. Some of these brothers belong to the
small groups of “travellers.” Until the close of the happy Louis-Philippian
reign, they were pompously termed by the Parisian garçon and
trader, the <i lang="fr">nobles étrangers</i>, and as innocently believed to be “Boyards,”
Valachian “Gospodars,” Indian “Nabobs,” and Hungarian “Margraves,”
who had gathered at the capital of the civilized world to admire its
monuments and partake of its dissipations. There are, however, some
<em>insane</em> enough to connect the presence of certain of these mysterious
guests in Paris with the great political events that subsequently took
place. Such recall at least as very remarkable coincidences, the breaking
out of the Revolution of ‘93, and the earlier explosion of the South
Sea Bubble, soon after the appearance of “noble foreigners,” who had
convulsed all Paris for more or less longer periods, by either their mystical
doctrines or “supernatural gifts.” The <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Germains and Cagliostros
of this century, having learned bitter lessons from the vilifications
and persecutions of the past, pursue different tactics now-a-days.</p>

<p>But there are numbers of these mystic brotherhoods which have
naught to do with “civilized” countries; and it is in their unknown
communities that are concealed the skeletons of the past. These
“adepts” could, if they chose, lay claim to strange ancestry, and exhibit
verifiable documents that would explain many a mysterious page in
both sacred and profane history. Had the keys to the hieratic writings
and the secret of Egyptian and Hindu symbolism been known to the
Christian Fathers, they would not have allowed a single monument
of old to stand unmutilated. And yet, if we are well informed—and we
think we are—there was not one such in all Egypt, but the secret records
of its hieroglyphics were carefully registered by the sacerdotal caste.
These records still exist, though “not extant” for the general public,
though perhaps the monuments may have passed away for ever out of
human sight.</p>

<p>Of forty-seven tombs of the kings, near Gornore, recorded by the
Egyptian priests on their sacred registers, only seventeen were known to
the public, according to Diodorus Siculus, who visited the place about
sixty years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Notwithstanding this <em>historical</em> evidence, we assert that
the whole number exist to this day, and the royal tomb discovered by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>

Belzoni among the sandstone mountains of Biban el-Melook (Melech?)
is but a feeble specimen of the rest. We will add, furthermore, that the
Arab-Christians, the monks, scattered around in their poor, desolate
convents on the borderland of the great Lybian Desert, know of the
existence of such unbetrayed relics. But they are Copts, sole remnants
of the true Egyptian race, and the Copt predominating over the Christian
monk in their natures, they keep silent; for what reason it is not for us
to tell. There are some who believe that their monkish attire is but a
blind, and that they have chosen these desolate homes among arid deserts
and surrounded by Mahometan tribes, for some ulterior purposes of their
own. Be it as it may, they are held in great esteem by the Greek monks
of Palestine; and there is a rumor current among the Christian pilgrims
of Jerusalem, who throng the Holy Sepulchre at every Easter, that the
holy fire from heaven will never descend so <em>miraculously</em> as when these
monks of the desert are present to draw it down by their
 <span class="lock">prayers.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_809" id="FNanchor_809">[809]</a></span></p>

<p>“The kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take
it by force.” Many are the candidates at the doors of those who are
supposed to know the path that leads to the secret brotherhoods. The
great majority are refused admittance, and these turn away interpreting
the refusal as an evidence of the non-existence of any such secret society.
Of the minority accepted, more than two-thirds fail upon trial. The
seventh rule of the ancient Rosicrucian brotherhoods, which is universal
among all true secret societies: “the Rosy-Crux becomes and is not
<em>made</em>,” is more than the generality of men can bear to have applied to
them. But let no one suppose that of the candidates who fail, any will
divulge to the world even the trifle they may have learned, as some
Masons do. None know better than themselves how unlikely it is that
a neophyte should ever talk of what was imparted to him. Thus these
societies will go on and hear themselves denied without uttering a word
until the day shall come for them to throw off their reserve and show
how completely they are masters of the situation.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Our</span> task will have been ill-performed if the preceding chapters
have not demonstrated that Judaism, earlier and later Gnosticism,
Christianity, and even Christian Masonry, have all been erected upon
identical cosmical myths, symbols, and allegories, whose full comprehension
is possible only to those who have inherited the key from their inventors.</p>

<p>In the following pages we will endeavor to show how much these have
been misinterpreted by the widely-different, yet intimately-related systems
enumerated above, in fitting them to their individual needs. Thus
not only will a benefit be conferred upon the student, but a long-deferred,
and now much-needed act of justice will be done to those earlier
generations whose genius has laid the whole human race under obligation.
Let us begin by once more comparing the myths of the <cite>Bible</cite> with
those of the sacred books of other nations, to see which is the original,
which copies.</p>

<p>There are but two methods which, correctly explained, can help us to
this result. They are—the <cite>Vedas</cite>, Brahmanical literature and the Jewish
<cite>Kabala</cite>. The former has, in a most philosophical spirit, conceived
these grandiose myths; the latter borrowing them from the Chaldeans
and Persians, shaped them into a history of the Jewish nation, in which
their spirit of philosophy was buried beyond the recognition of all but

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406">406</a></span>

the elect, and under a far more absurd form than the Aryan had given
them. The <cite>Bible</cite> of the Christian Church is the latest receptacle of this
scheme of disfigured allegories which have been erected into an edifice of
superstition, such as never entered into the conceptions of those from
whom the Church obtained her knowledge. The abstract fictions of antiquity,
which for ages had filled the popular fancy with but flickering shadows
and uncertain images, have in Christianity assumed the shapes of real
personages, and become accomplished facts. Allegory, metamorphosed,
becomes sacred history, and Pagan myth is taught to the people as a revealed
narrative of God’s intercourse with His chosen people.</p>

<p>“The myths,” says Horace in his <cite>Ars Poetica</cite>, “have been invented
by wise men to strengthen the laws and teach moral truths.” While
Horace endeavored to make clear the very spirit and essence of the
ancient myths, Euhemerus pretended, on the contrary, that “myths were
the legendary history of kings and heroes, transformed into gods by the
admiration of the nations.” It is the latter method which was inferentially
followed by Christians when they agreed upon the acceptation
of euhemerized patriarchs, and mistook them for men who had really
lived.</p>

<p>But, in opposition to this pernicious theory, which has brought forth
such bitter fruit, we have a long series of the greatest philosophers the
world has produced: Plato, Epicharmus, Socrates, Empedocles, Plotinus,
and Porphyry, Proclus, Damascenus, Origen, and even Aristotle. The
latter plainly stated this verity, by saying that a tradition of the highest
antiquity, transmitted to posterity under the form of various myths, teaches
us that the first principles of nature may be considered as “gods,” for
the <i>divine</i> permeates all nature. All the rest, details and personages,
were added later for the clearer comprehension of the vulgar, and but
too often with the object of supporting laws invented in the common interest.</p>

<p>Fairy tales do not exclusively belong to nurseries; all mankind—except
those few who in all ages have comprehended their hidden meaning and
tried to open the eyes of the superstitious—have listened to such tales in
one shape or the other and, after transforming them into sacred symbols,
called the product <span class="smcap">Religion</span>!</p>

<p>We will try to systematize our subject as much as the ever-recurring
necessity to draw parallels between the conflicting opinions that have
been based on the same myths will permit. We will begin by the book
of <cite>Genesis</cite>, and seek for its hidden meaning in the Brahmanical traditions
and the Chaldeo-Judaïc <cite>Kabala</cite>.</p>

<p>The first Scripture lesson taught us in our infancy is that God created
the world in six days, and rested on the <em>seventh</em>. Hence, a peculiar solenmity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407">407</a></span>

is supposed to attach to the seventh day, and the Christians, adopting
the rigid observances of the Jewish sabbath, have enforced it upon us
with the substitution of the first, instead of the seventh day of the week.</p>

<p>All systems of religious mysticism are based on numerals. With
Pythagoras, the Monas or unity, emanating the duad, and thus forming the
trinity, and the quaternary or Arba-il (the mystic <em>four</em>), compose the
number seven. The sacredness of numbers begins with the great First—the
<span class="allsmcap">ONE</span>, and ends only with the nought or zero—symbol of the
infinite and boundless circle which represents the universe. All the intervening
figures, in whatever combination, or however multiplied, represent
philosophical ideas, from vague outlines down to a definitely-established
scientific axiom, relating either to a moral or a physical fact
in nature. They are a key to the ancient views on cosmogony, in its
broad sense, including man and beings, and the evolution of the human
race, spiritually as well as physically.</p>

<p>The number <em>seven</em> is the most sacred of all, and is, undoubtedly, of
Hindu origin. Everything of importance was calculated by and fitted into
this number by the Aryan philosophers—ideas as well as localities. Thus
they have the</p>

<p><i>Sapta-Rishi</i>, or seven sages, typifying the seven diluvian primitive
races (post-diluvian as some say).</p>

<p><i>Sapta-Loka</i>, the seven inferior and superior worlds, whence each of
these Rishis proceeded, and whither he returned in glory before reaching
the final bliss of
 <span class="lock">Moksha.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_810" id="FNanchor_810">[810]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sapta-Kula</i>, or seven castes—the Brahmans assuming to represent the
direct descendants of the highest of
 <span class="lock">them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_811" id="FNanchor_811">[811]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, again, the Sapta-Pura (seven holy cities); Sapta-Duipa (seven
holy islands); Sapta-Samudra (the seven holy seas); Sapta-Parvata
(the seven holy mountains); Sapta-Arania (the seven deserts); Sapta-Vruksha
(the seven sacred trees); and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>

In the Chaldeo-Babylonian incantation, this number reappears again as
prominently as among the Hindus. The number is <em>dual</em> in its attributes,
<i>i.e.</i>, holy in one of its aspects it becomes nefast under other conditions.
Thus the following incantation we find traced on the Assyrian tablets,
now so correctly interpreted.</p>

<p>“The evening of evil omen, the region of the sky, which produces
misfortune....</p>

<p>“Message of pest.</p>

<p>“Deprecators of Nin-Ki-gal.</p>

<p>“The seven gods of the vast sky.</p>

<p>“The seven gods of the vast earth.</p>

<p>“The seven gods of blazing spheres.</p>

<p>“The seven gods of celestial legion.</p>

<p>“The seven gods maleficent.</p>

<p>“The seven phantoms—bad.</p>

<p>“The seven phantoms of maleficent flames....</p>

<p>“Bad demon, bad <i>alal</i>, bad <i>gigim</i>, bad <i>telal</i> ... bad god, bad <i>maskim</i>.</p>

<p>“Spirit of seven heavens remember.... Spirit of seven earths remember
... etc.”</p>

<p>This number reappears likewise on almost every page of <cite>Genesis</cite>,
and throughout the Mosaic books, and we find it conspicuous (see following
chapter) in the <cite>Book of Job</cite> and the Oriental <cite>Kabala</cite>. If the
Hebrew Semitics adopted it so readily, we must infer that it was not
blindly, but with a thorough knowledge of its secret meaning; hence,
that they must have adopted the doctrines of their “heathen” neighbors
as well. It is but natural, therefore, that we should seek in <em>heathen</em>
philosophy for the interpretation of this number, which again reappeared
in Christianity with its <em>seven</em> sacraments, <em>seven</em> churches in Asia Minor,
<em>seven</em> capital sins, <em>seven</em> virtues (four cardinal and three theological), etc.</p>

<p>Have the <em>seven</em> prismatic colors of the rainbow seen by Noah no other
meaning than that of a covenant between God and man to refresh the
memory of the former? To the kabalist, at least, they have a significance
inseparable from the seven labors of magic, the seven upper
spheres, the seven notes of the musical scale, the seven numerals of Pythagoras,
the seven wonders of the world, the seven ages, and even the
seven steps of the Masons, which lead to the Holy of Holies, after passing
the flights of <em>three</em> and <em>five</em>.</p>

<p>Whence the identity then of these enigmatical, ever-recurring numerals
that are found in every page of the Jewish Scriptures, as in every ola and
sloka of Buddhistic and Brahmanical books? Whence these numerals that
are the soul of the Pythagorean and Platonic thought, and that no unilluminated
Orientalist nor biblical student has ever been able to fathom?

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>

And yet they have a key ready in their hand, did they but know how to
use it. Nowhere is the mystical value of human language and its effects
on human action so perfectly understood as in India, nor any better
explained than by the authors of the oldest <cite>Brahmanas</cite>. Ancient as their
epoch is now found to be, they only try to express, in a more concrete
form, the abstract metaphysical speculations of their own ancestors.</p>

<p>Such is the respect of the Brahmans for the sacrificial mysteries, that
they hold that the world itself sprang into creation as a consequence of a
“sacrificial word” pronounced by the First Cause. This word is the
“Ineffable name” of the kabalists, fully discussed in the last chapter.</p>

<p>The secret of the <cite>Vedas</cite>, “Sacred Knowledge” though they may be,
is impenetrable without the help of the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>. Properly speaking,
the <cite>Vedas</cite> (which are written in verse and comprised in four books) constitute
that portion called the <i>Mantra</i>, or magical prayer, and the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>
(which are in prose) contain their key. While the Mantra part is
alone holy, the Brahmana portion contains all the theological exegesis,
and the speculations and explanations of the sacerdotal. Our Orientalists,
we repeat, will make no substantial progress toward a comprehension
of Vedic literature until they place a proper valuation upon works now
despised by them; as, for instance, the <cite>Aitareya</cite> and <cite>Kaushîtaki Brâhmanas</cite>,
which belong to the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>.</p>

<p>Zoroaster was called a <i>Manthran</i>, or speaker of Mantras, and, according
to Haug, one of the earliest names for the Sacred Scriptures of the
Parsis was <i>Mânthra-speñta</i>. The power and significance of the Brahman
who acts as the Hotri-priest at the Soma-Sacrifice, consists in his possession
and full knowledge of the uses of the sacred word or speech—<i>Vâch</i>.
The latter is personified in Sara-isvati, the wife of Brahma, who
is the goddess of the sacred or “Secret Knowledge.” She is usually depicted
as riding upon a peacock with its tail all spread. The eyes upon
the feathers of the bird’s tail, symbolize the sleepless eyes that see all
things. To one who has the ambition of becoming an adept of the
“Secret doctrines,” they are a reminder that he must have the hundred
eyes of Argus to see and comprehend all things.</p>

<p>And this is why we say that it is not possible to solve fully the deep
problems underlying the Brahmanical and Buddhistic sacred books without
having a perfect comprehension of the esoteric meaning of the Pythagorean
numerals. The greatest power of this Vâch, or Sacred Speech, is
developed according to the form which is given to the Mantra by the officiating
Hotri, and this form consists wholly in the numbers and syllables of
the sacred metre. If pronounced slowly and in a certain rhythm, one
effect is produced; if quickly and with another rhythm, there is a different
result. “Each metre,” says Haug, “is the invisible master of something

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>

visible in this world; it is, as it were, its exponent and ideal. This
great significance of the metrical speech is derived from the number of
syllables of which it consists, for each thing has (just as in the Pythagorean
system) a certain numerical proportion. All these things, metres
(chhandas), stomas, and prishthas, are liable to be as eternal and divine
as the words themselves they contain. The earliest Hindu divines did
not only believe in a primitive revelation of the words of the sacred texts,
but even in that of the various forms. These forms, along with their contents,
the everlasting <em>Veda</em>-words, are symbols expressive of things of the
invisible world, and in several respects comparable to the Platonic
ideas.”</p>

<p><em>This testimony from an unwilling witness shows again the identity
between the ancient religions as to their secret doctrine.</em> The Gâyatri
metre, for example, consists of <em>thrice eight</em> syllables, and is considered
the most sacred of metres. It is the metre of Agni, the fire-god, and becomes
at times the emblem of Brahma himself, the chief creator, and
“fashioner of man” in his own image. Now Pythagoras says that “The
number eight, or the Octad, is the first cube, that is to say, squared in
all senses, as a die, proceeding from its base two, or even number; <em>so is
man four-square or perfect</em>.” Of course few, except the Pythagoreans
and kabalists, can fully comprehend this idea; but the illustration will
assist in pointing out the close kinship of the numerals with the Vedic
<i>Mantras</i>. The chief problems of every theology lie concealed beneath
this imagery of fire and the varying rhythm of its flames. The burning
bush of the <cite>Bible</cite>, the Zoroastrian and other sacred fires, Plato’s universal
soul, and the Rosicrucian doctrines of both soul and body of man being
evolved out of fire, the reasoning and immortal element which permeates
all things, and which, according to Herakleitus, Hippocrates, and Parmenides,
is God, have all the same meaning.</p>

<p>Each metre in the <cite>Brahmanas</cite> corresponds to a number, and as
shown by Haug, as it stands in the sacred volumes, is a prototype of
some visible form on earth, and its effects are either good or evil. The
“sacred speech” can save, but it can kill as well; its many meanings
and faculties are well known but to the <i>Dikshita</i> (the adept), who has
been initiated into many mysteries, and whose “spiritual birth” is completely
achieved; the Vâch of the <i>mantra</i> is a spoken power, which
awakes another corresponding and still more occult power, each allegorically
personified by some god in the world of spirits, and, according as
it is used, responded to either by the gods or the <i>Rakshasas</i> (bad spirits).
In the Brahmanical and Buddhist ideas, a curse, a blessing, a vow, a
desire, an idle thought, can each assume a visible shape and so manifest
itself <em>objectively</em> to the eyes of its author, or to him that it concerns.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Every sin becomes incarnated, so to say, and like an avenging fiend
persecutes its perpetrator.</p>

<p>There are words which have a destructive quality in their very syllables,
as though objective things; for every sound awakens a corresponding
one in the invisible world of spirit, and the repercussion produces either
a good or bad effect. Harmonious rhythm, a melody vibrating softly in
the atmosphere, creates a beneficent and sweet influence around, and
acts most powerfully on the psychological as well as physical natures of
every living thing on earth; it reacts even on inanimate objects, for matter
is still spirit in its essence, invisible as it may seem to our grosser senses.</p>

<p>So with the numerals. Turn wherever we will, from the Prophets to
the Apocalypse, and we will see the biblical writers constantly using
the numbers <em>three</em>, <em>four</em>, <em>seven</em>, and <em>twelve</em>.</p>

<p>And yet we have known some partisans of the <cite>Bible</cite> who maintained
that the <cite>Vedas</cite> were copied from the Mosaic
 <span class="lock">books!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_812" id="FNanchor_812">[812]</a></span>
 The <cite>Vedas</cite>,
which are written in Sanscrit, a language whose grammatical rules and
forms, as Max Müller and other scholars confess, were <em>completely established</em>
long before the days when the great wave of emigration bore it
from Asia all over the Occident, are there to proclaim their parentage of
every philosophy, and every religious institution developed later among
Semitic peoples. And which of the numerals most frequently occur in
the Sanscrit chants, those sublime hymns to creation, to the unity of
God, and the countless manifestations of His power? <span class="smcap">One</span>, <span class="allsmcap">THREE</span>, and
<span class="allsmcap">SEVEN</span>. Read the hymn by Dirghatamas.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">To Him who represents all the Gods.</span>”</p>

<p>“The <em>God</em> here present, our blessed patron, our sacrificer, has a
brother who spreads himself in mid-air. There exists a <em>third</em> Brother
whom we sprinkle with our libations.... It is he whom I have seen
master of men and armed with <em>seven</em>
 <span class="lock">rays.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_813" id="FNanchor_813">[813]</a></span></p>

<p>And again:</p>

<p>“<em>Seven</em> Bridles aid in guiding a car which has but <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> wheel, and
which is drawn by a single horse that shines with <em>seven</em> rays. The
wheel has <em>three</em> limbs, an immortal wheel, never-wearying, whence hang
all the worlds.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes <em>seven</em> horses drag a car of <em>seven</em> wheels, and <em>seven</em> personages
mount it, accompanied by <em>seven</em> fecund nymphs of the water.”</p>

<p>And the following again, in honor of the fire-god—<i>Agni</i>, who is so
clearly shown but a spirit subordinate to the <span class="smcap">One</span> God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>

“Ever <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span>, although having <em>three</em> forms of double nature (androgynous)—he
rises! and the priests offer to <i>God</i>, in the act of sacrifice, their
prayers which reach the heavens, borne aloft by Agni.”</p>

<p>Is this a coincidence, or, rather, as reason tells us, the result of the
derivation of many national cults from one primitive, universal religion?
A <em>mystery</em> for the uninitiated, the <em>unveiling</em> of the most sublime (because
correct and true) psychological and physiological problems for the
initiate. Revelations of the personal spirit of man which is divine because
that spirit is not only the emanation of the <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> Supreme God, but
is the only God man is able, in his weakness and helplessness, to comprehend—to
feel <em>within</em> himself. This truth the Vedic poet clearly confesses,
when saying:</p>

<p>“The Lord, Master of the universe and full of wisdom, has entered
with me (into me)—weak and ignorant—and has formed me of <em>himself</em>
in that
 <span class="lock">place<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_814" id="FNanchor_814">[814]</a></span>
 where the spirits obtain, by the help of <em>Science</em>, the peaceful
enjoyment of the <em>fruit</em>, as sweet as ambrosia.”</p>

<p>Whether we call this fruit “an apple” from the Tree of Knowledge,
or the <i>pippala</i> of the Hindu poet, it matters not. It is the fruit of esoteric
wisdom. Our object is to show the existence of a religious system in India
for many thousands of years before the exoteric fables of the Garden
of Eden and the Deluge had been invented. Hence the identity of doctrines.
Instructed in them, each of the initiates of other countries became,
in his turn, the founder of some great school of philosophy in the West.</p>

<p>Who of our Sanscrit scholars has ever felt interested in discovering
the real sense of the following hymns, palpable as it is: “<em>Pippala</em>, the
sweet fruit of that tree upon which come <em>spirits</em> who love the <em>science</em> (?)
and where <em>the gods produce all marvels</em>. This is a mystery for him <em>who
knows not the Father</em> of the world.”</p>

<p>Or this one again:</p>

<p>“These stanzas bear at their head a title which announces that they
are consecrated to the <i>Viswadévas</i> (that is to say, to all the gods). He
who knows not the Being whom I sing <em>in all his manifestations</em>, will
comprehend nothing of my verses; those who do know <span class="smcap">Him</span> are not
strangers to this reünion.”</p>

<p>This refers to the reünion and parting of the immortal and mortal
parts of man. “The immortal Being,” says the preceding stanza, “is in
the cradle of the mortal Being. The two eternal spirits go and come
everywhere; only some men know the one without knowing the other”
(<i>Dirghatamas</i>).</p>

<p>Who can give a correct idea of Him of whom the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> says:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>
“That which is One the wise call it in divers manners.” That One
is sung by the Vedic poets in all its manifestations in nature; and the
books considered “childish and foolish” teach how at will to call the
beings of wisdom for our instruction. They teach, as Porphyry says:
“a liberation from all terrene concerns ... a flight of the <em>alone</em> to the
<span class="smcap">Alone</span>.”</p>

<p>Professor Max Müller, whose every word is accepted by his school
as philological gospel, is undoubtedly right in one sense when in determining
the nature of the Hindu gods, he calls them “masks without an
actor ... names without being, not beings without
 <span class="lock">names.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_815" id="FNanchor_815">[815]</a></span>
 For he
but proves thereby the monotheism of the ancient Vedic religion. But
it seems to us more than dubious whether he or any scientist of his
school needed hope to fathom the old
 <span class="lock">Aryan<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_816" id="FNanchor_816">[816]</a></span>
 thought, without an accurate
study of those very “masks.” To the materialist, as to the scientist,
who for various reasons endeavors to work out the difficult problem of
compelling facts to agree with either their own hobbies or those of the
<cite>Bible</cite>, they may seem but the empty shells of phantoms. Yet such
authorities will ever be, as in the past, the unsafest of guides, except in
matters of exact science. The <cite>Bible</cite> patriarchs are as much “masks
without actors,” as the pragâpatis, and yet, if the living personage behind
these masks is but an abstract shadow there is an idea embodied in every
one of them which belongs to the philosophical and scientific theories of
ancient
 <span class="lock">wisdom.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_817" id="FNanchor_817">[817]</a></span>
 And who can render better service in this work than
the native Brahmans themselves, or the kabalists?</p>

<p>To deny, point-blank, any sound philosophy in the later Brahmanical
speculations upon the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>, is equivalent to refusing to ever correctly
understand the mother-religion itself, which gave rise to them, and
which is the expression of the inner thought of the direct ancestors of
these later authors of the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>. If learned Europeans can so

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>

readily show that all the Vedic gods are but empty masks, they must also
be ready to demonstrate that the Brahmanical authors were as incapable
as themselves to discover these “actors” anywhere. This done, not
only the three other sacred books which Max Müller says “do not deserve
the name of <cite>Vedas</cite>,” but the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> itself becomes a meaningless
jumble of words; for what the world-renowned and subtile intellect of
the ancient Hindu sages failed to understand, no modern scientist, however
learned, can hope to fathom. Poor Thomas Taylor was right in
saying that “philology is not philosophy.”</p>

<p>It is, to say the least, illogical to admit that there is a hidden thought
in the literary work of a race perhaps ethnologically different from our
own; and then, because it is utterly unintelligible to us whose spiritual
development during the several thousand intervening years has bifurcated
into quite a contrary direction—deny that it has any sense in it at all.
But this is precisely what, with all due respect for erudition, Professor
Max Müller and his school do in this instance, at least. First of all, we
are told that, albeit cautiously and with some effort, yet we may still
walk in the footsteps of these authors of the <cite>Vedas</cite>. “We shall feel that
we are brought face to face and mind to mind with men yet intelligible
to us <em>after we have freed ourselves from our modern conceits</em>. We shall
not succeed always; words, verses, nay whole hymns in the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>,
will and must remain to us a dead letter.... For, with a few exceptions
... the whole world of the Vedic ideas is so entirely beyond our
own intellectual horizon, that instead of translating, we can as yet only
guess and
 <span class="lock">combine.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_818" id="FNanchor_818">[818]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, to leave us in no possible doubt as to the true value of his
words, the learned scholar, in another passage, expresses his opinion on
these same Vedas (with one exception) thus: “The only important, the
only real Veda, is the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>—the other so-called <cite>Vedas</cite> deserve the
name of <cite>Veda</cite> no more than the <cite>Talmud</cite> deserves the name of <cite>Bible</cite>.
Professor Müller rejects them as unworthy of the attention of any one,
and, as we understand it, on the ground that they contain chiefly “sacrificial
formulas, charms, and
 <span class="lock">incantations.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_819" id="FNanchor_819">[819]</a></span></p>

<p>And now, a very natural question: Are any of our scholars prepared
to demonstrate that, so far, they are intimately acquainted with the hidden
sense of these perfectly absurd “sacrificial formulas, charms, and incantations”
and magic nonsense of <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>? We believe not, and our
doubt is based on the confession of Professor Müller himself, just quoted.
If “the whole world of the Vedic ideas [the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> cannot be included

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>

alone in this <em>world</em>, we suppose] is so entirely beyond our own [the scientists’]
intellectual horizon that, instead of translating, we can as yet only
guess and combine;” and the <i>Yagur-Veda</i>, <i>Sama-Veda</i>, and <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>
are “childish and
 <span class="lock">foolish;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_820" id="FNanchor_820">[820]</a></span>
 and the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, the <i>Sûtras Yâska</i>, and
<i>Sâyana</i>, “though <i>nearest in time</i> to the hymns of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>, indulge
in the most frivolous and ill-judged interpretations,” how can either himself
or any other scholar form any adequate opinion of either of them?
If, again, the authors of the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, the nearest in time to the Vedic
hymns, were already incompetent to offer anything better than “ill-judged
interpretations,” then at what period of history, where, and by whom,
were written these grandiose poems, whose mystical sense has died with
their generations? Are we, then, so wrong in affirming that if sacred
texts are found in Egypt to have become—even to the priestly scribes of
4,000 years ago—wholly
 <span class="lock">unintelligible,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_821" id="FNanchor_821">[821]</a></span>
 and the <cite>Brahmanas</cite> offer but
“childish and foolish” interpretations of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>, at least as far
back as that, then, 1st, both the Egyptian and Hindu religious philosophies
are of an untold antiquity, far antedating ages cautiously assigned them
by our students of comparative mythology; and, <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr>, the claims of ancient
priests of Egypt and modern Brahmans, as to their age, are, after all,
correct.</p>

<p>We can never admit that the three other <cite>Vedas</cite> are less worthy of
their name than the Rig-hymns, or that the <cite>Talmud</cite> and the <cite>Kabala</cite> are
so inferior to the <cite>Bible</cite>. The very name of the <cite>Vedas</cite> (the literal meaning
of which is <em>knowledge</em> or <em>wisdom</em>) shows them to belong to the literature
of those men who, in every country, language, and age, have been spoken
of as “those who know.” In Sanscrit the third person singular is <i>véda</i>
(he knows), and the plural is <i>vidá</i> (they know). This word is synonymous
with the Greek θεοσέβεια which Plato uses when speaking of the
<i>wise</i>—the magicians; and with the Hebrew Hakamin, חכמים (wise
men). Reject the <cite>Talmud</cite> and its old predecessor the <cite>Kabala</cite>, and it
will be simply impossible ever to render correctly one word of that <cite>Bible</cite>
so much extolled at their expense. But then it is, perhaps, just what its
partisans are working for. To banish the <cite>Brahmanas</cite> is to fling away the
key that unlocks the door of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>. The <em>literal</em> interpretation of
the <cite>Bible</cite> has already borne its fruits; with the <cite>Vedas</cite> and the Sanscrit
sacred books in general it will be just the same, with this difference, that
the absurd interpretation of the <cite>Bible</cite> has received a time-honored right of
eminent domain in the department of the ridiculous; and will find its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416">416</a></span>

supporters, against light and against proof. As to the “heathen” literature,
after a few more years of unsuccessful attempts at interpretation, its
religious meaning will be relegated to the limbo of exploded superstitions,
and people will hear no more of it.</p>

<p>We beg to be clearly understood before we are blamed and criticised for
the above remarks. The vast learning of the celebrated Oxford professor
can hardly be questioned by his very enemies, yet we have a right to regret
his precipitancy to condemn that which he himself confesses “entirely
beyond our own intellectual horizon.” Even in what he considers a ridiculous
blunder on the part of the author of the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, other more spiritually-disposed
persons may see quite the reverse. “<em>Who</em> is the greatest
of the gods? Who shall first be praised by our songs?” says an ancient
Rishi of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>; mistaking (as <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> M. imagines) the interrogative
pronoun “Who” for some divine name. Says the Professor: “A place is
allotted in the sacrificial invocations to a god ‘Who,’ and hymns addressed
to him are called ‘Whoish hymns.’” And is a god “Who” less natural as
a term than a god “I am?” or “Whoish” hymns less reverential than
“I-amish” psalms? And who can prove that this is really a blunder, and
not a premeditated expression? Is it so impossible to believe that the
strange term was precisely due to a reverential awe which made the poet
hesitate before giving a name, as form to that which is justly considered as
the highest abstraction of metaphysical ideals—God? Or that the same
feeling made the commentator who came after him to pause and so leave
the work of anthropomorphizing the “Unknown,” the “<span class="smcap">Who</span>,” to future
human conception? “These early poets thought more for themselves—than
for others,” remarks Max Müller himself. “They sought rather, in
their language, to be true to their own thought than to please the imagination
of their
 <span class="lock">hearers.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_822" id="FNanchor_822">[822]</a></span>
 Unfortunately it is this very thought which
awakes no responsive echo in the minds of our philologists.</p>

<p>Farther, we read the sound advice to students of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> hymns,
to collect, collate, sift, and reject. “Let him study the commentaries,
the <i>Sûtras</i>, the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, and even later works, in order to exhaust
all the sources from which information can be derived. He [the scholar]
<em>must not despise the traditions of the Brahmans</em>, even where their misconceptions
... are palpable.... Not a corner in the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, the
<i>Sûtras</i>, <i>Yâska</i>, and <i>Sâyana</i>, should be left unexplored <em>before we propose
a rendering of our own</em>.... When the scholar has done his work, the
poet and philosopher must take it up and finish
 <span class="lock">it.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_823" id="FNanchor_823">[823]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor chance for a “philosopher” to step into the shoes of a learned

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>

philologist and presume to correct <em>his</em> errors! We would like to see
what sort of a reception the most learned Hindu scholar in India would
have from the educated public of Europe and America, if he should undertake
to correct a savant, after he had sifted, accepted, rejected,
explained, and declared what was good, and what “absurd and childish”
in the sacred books of his forefathers. That which would finally be declared
“Brahmanic misconceptions,” by the conclave of European and
especially German savants, would be as little likely to be reconsidered at
the appeal of the most erudite pundit of Benares or Ceylon, as the interpretation
of Jewish Scripture by Maimonides and Philo-Judæus, by Christians
after the Councils of the Church had accepted the mistranslations
and explanations of Irenæus and Eusebius. What pundit, or native
philosopher of India should know his ancestral language, religion, or
philosophy as well as an Englishman or a German? Or why should a
Hindu be more suffered to expound Brahmanism, than a Rabbinical
scholar to interpret Judaism or the Isaïan prophecies? Safer, and far
more trustworthy translators can be had nearer home. Nevertheless, let
us still hope that we may find at last, even though it be in the dim future,
a European philosopher to sift the sacred books of the wisdom-religion,
and not be contradicted by every other of his class.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, unmindful of any alleged authorities, let us try to sift for
ourselves a few of these myths of old. We will search for an explanation
within the popular interpretation, and feel our way with the help of the
magic lamp of Trismegistus—the mysterious number <em>seven</em>. There
must have been some reason why this figure was universally accepted
as a mystic calculation. With every ancient people, the Creator, or
Demiurge, was placed over the seventh heaven. “And were I to touch
upon the initiation into our sacred Mysteries,” says Emperor Julian,
the kabalist, “which the Chaldean bacchised respecting the <em>seven-rayed
God, lifting up the souls through Him</em>, I should say things unknown,
and <em>very unknown to the rabble</em>, but well known to the <em>blessed</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Theurgists</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_824" id="FNanchor_824">[824]</a></span>
 In <i>Lydus</i> it is said that “The Chaldeans call the God
IAO, and <span class="smcap">Sabaoth</span> he is often called, <em>as He</em> who is over the seven orbits
(heavens, or spheres), that is the
 <span class="lock">Demiurge.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_825" id="FNanchor_825">[825]</a></span></p>

<p>One must consult the Pythagoreans and Kabalists to learn the potentiality
of this number. Exoterically the seven rays of the solar
spectrum are represented concretely in the seven-rayed god Heptaktis.
These seven rays epitomized into <span class="allsmcap">THREE</span> primary rays, namely, the red,
blue, and yellow, form the solar trinity, and typify respectively spirit-matter

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>

and spirit-essence. Science has also reduced of late the seven
rays to three primary ones, thus corroborating the scientific conception
of the ancients of at least one of the visible manifestations of the invisible
deity, and the seven divided into a quaternary and a trinity.</p>

<p>The Pythagoreans called the number seven the vehicle of life, as it
contained body and soul. They explained it by saying, that the human
body consisted of four principal elements, and that the soul is triple, comprising
reason, passion, and desire. The ineffable <span class="smcap">Word</span> was considered
the <em>Seventh</em> and highest of all, for there are six minor substitutes, each
belonging to a degree of initiation. The Jews borrowed their Sabbath from
the ancients, who called it <em>Saturn’s</em> day and deemed it unlucky, and not
the latter from the Israelites when Christianized. The people of India,
Arabia, Syria, and Egypt observed weeks of seven days; and the Romans
learned the hebdomadal method from these foreign countries when they
became subject to the Empire. Still it was not until the fourth century
that the Roman kalends, nones, and ides were abandoned, and weeks
substituted in their place; and the astronomical names of the days, such
as <i lang="la">dies Solis</i> (day of the Sun), <i lang="la">dies Lunæ</i> (day of the Moon), <i lang="la">dies
Martis</i> (day of Mars); <i lang="la">dies Mercurii</i> (day of Mercury), <i lang="la">dies Jovis</i> (day
of Jupiter), <i lang="la">dies Veneris</i> (day of Venus), and <i lang="la">dies Saturni</i> (day of Saturn),
prove that it was not from the Jews that the week of seven days
was adopted. Before we examine this number kabalistically, we propose
to analyse it from the standpoint of the Judaico-Christian Sabbath.</p>

<p>When Moses instituted the <i>yom shaba</i>, or <i>Shebang</i> (Shabbath), the
allegory of the Lord God resting from his work of creation on the seventh
day was but a <em>cloak</em>, or, as the <cite>Sohar</cite> expresses it, a screen, to hide the
true meaning.</p>

<p>The Jews reckoned then, as they do now, their days by number, as, day
the <i>first</i>; day the second; and so on; <i>yom ahad</i>; <i>yom sheni</i>; <i>yom
shelisho</i>; <i>yom rebis</i>; <i>yom shamishi</i>; <i>yom shishehi</i>; yom <span class="allsmcap">SHABA</span>.</p>

<p>“The Hebrew <i>seven</i> שבע, consisting of three letters, S. B. O., has more
than one meaning. First of all, it means <em>age</em> or cycle, Shab-ang; Sabbath שבע
can be translated <i>old age</i>, as well as <em>rest</em>, and in the old Coptic,
<i>Sabe</i> means <i>wisdom</i>, learning. Modern archæologists have found that as
in Hebrew <i>Sab</i> שב also means <em>gray-headed</em>, and that therefore the <i>Saba</i>-day
was the day on which the “gray-headed men, or ‘aged fathers’ of a
tribe, were in the habit of assembling for councils or
 <span class="lock">sacrifices.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_826" id="FNanchor_826">[826]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thus, the week of six days and the seventh, the <i>Saba</i> or <i>Sapta</i>-day
period, is of the highest antiquity. The observance of the lunar festivals in
India, shows that that nation held hebdomadal meetings as well. With

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>

every new quarter the moon brings changes in the atmosphere, hence
certain changes are also produced throughout the whole of our universe,
of which the meteorological ones are the most insignificant. On this day
of the <em>seventh</em> and most powerful of the prismatic days, the adepts of the
“Secret Science” meet as they met thousands of years ago, to become
the agents of the occult powers of nature (emanations of the working
God), and commune with the invisible worlds. It is in this observance of
the seventh day by the old sages—not as the resting day of the Deity,
but because they had penetrated into its occult power, that lies the
profound veneration of all the heathen philosophers for the number
<em>seven</em> which they term the “venerable,” the sacred number. The Pythagorean
<i>Tetraktis</i>, revered by the Platonists, was the <em>square</em> placed
below the <em>triangle</em>; the latter, or the Trinity embodying the invisible
<i>Monad</i>—the unity, and deemed too sacred to be pronounced except
within the walls of a Sanctuary.</p>

<p>The ascetic observance of the Christian Sabbath by Protestants is
pure religious tyranny, and does more harm, we fear, than good. It really
dates only from the enactment (in 1678) of the 29th of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>,
which prohibited any “tradesman, artificer, workman, laborer, or other
person,” to “do or exercise any worldly labor, etc., etc., upon the Lord’s
day.” The Puritans carried this thing to extremes, apparently to mark
their hatred of Catholicism, both Roman and Episcopal. That it was no
part of the plan of Jesus that such a day should be set apart, is evident
not only from his words but acts. It was not observed by the early
Christians.</p>

<p>When Trypho, <em>the Jew</em>, reproached the Christians <em>for not having a
Sabbath</em>, what does the martyr answer him? “The new law will have
you keep a perpetual Sabbath. You, when <em>you have passed a day in
idleness, think you are religious</em>. The Lord is not pleased with such
things as these. If any be guilty of <em>perjury or fraud</em>, let him reform; <em>if
he be an adulterer</em>, let him repent; and <em>he will then have kept the kind of
Sabbath truly pleasing to God</em>.... The elements are never idle, and keep
no Sabbath. There was no need of the observance of Sabbaths before
Moses, neither now is there any need of them after Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>The <i>Heptaktis</i> is not the Supreme Cause, but simply an emanation
from <em>Him</em>—the first visible manifestation of the Unrevealed Power.
“His Divine <em>Breath</em>, which, violently breaking forth, condensed itself,
shining with radiance until it evolved into Light, and so became cognizant
to external sense,” says John
 <span class="lock">Reuchlin.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_827" id="FNanchor_827">[827]</a></span>
 This is the emanation of the
Highest, the Demiurge, a multiplicity in a <em>unity</em>, the <em>Elohim</em>, whom we

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>

see <em>creating</em> our world, or rather fashioning it, in six days, and resting
on the <em>seventh</em>. And who are these <em>Elohim</em> but the euhemerized powers
of nature, the faithful manifested servants, the laws of Him who is
immutable law and harmony Himself?</p>

<p>They remain over the seventh heaven (or spiritual world), for it is
they who, according to the kabalists, formed in succession the six
material worlds, or rather, attempts at worlds, that preceded our own,
which, they say, is the <em>seventh</em>. If, in laying aside the metaphysico-spiritual
conception, we give our attention but to the religio-scientific problem
of creation in “six days,” over which our best biblical scholars have
vainly pondered so long, we might, perchance, be on the way to the true
idea underlying the allegory. The ancients were philosophers, consistent
in all things. Hence, they taught that each of these departed worlds,
having performed its physical evolution, and reached—through birth,
growth, maturity, old age, and death—the end of its cycle, had returned
to its primitive subjective form of a <em>spiritual</em> earth. Thereafter it had to
serve through all eternity as the dwelling of those who had lived on it as
men, and even animals, but were now spirits. This idea, were it even
as incapable of exact demonstration as that of our theologians relating
to Paradise, is, at least, a trifle more philosophical.</p>

<p>As well as man, and every other living thing upon it, our planet has
had its spiritual and physical evolution. From an impalpable ideal
<em>thought</em> under the creative Will of Him of whom we know nothing, and
but dimly conceive in imagination, this globe became fluidic and <em>semi</em>-spiritual,
then condensed itself more and more, until its physical development—matter,
the tempting demon—compelled it to try its own creative
faculty. <cite>Matter</cite> defied <span class="smcap">Spirit</span>, and the earth, too, had its “Fall.”
The allegorical curse under which it labors, is that it only <em>procreates</em>,
it does not <em>create</em>. Our physical planet is but the handmaiden, or rather
the maid-of-all-work, of the spirit, its master. “Cursed be the ground
... thorns and thistles shall it bring,” the Elohim are made to say.
“In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children.” The Elohim say this both
to the ground and the woman. And this curse will last until the minutest
particle of matter on earth shall have outlived its days, until every grain
of dust has, by gradual transformation through evolution, become a
constituent part of a “living soul,” and, until the latter shall reascend
the cyclic arc, and finally stand—its own <i>Metatron</i>, or Redeeming
Spirit—at the foot of the upper step of the spiritual worlds, as at the
first hour of its emanation. Beyond that lies the great “Deep”—<span class="smcap">A
Mystery</span>!</p>

<p>It must be remembered that every cosmogony has a <em>trinity</em> of workers
at its head—Father, spirit; Mother, nature, or matter; and the manifested

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span>

universe, the Son or result of the two. The universe, also, as well
as each planet which it comprehends, passes through <em>four</em> ages, like man
himself. All have their infancy, youth, maturity, and old age, and
these four added to the other three make the sacred seven again.</p>

<p>The introductory chapters of <cite>Genesis</cite> were never meant to present
even a remote allegory of the creation of <em>our</em> earth. They embrace
(chapter <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>) a metaphysical conception of some indefinite period in
the eternity, when successive attempts were being made by the law of
evolution at the formation of universes. This idea is plainly stated in
the <cite>Sohar</cite>: “There were old worlds, which perished as soon as they
came into existence, were formless, and were called <i>sparks</i>. Thus, the
smith, when hammering the iron, lets the sparks fly in all directions.
The sparks are the primordial worlds which could not continue, because
the <i>Sacred Aged</i> (Sephira) had not as yet assumed its form (of androgyne
or opposite sexes) of king and queen (Sephira and Kadmon) and the
Master was not yet at his
 <span class="lock">work.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_828" id="FNanchor_828">[828]</a></span></p>

<p>The six periods or “days” of <cite>Genesis</cite> refer to the same metaphysical
belief. Five such ineffectual attempts were made by the <i>Elohim</i>, but
the sixth resulted in worlds like our own (<i>i.e.</i>, all the planets and most of
the stars are worlds, and inhabited, though not like our earth). Having
formed this world at last in the sixth period, the Elohim rested in the
<em>seventh</em>. Thus the “Holy One,” when he created the present world,
said: “This pleases me; the previous ones did not please
 <span class="lock">me.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_829" id="FNanchor_829">[829]</a></span>
 And
the Elohim “saw everything that he had made, and behold <em>it was</em> very
good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth <em>day</em>.”—<cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr></p>

<p>The reader will remember that in Chapter <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> an explanation was
given of the “day” and “night” of Brahma. The former represents a
certain period of cosmical activity, the latter an equal one of cosmical
repose. In the one, worlds are being evolved, and passing through their
allotted four ages of existence; in the latter the “inbreathing” of Brahma
reverses the tendency of the natural forces; everything visible becomes
gradually dispersed; chaos comes; and a long night of repose reinvigorates
the cosmos for its next term of evolution. In the morning of one

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>

of these “days” the formative processes are gradually reaching their
climax of activity; in the evening imperceptibly diminishing the same
until the <i>pralaya</i> arrives, and with it “<em>night</em>.” One such morning and
evening do, in fact, constitute a cosmic day; and it was a “day of
Brahma” that the kabalistic author of <cite>Genesis</cite> had in mind each time
when he said: “And the evening and the morning were the first (or fifth
or sixth, or any other) <em>day</em>.” Six days of gradual evolution, one of repose,
and then—evening! Since the first appearance of man on <em>our</em> earth there
has been an eternal Sabbath or rest for the Demiurge.</p>

<p>The cosmogonical speculations of the first six chapters of <cite>Genesis</cite>
are shown in the races of “sons of God,” “giants,” etc., of chapter <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr>
Properly speaking, the story of the formation of our earth, or “creation,”
as it is very improperly called, begins with the rescue of Noah
from the deluge. The Chaldeo-Babylonian tablets recently translated by
George Smith leave no doubt of that in the minds of those who read the
inscriptions esoterically. Ishtar, the great goddess, speaks in column <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>
of the destruction of the <em>sixth</em> world and the appearance of the seventh,
thus:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Six</span> <em>days</em> and <em>nights</em> the wind, deluge, and storm overwhelmed.</p>

<p>“On the <em>seventh</em> day, in its course was calmed the storm, and all the
deluge,</p>

<p>“which had destroyed like an
 <span class="lock">earthquake,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_830" id="FNanchor_830">[830]</a></span></p>

<p>“quieted. The sea he caused to dry, and the wind and deluge
ended....</p>

<p>“I perceived the shore at the boundary of the sea....</p>

<p>“to the country of Nizir went the ship (argha, or the moon).</p>

<p>“the mountain of Nizir stopped the ship....</p>

<p>“the <em>first</em> day, and the <em>second</em> day, the mountain of Nizir the same.</p>

<p>“the <em>fifth</em> and the <em>sixth</em>, the mountain of Nizir the same.</p>

<p>“on the <em>seventh</em> day, in the course of it</p>

<p>“I sent forth a dove, and it left. The dove went and turned, and
... the raven went ... and did not return.</p>

<p>“I built an altar on the peak of the mountain.</p>

<p>“by <em>seven</em> herbs I cut, at the bottom of them I placed reeds, pines,
and simgar....</p>

<p>“the gods like flies over the sacrifice gathered.</p>

<p>“from of old <em>also the great God</em> in his course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423">423</a></span>

“the great brightness (the sun) of Anu had
 <span class="lock">created.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_831" id="FNanchor_831">[831]</a></span>
 When the
glory of those gods the charm round my neck would not repel,” etc.</p>

<p>All this has a purely astronomical, magical, and esoteric relation. One
who reads these tablets will recognize at a glance the biblical account;
and judge, at the same time, how disfigured is the great Babylonian poem
by euhemeric personages—degraded from their exalted positions of gods
into simple patriarchs. Space prevents our entering fully into this biblical
travesty of the Chaldean allegories. We shall therefore but remind
the reader that by the confession of the most unwilling witnesses—such
as Lenormant, first the inventor and then champion of the Akkadians—the
Chaldeo-Babylonian triad placed under Ilon, the <em>unrevealed</em> deity, is
composed of Anu, Nuah, and Bel. Anu is the primordial chaos, the
god time and world at once, χρόνος and κόσμος, the uncreated matter
issued from the one and fundamental principle of all things. As to
<i>Nuah</i>, he is, according to the same Orientalist:</p>

<p>“... the intelligence, we will willingly say the <i>verbum</i>, which animates
and fecundates matter, which penetrates the universe, directs and makes
it live; and at the same time Nuah is the king of the <em>humid principle;
the Spirit moving on the waters</em>.”</p>

<p>Is not this evident? Nuah is Noah, <em>floating on the waters</em>, in his
ark; the latter being the emblem of the argha, or moon, the feminine
principle; Noah is the “spirit” falling into matter. We find him as
soon as he descends upon the earth, planting a vineyard, drinking of the
wine, and getting drunk on it; <i>i.e.</i>, the pure spirit becoming intoxicated
as soon as it is finally imprisoned in matter. The seventh chapter
of <cite>Genesis</cite> is but another version of the first. Thus, while the latter
reads: “... and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the
spirit (of God) moved upon the face of the waters,” in chapter
seventh, it is said: “... and the waters prevailed ... and the ark
went (with Noah—the spirit) upon the face of the waters.” Thus Noah,
if the Chaldean Nuah, is the spirit vivifying <em>matter</em>, chaos represented

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>

by the deep or waters of the flood. In the Babylonian legend it is Istar
(Astoreth, the moon) which is shut up in the ark, and sends out a dove
(emblem of Venus and other lunar goddesses) in search of dry land.
And whereas in the Semitic tablets it is Xisuthrus or Hasisadra who is
“translated to the company of the gods for his piety,” in the <cite>Bible</cite> it is
Enoch who walks with, and being taken up by God, “was no more.”</p>

<p>The successive existence of an incalculable number of worlds before
the subsequent evolution of our own, was believed and taught by all the
ancient peoples. The punishment of the Christians for despoiling the
Jews of their records and refusing the true key to them began from
the earliest centuries. And thus is it that we find the holy Fathers of the
Church laboring through an impossible chronology and the absurdities
of literal interpretation, while the learned rabbis were perfectly aware of
the real significance of their allegories. So not only in the <cite>Sohar</cite>, but
also in other kabalistic works accepted by Talmudists, such as <cite>Midrash
Berasheth</cite>, or the universal <cite>Genesis</cite>, which, with the <cite>Merkaba</cite> (the
chariot of Ezekiel), composes the <cite>Kabala</cite>, may be found the doctrine of
a whole series of worlds evolving out of the chaos, and being destroyed
in succession.</p>

<p>The Hindu doctrines teach of two <i>Pralayas</i> or dissolutions; one
universal, the Maha-Pralaya, the other partial, or the minor Pralaya. This
does not relate to the universal dissolution which occurs at the end of
every “Day of Brahma,” but to the geological cataclysms at the end of
every minor cycle of our globe. This historical and purely local deluge
of Central Asia, the traditions of which can be traced in every country,
and which, according to Bunsen, happened about the year 10,000 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
had naught to do with the mythical Noah, or Nuah. A partial cataclysm
occurs at the close of every “age” of the world, they say, which
does not destroy the latter, but only changes its general appearance.
New races of men and animals and a new flora evolve from the dissolution
of the precedent ones.</p>

<p>The allegories of the “fall of man” and the “deluge,” are the two
most important features of the <cite>Pentateuch</cite>. They are, so to say, the
Alpha and Omega, the highest and the lowest keys of the scale of harmony
on which resounds the majestic hymns of the creation of mankind;
for they discover to him who questions the <i>Zura</i> (figurative <i>Gemantria</i>),
the process of man’s evolution from the highest spiritual entity unto the
lowest physical—the post-diluvian man, as in the Egyptian hieroglyphics,
every sign of the picture writing which cannot be made to fit within a
certain circumscribed geometrical figure may be rejected as only intended
by the sacred hierogrammatist for a premeditated blind—so many of
the details in the <cite>Bible</cite> must be treated on the same principle, that portion

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425">425</a></span>

only being accepted which answers to the numerical methods taught
in the <cite>Kabala</cite>.</p>

<p>The deluge appears in the Hindu books only as a tradition. It
claims no sacred character, and we find it but in the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite>, the
<cite>Puranas</cite>, and still earlier in the <cite>Satapatha</cite>, one of the latest <cite>Brahmanas</cite>.
It is more than probable that Moses, or whoever wrote for him, used
these accounts as the basis of his own purposely disfigured allegory, adding
to it moreover the Chaldean Berosian narrative. In <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite>, we
recognize Nimrod under the name of <i>King Daytha</i>. The origin of the
Grecian fable of the Titans scaling Olympus, and the other of the builders
of the Tower of Babel who seek to reach heaven, is shown in the impious
<i>Daytha</i>, who sends imprecations against heaven’s thunder, and threatens
to conquer heaven itself with his mighty warriors, thereby bringing upon
humanity the wrath of Brahma. “The Lord then resolved,” says the
text, “to chastise his creatures with a terrible punishment which should
serve as a warning to survivors, and to their descendants.”</p>

<p><i>Vaivasvata</i> (who in the <cite>Bible</cite> becomes Noah) saves a little fish, which
turns out to be an <i>avatar</i> of Vishnu. The fish warns that just man that
the globe is about to be submerged, that all that inhabit it must perish,
and orders him to construct a vessel in which he shall embark, with all
his family. When the ship is ready, and <i>Vaivasvata</i> has shut up in it
with his family <i>the seeds of plants and pairs of all animals</i>, and the rain
begins to fall, a gigantic fish, armed with a horn, places itself at the head
of the ark. The holy man, following its orders, attaches a cable to this
horn, and the fish guides the ship safely through the raging elements. In
the Hindu tradition the number of days during which the deluge lasted
<em>agrees exactly with that of the Mosaic account</em>. When the elements
were calmed, the fish landed the ark on the summit of the Himalayas.</p>

<p>This fable is considered by many orthodox commentators to have
been borrowed from the Mosaic

 But surely if such a <em>universal</em>
cataclysm had ever taken place within man’s memory, some of the
monuments of the Egyptians, of which many are of such a tremendous
antiquity, would have recorded that occurrence, coupled with that of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>

disgrace of Ham, Canaan, and Mizraim, their alleged ancestors. But, till
now, there has not been found the remotest allusion to such a calamity,
although Mizraim certainly belongs to the first generation after the
deluge, if not actually an antediluvian himself. On the other hand the
Chaldeans preserved the tradition, as we find Berosus testifying to it, and
the ancient Hindus possess the legend as given above. Now, there is
but one explanation of the extraordinary fact that of two contemporary
and civilized nations like Egypt and Chaldea, one has preserved no tradition
of it whatever, although it was the most directly interested in the
occurrence—if we credit the <cite>Bible</cite>—and the other has. The deluge
noticed in the <cite>Bible</cite>, in one of the <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, and in the Berosus <cite>Fragment</cite>,
relates to the partial flood which, about 10,000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, according
to Bunsen, and according to the Brahmanical computations of the Zodiac
also changed the whole face of Central
 <span class="lock">Asia.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_833" id="FNanchor_833">[833]</a></span>
 Thus the Babylonians and
the Chaldeans might have learned of it from their mysterious guests, christened
by some Assyriologists Akkadians, or what is still more probable
they, themselves, perhaps, were the descendants of those who had dwelt
in the submerged localities. The Jews had the tale from the latter as
they had everything else; the Brahmans may have recorded the traditions
of the lands which they first invaded, and had perhaps inhabited before
they possessed themselves of the Punjâb. But the Egyptians, whose first
settlers had evidently come from Southern India, had less reason to
record the cataclysm, since it had perhaps never affected them except
indirectly, as the flood was limited to Central Asia.</p>

<p>Burnouf, noticing the fact that the story of the deluge is found only
in one of the most modern <cite>Brahmanas</cite>, also thinks that it might have
been borrowed by the Hindus from the Semitic nations. Against such
an assumption are ranged all the traditions and customs of the Hindus.
The Aryans, and especially the Brahmans, never borrowed anything at all
from the Semitists, and here we are corroborated by one of those “unwilling
witnesses,” as Higgins calls the partisans of Jehovah and <cite>Bible</cite>. “I have
never seen anything in the history of the Egyptians and Jews,” writes
Abbé Dubois, forty years a resident of India, “that would induce me
to believe that either of these nations, or any other on the face of the
earth, have been established earlier than the Hindus, and particularly the
Brahmans; so I cannot be induced to believe that the latter have drawn
their rites from foreign nations. On the contrary, I infer that they have
drawn them from an original source of their own. Whoever knows anything
of the spirit and character of the Brahmans, their stateliness, their
pride, and extreme vanity, their distance, and sovereign contempt for

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>

everything that is foreign, and of which they cannot boast to have been
the inventors, will agree with me that such a people cannot have consented
to draw their customs and rules of conduct from an alien
 <span class="lock">country.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_834" id="FNanchor_834">[834]</a></span></p>

<p>This fable which mentions the earliest avatar—the Matsya—relates to
another yuga than our own, that of the first appearance of animal life; perchance,
who knows, to the Devonian age of our geologists? It certainly
answers better to the latter than the year 2348 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>! Apart from this, the
very absence of all mention of the deluge from the oldest books of
the Hindus suggests a powerful argument when we are left utterly to
inferences as in this case. “The <cite>Vedas</cite> and <cite>Manu</cite>,” says Jacolliot,
“those monuments of the old Asiatic thought, existed far earlier than
the diluvian period; <em>this is an incontrovertible fact, having all the value
of an historical truth</em>, for, besides the tradition which shows Vishnu himself
as saving the <cite>Vedas</cite> from the deluge—a tradition which, notwithstanding
its legendary form, must certainly rest upon a real fact—it has been
remarked that neither of these sacred books mention the cataclysm,
while the <i>Pûranas</i> and the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite>, and a great number of other
more recent works, describe it with the minutest detail, <em>which is a proof
of the priority of the former</em>. The <cite>Vedas</cite> certainly would never have
failed to contain a few hymns on the terrible disaster which, of all other
natural manifestations, must have struck the imagination of the people
who witnessed it.”</p>

<p>“Neither would Manu, who gives us a complete narrative of the
creation, with a chronology from the divine and heroical ages, down to
the appearance of man on earth—have passed in silence an event of
such importance.” <cite>Manu</cite> (book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, sloka 35), gives the names of ten
eminent saints whom he calls pradjâpatis (more correctly <i>pragâpatis</i>),
in whom the Brahman theologians see prophets, ancestors of the human
race, and the Pundits simply consider as ten powerful kings who lived in
the Krita-yug, or the age of good (the golden age of the Greeks).</p>

<p>The last of these pragâpatis is Brighou.</p>

<p>“Enumerating the succession of these eminent beings who, according
to Manu, have governed the world, the old Brahmanical legislator
names as descending from Brighou: Swârotchica, Ottami, Tamasa,
Raivata, the glorious Tchâkchoucha, and the son of Vivasvat, every one
of the six having made himself worthy of the title of Manu (divine legislator),
a title which had equally belonged to the Pradjâpatis, and every
great personage of primitive India. The genealogy stops at this name.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, according to the <cite>Pûranas</cite> and the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite> it was under
a descendant of this son of Vivaswata, named Vaivaswata that occurred
the great cataclysm, the remembrance of which, as will be seen, has
passed into a tradition, and been carried by emigration into all the countries
of the East and West which India has colonized since then....</p>

<p>“The genealogy given by Manu stopping, as we have seen, at Vivaswata,
it follows that this work (of Manu) knew nothing either of Vivaswata
or the
 <span class="lock">deluge.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_835" id="FNanchor_835">[835]</a></span></p>

<p>The argument is unanswerable; and we commend it to those official
scientists, who, to please the clergy, dispute every fact proving the
tremendous antiquity of the <cite>Vedas</cite> and <cite>Manu</cite>. Colonel Vans Kennedy
has long since declared that Babylonia was, from her origin, the seat of
<em>Sanscrit</em> literature and Brahman learning. And how or why should the
Brahmans have penetrated there, unless it was as the result of intestine
wars and emigration from India? The fullest account of the deluge is
found in the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite> of Vedavyasa, a poem in honor of the astrological
allegories on the wars between the Solar and the Lunar races. One
of the versions states that Vivaswata became the father of all the nations
of the earth through his own progeny, and this is the form adopted for
the Noachian story; the other states that—like Deukalion and Pyrrha—he
had but to throw pebbles into the ilus left by the retiring waves of the
flood, to produce men at will. These two versions—one Hebrew, the
other Greek—allow us no choice. We must either believe that the Hindus
borrowed from pagan Greeks as well as from monotheistic Jews, or—what
is far more probable—that the versions of both of these nations are
derived from the Vedic literature through the Babylonians.</p>

<p>History tells us of the stream of immigration across the Indus, and later
of its overflowing the Occident; and of populations of Hindu origin passing
from Asia Minor to colonize Greece. But history says not a single word of
the “chosen people,” or of Greek colonies having penetrated India earlier
than the 5th and 4th centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, when we first find vague traditions
that make some of the problematical <em>lost</em> tribes of Israel, take from
Babylon the route to India. But even were the story of the ten tribes to
find credence, and the tribes themselves be proved to have existed in
profane as well as in sacred history, this does not help the solution at all.
Colebrooke, Wilson, and other eminent Indianists show the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite>,
if not the <cite>Satapatha</cite>-brâhmana, in which the story is also given, as by far
antedating the age of Cyrus, hence, the possible time of the appearance
of any of the tribes of Israel in
 <span class="lock">India.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_836" id="FNanchor_836">[836]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>

Orientalists accord the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite> an antiquity of between twelve
and fifteen hundred years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; as to the Greek version it bears as little evidence
as the other, and the attempts of the Hellenists in this direction
have as signally failed. The story of the conquering army of Alexander
penetrating into Northern India, itself becomes more doubted every day.
No Hindu national record, not the slightest historical memento, throughout
the length and breadth of India offers the slightest trace of such an
invasion.</p>

<p>If even such <em>historical facts</em> are now found to have been all the while
fictions, what are we to think of narratives which bear on their very
face the stamp of invention? We cannot help sympathizing at heart
with Professor Müller when he remarks that it seems “blasphemy to
consider these fables of the heathen world as corrupted and misinterpreted
fragments of <em>divine</em> Revelation once granted to the whole race of
mankind.” Only, can this scholar be held perfectly impartial and fair to
both parties, unless he includes in the number of these fables those of
the <cite>Bible</cite>? And is the language of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> more <em>pure</em> or
<em>moral</em> than the books of the Brahmans? Or any fables of the <em>heathen</em>
world more blasphemous and ridiculous than Jehovah’s interview with
Moses (<cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="thirty-three">xxxiii.</abbr> 23)? Are any of the Pagan gods made to appear
more fiendish than the same Jehovah in a score of passages? If the
feelings of a pious Christian are shocked at the absurdities of Father
Kronos eating his children and maiming Uranos; or of Jupiter throwing
Vulcan down from heaven and breaking his leg; on the other hand he
cannot feel hurt if a <em>non</em>-Christian laughs at the idea of Jacob boxing with
the Creator, who “when he saw that <em>he prevailed not</em> against him,”
dislocated Jacob’s thigh, the patriarch still holding fast to God and not
allowing Him to go His way, notwithstanding His pleading.</p>

<p>Why should the story of Deukalion and Pyrrha, throwing stones behind
them, and thus creating the human race, be deemed more ridiculous
than that of Lot’s wife being changed into a pillar of salt, or of the
Almighty creating men <em>of clay</em> and then breathing the breath of life into
them? The choice between the latter mode of creation and that of the
Egyptian ram-horned god fabricating man on a potter’s wheel is hardly
perceptible. The story of Minerva, goddess of wisdom, ushered into existence
after a certain period of gestation in her father’s brain, is at least
suggestive and poetical, as an allegory. No ancient Greek was ever
burned for not accepting it literally; and, at all events, “heathen” fables

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>

in general are far less preposterous and blasphemous than those imposed
upon Christians, ever since the Church accepted the <cite>Old Testament</cite>, and
the Roman Catholic Church opened its register of thaumaturgical saints.</p>

<p>“Many of the natives of India,” continues Professor Müller, “confess
that their feelings revolt against the impurities attributed to the gods
by what they call their sacred writings; yet there are honest Brahmans
who will maintain that <em>these stories have a deeper meaning</em>; that immorality
being incompatible with a divine being, <em>a mystery</em> must be supposed
to be concealed in these time-hallowed fables, a mystery which an inquiring
and reverent mind may hope to fathom.”</p>

<p>This is precisely what the Christian clergy maintain in attempting to
explain the indecencies and incongruities of the <cite>Old Testament</cite>. Only,
instead of allowing the interpretation to those who have the key to these
seeming incongruities, they have assumed to themselves the office and
right, by <em>divine</em> proxy, to interpret these in their own way. They have
not only done that but have gradually deprived the Hebrew clergy of the
means to interpret their Scriptures as their fathers did; so that to find
among the Rabbis in the present century a well-versed kabalist, is quite
rare. The Jews have themselves forgotten the key! How could they
help it? Where are the original manuscripts? The oldest Hebrew
manuscript in existence is said to be the <cite>Bodleian Codex</cite>, which is not
older than between eight and nine hundred
 <span class="lock">years.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_837" id="FNanchor_837">[837]</a></span>
 The break between
Ezra and this <cite>Codex</cite> is thus fifteen centuries. In 1490 the Inquisition
<em>caused all the Hebrew Bibles to be burned</em>; and Torquemada alone destroyed
6,000 volumes at Salamanca. Except a few manuscripts of
the <cite>Tora Ketubim</cite> and <cite>Nebiim</cite>, used in the synagogues, and which are of
quite a recent date, we do not think there is one old manuscript in existence
which is not punctuated, hence—completely misinterpreted and
altered by the Masorets. Were it not for this timely invention of the
<i>Masorah</i>, no copy of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> could possibly be tolerated in our
century. It is well known that the Masorets while transcribing the oldest
manuscripts put themselves to task to take out, except in a few places
which they have probably overlooked, all the <em>immodest</em> words and put

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>

in places sentences of their own, often changing completely the sense of
the verse. “It is clear,” says Donaldson, “that the Masoretic school
at Tiberias were engaged in settling or unsettling the Hebrew text until
the final publication of the <i>Masorah</i> itself.” Therefore, had we but the
original texts—judging by the present copies of the <cite>Bible</cite> in our possession—it
would be really edifying to compare the <cite>Old Testament</cite> with the
<cite>Vedas</cite> and even with the Brahmanical books. We verily believe that no
faith, however blind, could stand before such an avalanche of crude impurities
and fables. If the latter are not only accepted but enforced
upon millions of civilized persons who find it respectable and edifying to
believe in them as <em>divine revelation</em>, why should we wonder that Brahmans
believe their books to be equally a <i>Sruti</i>, a revelation?</p>

<p>Let us thank the Masorets by all means, but let us study at the same
time both sides of the medal.</p>

<p>Legends, myths, allegories, symbols, if they but belong to the Hindu,
Chaldean, or Egyptian tradition, are thrown into the same heap of fiction.
Hardly are they honored with a superficial search into their possible
relations to astronomy or sexual emblems. The same myths—when
and because mutilated—are accepted as Sacred Scriptures, more—the
Word of God! Is this impartial history? Is this justice to either
the past, the present, or the future? “Ye cannot serve God and
Mammon,” said the Reformer, nineteen centuries ago. “Ye cannot
serve truth and public prejudice,” would be more applicable to our own
age. Yet our authorities pretend they serve the former.</p>

<p>There are few myths in any religious system but have an historical
as well as a scientific foundation. Myths, as Pococke ably expresses
it, “are now proved to be fables, just in proportion as we <em>misunderstand</em>
them; truths, in proportion as they were once <em>understood</em>. Our
ignorance it is which has made a myth of history; and our ignorance is
an Hellenic inheritance, much of it the result of Hellenic
 <span class="lock">vanity.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_838" id="FNanchor_838">[838]</a></span></p>

<p>Bunsen and Champollion have already shown that the Egyptian
sacred books are by far older than the oldest parts of the <cite>Book of Genesis</cite>.
And now a more careful research seems to warrant the suspicion—which
with us amounts to a certainty, that the laws of Moses are copies
from the code of the Brahmanic <cite>Manu</cite>. Thus, according to every
probability, Egypt owes her civilization, her civil institutions, and her
arts, to India. But against the latter assumption we have a whole army
of “authorities” arrayed, and what matters if the latter do deny the
fact at present? Sooner or later they will have to accept it, whether
they belong to the German or French school. Among, but not of those

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>

who so readily compromise between interest and conscience, there are
some fearless scholars, who may bring out to light incontrovertible facts.
Some twenty years since, Max Müller, in a letter to the Editor of the
London <cite>Times</cite>, April, 1857, maintained most vehemently that Nirvana
meant <i>annihilation</i>, in the fullest sense of the word. (See <cite>Chips</cite>, etc., <abbr title="volume one">vol.
i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 287, on the meaning of Nirvana.) But in 1869, in a lecture
before the general meeting of the Association of German Philologists at
Kiel, “he distinctly declares his belief that the nihilism attributed to
Buddha’s teaching forms no part of his doctrine, and that it is wholly
wrong to suppose that Nirvana means annihilation.” (Trübner’s <cite>American
and Oriental Literary Record</cite>, Oct. 16, 1869; also Inman’s
<cite>Ancient Faiths and Modern</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 128.) Yet if we mistake not, Professor
Müller was as much of an authority in 1857 as in 1869.</p>

<p>“It will be difficult to settle,” says (now) this great scholar,
“whether the <cite>Vedas</cite> is the oldest of books, and whether some of the
portions of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> may not be traced back to the same or
even an earlier date than the oldest hymns of the
 <span class="lock"><cite>Veda</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_839" id="FNanchor_839">[839]</a></span>
 But his
retraction about the Nirvana allows us a hope that he may yet change
his opinion on the question of <cite>Genesis</cite> likewise, so that the public may
have simultaneously the benefit of truth, and the sanction of one of
Europe’s greatest authorities.</p>

<p>It is well known how little the Orientalists have come to anything
like an agreement about the age of Zoroaster, and until this question is
settled, it would be safer perhaps to trust implicitly in the Brahmanical
calculations by the Zodiac, than to the opinions of scientists. Leaving
the profane horde of unrecognized scholars, those we mean who yet
wait their turn to be chosen for public worship as idols symbolical of
scientific leadership, where can we find, among the sanctioned authorities
of the day, two that agree as to this age? There’s Bunsen, who
places Zoroaster at Baktra, and the emigration of Baktrians to the
Indus at 3784 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_840" id="FNanchor_840">[840]</a>
    and the birth of Moses at
 <span class="lock">1392.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_841" id="FNanchor_841">[841]</a></span>
 Now it is rather
difficult to place Zoroaster anterior to the <cite>Vedas</cite>, considering that the
whole of his doctrine is that of the earlier <cite>Vedas</cite>. True, he remained
in Afghanistan for a period more or less problematical before crossing
into the Punjâb; but the <cite>Vedas</cite> were begun in the latter country. They
indicate the progress of the Hindus, as the <cite>Avesta</cite> that of the Iranians.
And there is Haug who assigns to the <i>Aitareya Brahmanam</i>—a
Brahmanical speculation and commentary upon the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> of a far

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>

later date than the <cite>Veda</cite> itself—between 1400 and 1200 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, while the
<cite>Vedas</cite> are placed by him between 2,000 and 2,400 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Max
Müller cautiously suggests certain difficulties in this chronological computation,
but still does not altogether deny
 <span class="lock">it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_842" id="FNanchor_842">[842]</a></span>
 Let it, however, be as
it may, and supposing that the <cite>Pentateuch</cite> was written by Moses himself—notwithstanding
that he would thereby be made to twice record
his own death—still, if Moses was born, as Bunsen finds, in 1392 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
the <cite>Pentateuch</cite> could not have been written, <em>before the Vedas</em>. Especially
if Zoroaster was born 3784 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> If, as Dr.
 <span class="lock">Haug<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_843" id="FNanchor_843">[843]</a></span>
 tells us, some
of the hymns of the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite> were written before Zoroaster accomplished
his schism, something like thirty-seven centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and Max
Müller says himself that “the Zoroastrians and their ancestors started
from India during the Vaidic period,” how can some of the portions of
the <cite>Old Testament</cite> be traced back to the same or even “an earlier date
than the oldest hymns of the <cite>Veda</cite>?”</p>

<p>It has generally been agreed among Orientalists that the Aryans, 3,000
years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, were still in the steppes east of the Caspian, and united.
Rawlinson <em>conjectures</em> that they “flowed east” from Armenia as a common
centre; while two kindred streams began to flow, one northward
over the Caucasus, and the other westward over Asia Minor and Europe.
He finds the Aryans, at a period anterior to the fifteenth century before
our era, “settled in the territory watered by the Upper Indus.” Thence
Vedic Aryans migrated to the Punjâb, and Zendic Aryans westward, establishing
the historical countries. But this, like the rest, is a hypothesis,
and only given as such.</p>

<p>Again, Rawlinson, evidently following Max Müller, says: “The
early history of the Aryans is for many ages an absolute blank.” But
many learned Brahmans, however, have declared that they found trace of
the existence of the <cite>Vedas</cite> as early as 2100 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>; and Sir William Jones,
taking for his guide the astronomical data, places the <cite>Yagur-Veda</cite> 1580
<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> This would be still “before Moses.”</p>

<p>It is upon the supposition that the Aryans did not leave Afghanistan
for the Punjâb prior to 1500 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> that Max Müller and other Oxford
savants have supposed that portions of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> may be traced
back to the same or even an earlier date than the oldest hymns of the
<cite>Veda</cite>. Therefore, until the Orientalists can show us the correct date at
which Zoroaster flourished, no authority can be regarded as better for the
ages of the <cite>Vedas</cite> than the Brahmans themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>

As it is a recognized fact that the Jews borrowed most of their laws
from the Egyptians, let us examine who were the Egyptians. In our
opinion—which is but a poor authority, of course—they were the ancient
Indians, and in our first volume we have quoted passages from the historian
Collouca-Batta that support such a theory. What we mean by
ancient India is the following:</p>

<p>No region on the map—except it be the ancient Scythia—is more
uncertainly defined than that which bore the designation of India. Æthiopia
is perhaps the only parallel. It was the home of the Cushite or
Hamitic races, and lay to the east of Babylonia. It was once the name
of Hindustan, when the dark races, worshippers of Bala-Mahadeva and
Bhavani-Mahidevi, were supreme in that country. The India of the early
sages appears to have been the region at the sources of the Oxus and
Jaxartes. Apollonius of Tyana crossed the Caucasus, or Hindu Kush,
where he met with a king who directed him to the abode of the sages—perhaps
the descendants of those whom Ammianus terms the “Brahmans
of Upper India,” and whom Hystaspes, the father of Darius (or more
probably Darius Hystaspes himself) visited; and, having been instructed
by them, infused their rites and ideas into the Magian observances. This
narrative about Apollonius seems to indicate Kashmere as the country
which he visited, and the <i>Nagas</i>—after their conversion to Buddhism—as
his teachers. At this time Aryan India did not extend beyond the
Punjâb.</p>

<p>To our notion, the most baffling impediment in the way of ethnological
progress has always been the triple progeny of Noah. In the attempt
to reconcile postdiluvian races with a genealogical descent from Shem,
Ham, and Japhet, the Christianesque Orientalists have set themselves a
task impossible of accomplishment. The biblical Noachian ark has been
a Procrustean bed to which they had to make everything fit. Attention
has therefore been diverted from veritable sources of information as
to the origin of man, and a purely local allegory mistaken for a historical
record emanating from an inspired source. Strange and unfortunate
choice! Out of all the sacred writings of all the branch nations, sprung
from the primitive stock of mankind, Christianity must choose for its guidance
the national records and scriptures of a people perhaps the least
spiritual of the human family—the Semitic. A branch that has never
been able to develop out of its numerous tongues a language capable of
embodying ideas of a moral and intellectual world; whose form of expression
and drift of thought could never soar higher than the purely sensual
and terrestrial figures of speech; whose literature has left nothing original,
nothing that was not borrowed from the Aryan thought; and whose
science and philosophy are utterly wanting in those noble features which

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span>

characterize the highly spiritual and metaphysical systems of the Indo-European
(Japetic) races.</p>

<p>Bunsen shows Khamism (the language of Egypt) as a very ancient
deposit from Western Asia, containing <em>the germs</em> of the Semitic, and thus
bearing “witness to the primitive cognate unity of the Semitic and Aryan
races.” We must remember, in this connection, that the peoples of Southwestern
and Western Asia, including the Medes, were all Aryans. It is
yet far from being proved who were the original and primitive masters of
India. That this period is now beyond the reach of documentary history,
does not preclude the probability of our theory that it was the mighty race
of builders, whether we call them Eastern Æthiopians, or dark-skinned
Aryans (the word meaning simply “noble warrior,” a “brave”). They
ruled supreme at one time over the whole of ancient India, enumerated
later by Manu as the possession of those whom our scientists term the
Sanscrit-speaking people.</p>

<p>These Hindus are <em>supposed</em> to have entered the country from the
northwest; they are <em>conjectured</em> by some to have brought with them the
Brahmanical religion, and the language of the conquerors was <em>probably</em>
the Sanscrit. On these three meagre data our philologists have worked
ever since the Hindustani and its immense Sanscrit literature was forcibly
brought into notice by Sir William Jones—all the time with the three
sons of Noah clinging around their necks. This is <em>exact</em> science, free from
religious prejudices! Verily, ethnology would have been the gainer if
this Noachian trio had been washed overboard and drowned before the

<p>The Æthiopians are generally classed in the Semitic group; but we
have to see how far they have a claim to such a classification. We will
also consider how much they might have had to do with the Egyptian
civilization, which, as a writer expresses it, seems referable in the same
perfection to the earliest dates, and not to have had a rise and progress,
as was the case with that of other peoples. For reasons that we will now
adduce, we are prepared to maintain that Egypt owes her civilization,
commonwealth and arts—especially the art of building, to pre-Vedic
India, and that it was a colony of the dark-skinned Aryans, or those whom
Homer and Herodotus term the eastern Æthiopians, <i>i.e.</i>, the inhabitants
of Southern India, who brought to it their ready-made civilization in the
ante-chronological ages, of what Bunsen calls the pre-Menite, but nevertheless
epochal history.</p>

<p>In Pococke’s <cite>India in Greece</cite>, we find the following suggestive
paragraph: “The plain account of the wars carried on between the
solar chiefs, Oosras (Osiris) the prince of the Guelas, and ‘<span class="smcap">Tu-phoo</span>’ is
the simple historical fact of the wars of the Apians, or Sun-tribes of Oude,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>

with the people of ‘<span class="smcap">Tu-phoo</span>’ or <span class="smcap">Thibet</span>, who were, in fact, the lunar
race, mostly
 <span class="lock">Buddhists<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_844" id="FNanchor_844">[844]</a></span>
 and opposed by Rama and the ‘<span class="smcap">Aityo-Pias</span>’ or
people of Oude, subsequently the <span class="smcap">Aith-io-pians</span> of
 <span class="lock">Africa.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_845" id="FNanchor_845">[845]</a></span></p>

<p>We would remind the reader in this connection, that Ravan, the giant,
who, in the <cite>Ramayana</cite>, wages such a war with Rama Chandra, is shown
as King of Lanka, which was the ancient name for Ceylon; and that
Ceylon, in those days, perhaps formed part of the main-land of Southern
India, and was peopled by the “Eastern Æthiopians.” Conquered by
Rama, the son of Dasarata, the Solar King of ancient Oude, a colony
of these emigrated to Northern Africa. If, as many suspect, Homer’s
<cite>Iliad</cite> and much of his account of the Trojan war is plagiarized from the
<cite>Ramayana</cite>, then the traditions which served as a basis for the latter
must date from a tremendous antiquity. Ample margin is thus left in
pre-chronological history for a period, during which the “Eastern Æthiopians”
might have established the hypothetical Mizraic colony, with
their high Indian civilization and arts.</p>

<p>Science is still in the dark about cuneiform inscriptions. Until these
are completely deciphered, especially those cut in rocks found in such
abundance within the boundaries of the old Iran, who can tell the secrets
they may yet reveal? There are no Sanscrit monumental inscriptions
older than Chandragupta (315 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), and the Persepolitan inscriptions
are found 220 years older. There are even now some manuscripts in
characters utterly unknown to philologists and palæographists, and one
of them is, or was, some time since in the library of Cambridge, England.
Linguistic writers class the Semitic with the Indo-European language,
generally including the Æthiopian and the ancient Egyptian in the classification.
But if some of the dialects of the modern Northern Africa, and
even the modern Gheez or Æthiopian, are now so degenerated and corrupted
as to admit of false conclusions as to the genetical relationship
between them and the other Semitic tongues, we are not at all sure that
the latter have any claim to such a classification, except in the case of
the old Coptic and the ancient Gheez.</p>

<p>That there is more consanguinity between the Æthiopians and the
Aryan, dark-skinned races, and between the latter and the Egyptians, is
something which yet may be proved. It has been lately found that the
ancient Egyptians were of the Caucasian type of mankind, and the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>

shape of their skulls is purely
 <span class="lock">Asiatic.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_846" id="FNanchor_846">[846]</a></span>
 If they were less copper-colored
than the Æthiopians of our modern day, the Æthiopians themselves might
have had a lighter complexion in days of old. The fact that, with the
Æthiopian kings, the order of succession gave the crown to the nephew
of the king, the <em>son of his sister</em>, and not to his own son, is extremely
suggestive. It is an old custom which prevails until now in Southern
India. The Rajah is not succeeded by his own sons, but by <em>his
sister’s</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>sons</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_847" id="FNanchor_847">[847]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the dialects and tongues alleged to be Semitic, the Æthiopian
alone is written from left to right like the Sanscrit and the Indo-Aryan
<span class="lock">people.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_848" id="FNanchor_848">[848]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, against the origin of the Egyptians being attributed to an
ancient Indian colony, there is no graver impediment than Noah’s disrespectful
son—Ham—himself a myth. But the earliest form of Egyptian
religious worship and government, theocratic and sacerdotal, and her
habits and customs all bespeak an Indian origin.</p>

<p>The earliest legends of the history of India mention two dynasties now
lost in the night of time; the first was the dynasty of kings, of “the race
of the sun,” who reigned in Ayodhia (now Oude); the second that of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">438</a></span>

“race of the moon,” who reigned in Pruyag (Allahabad). Let him who
desires information on the religious worship of these early kings read the
<cite>Book of the Dead</cite>, of the Egyptians, and all the peculiarities attending
this sun-worship and the sun-gods. Neither Osiris nor Horus are ever
mentioned without being connected with the sun. They are the “Sons
of the <em>Sun</em>;” “the Lord and Adorer of the Sun” is his name. “The
sun is the creator of the body, the engenderer of the gods who are <em>the
successors of the Son</em>.” Pococke, in his most ingenious work, strongly
advocates the same idea, and endeavors to establish still more firmly the
identity of the Egyptian, Greek, and Indian mythology. He shows the
head of the Rajpoot Solar race—in fact the great Cuclo-pos (Cyclop or
builder)—called “The great sun,” in the earliest Hindu tradition. This
Gok-la Prince, the patriarch of the vast bands of Inachienses, he says,
“this <em>Great Sun</em> was deified at his death, and according to the Indian
doctrine of the metempsychosis, his Soul was supposed to have transmigrated
into the bull ‘Apis,’ the Sera-pis of the Greeks, and the <span class="smcap">Soora-pas</span>,
or ‘Sun-Chief’ of the Egyptians.... <i>Osiris</i>, properly Oosras, signifies
both a ‘a bull,’ and ‘a ray of light.’ <i>Soora-pas</i> (Serapis) the sun
chief,” for the Sun in Sanscrit is Sûrya. Champollion’s <cite>Manifestation to
the Light</cite>, reminds in every chapter of the two Dynasties of the Kings of the
Sun and the Moon. Later, these kings became all deified and transformed
after death into solar and lunar deities. Their worship was the earliest
corruption of the great primitive faith which justly considered the
sun and its fiery life-giving rays as the most appropriate symbol to remind
us of the universal invisible presence of Him who is master of Life and
Death. And now it can be traced all around the globe. It was the
religion of the earliest Vedic Brahmans, who call, in the oldest hymns of
the <cite>Rig-Veda</cite>, Sûrya (the sun) and Agni (fire) “the ruler of the universe,”
“the lord of men,” and the “wise king.” It was the worship of the
Magians, the Zoroastrians, the Egyptians and Greeks, whether they
called him Mithra, or Ahura-Mazda, or Osiris, or Zeus, keeping in honor
of his next of kin, Vesta, the pure celestial fire. And this religion is
found again in the Peruvian solar-worship; in the Sabianism and heliolatry
of the Chaldees, in the Mosaic “burning bush,” the hanging of the
heads or chiefs of the people toward the Lord, the “Sun,” and even in
the Abrahamic building of fire-altars and the sacrifices of the monotheistic
Jews, to Astarté the Queen of Heaven.</p>

<p>To the present moment, with all the controversies and researches,
History and Science remain as much as ever in the dark as to the origin
of the Jews. They may as well be the exiled Tchandalas, or Pariahs, of
old India, the “bricklayers” mentioned by Vina-Svati, Veda-Vyasa and
Manu, as the Phœnicians of Herodotus, or the Hyk-sos of Josephus, or

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>

descendants of Pali shepherds, or a mixture of all these. The <cite>Bible</cite>
names the Tyrians as a kindred people, and claims dominion over
 <span class="lock">them.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_849" id="FNanchor_849">[849]</a></span></p>

<p>There is more than one important character in the <cite>Bible</cite>, whose
biography proves him a mythical hero. Samuel is indicated as the personage
of the Hebrew Commonwealth. He is the <i lang="de">doppel</i> of Samson, of
the <cite>Book of Judges</cite>, as will be seen—being the son of Anna and <span class="smcap">El-Kaina</span>,
as Samson was of Manua or Manoah. Both were fictitious
characters, as now represented in the revealed book; one was the Hebrew
Hercules, and the other Ganesa. Samuel is credited with establishing
the republic, as putting down the Canaanite worship of Baal and
Astarté, or Adonis and Venus, and setting up that of Jehovah. Then
the people demanded a king, and he anointed Saul, and after him David
of Bethlehem.</p>

<p>David is the Israelitish King Arthur. He did great achievements
and established a government in all Syria and Idumea. His dominion
extended from Armenia and Assyria on the north and northeast, the
Syrian Desert and Persian Gulf on the East, Arabia on the south, and
Egypt and the Levant on the west. Only Phœnicia was excepted.</p>

<p>His friendship with Hiram seems to indicate that he made his first expedition
from that country into Judea; and his long residence at Hebron,
the city of the Kabeiri (<i>Arba</i> or four), would seem likewise to imply that
he established a new religion in the country.</p>

<p>After David came Solomon, powerful and luxurious, who sought to
consolidate the dominion which David had won. As David was a Jehovah-worshipper,
a temple of Jehovah (Tukt Suleima) was built in Jerusalem,
while shrines of Moloch-Hercules, Khemosh, and Astarté were
erected on Mount Olivet. These shrines remained till Josiah.</p>

<p>There were conspiracies formed. Revolts took place in Idumea and
Damascus; and Ahijah the prophet led the popular movement which resulted
in deposing the house of David and making Jeroboam king.
Ever after the prophets dominated in Israel, where the calf-worship prevailed;
the priests ruled over the weak dynasty of David, and the lascivious

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">440</a></span>

local worship existed over the whole country. After the destruction
of the house of Ahab, and the failure of Jehu and his descendants
to unite the country under one head, the endeavor was made in Judah.
Isaiah had terminated the direct line in the person of Ahaz (<cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr>
9), and placed on the throne a prince from Bethlehem (<cite>Micah</cite> <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 2, 5).
This was Hezekiah. On ascending the throne, he invited the chiefs of
Israel to unite in alliance with him against Assyria (<cite>2 Chronicles</cite>, <abbr title="thirty">xxx.</abbr> 1,
21; <abbr title="thirty-one">xxxi.</abbr> 1, 5; <cite>2 Kings</cite>, <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 7). He seems to have established a
sacred college (<cite>Proverbs</cite> <abbr title="twenty-five">xxv.</abbr> 1), and to have utterly changed the worship.
Aye, even unto breaking into pieces the brazen serpent that Moses
had made.</p>

<p>This makes the story of Samuel and David and Solomon mythical.
Most of the prophets who were literate seem to have begun about this
time to write.</p>

<p>The country was finally overthrown by the Assyrians, who found the
same people and institutions as in the Phœnician and other countries.</p>

<p>Hezekiah was not the lineal, but the titular son of Ahaz. Isaiah, the
prophet, belonged to the royal family, and Hezekiah was reputed his son-in-law.
Ahaz refused to ally himself with the prophet and his party,
saying: “I will not <em>tempt</em> (depend on) the Lord” (<cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 12). The
prophet had declared: “If you will not believe, surely you shall not be
established”—foreshadowing the deposition of his direct language.
“Ye weary my God,” replied the prophet, and predicted the birth of a
child by an <i>alma</i>, or temple-woman, and that before it should attain full
age (<i>Hebrews</i> v. 14; <cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 16; <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 4), the king of Assyria should
overcome Syria and Israel. This is the prophecy which Irenæus took
such pains to connect with Mary and Jesus, and made the reason why
the mother of the Nazarene prophet is represented as belonging to the
temple, and consecrated to God from her infancy.</p>

<p>In a second song, Isaiah celebrated the new chief, to sit on the throne
of David (<abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 6, 7; <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr> 1), who should restore to their homes the Jews
whom the confederacy had led captive (<cite>Isaiah</cite>
 <abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 2-12; <cite>Joel</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 1-7;
<cite>Obadiah</cite> 7, 11, 14). Micah—his contemporary—also announced the
same event (<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 7-13; v. 1-7). The Redeemer was to come out of
Bethlehem; in other words, was of the house of David; and was to resist
Assyria to whom Ahaz had sworn allegiance, and also to reform religion
(<cite>2 Kings</cite>, <abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 4-8). This Hezekiah did. He was grandson of Zechariah
the seer (<cite>2 Chronicles</cite>, <abbr title="twenty-nine">xxix.</abbr> 1;
 <abbr title="twenty-six">xxvi.</abbr> 5), the counsellor of
Uzziah; and as soon as he ascended the throne he restored the religion
of David, and destroyed the last vestiges of that of Moses, <i>i.e.</i>, the
<em>esoteric</em> doctrine, declaring “our fathers have trespassed” (<cite>2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr></cite>,
<abbr title="twenty-nine">xxix.</abbr> 6-9). He next attempted a reunion with the northern monarchy,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>

there being an interregnum in Israel (<cite>2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr></cite>, <abbr title="thirty">xxx.</abbr> 1, 2, 6; <abbr title="thirty-one">xxxi.</abbr> 1, 6,
7). It was successful, but resulted in an invasion by the king of Assyria.
But it was a new <i lang="fr">régime</i>; and all this shows the course of two parallel
streams in the religious worship of the Israelites; one belonging to the
state religion and adopted to fit political exigencies; the other pure idolatry,
resulting from ignorance of the true esoteric doctrine preached
by Moses. For the first time since Solomon built them “the high places
were taken away.”</p>

<p>It was Hezekiah who was the expected Messiah of the exoteric state-religion.
He was the scion from the stem of Jesse, who should recall the
Jews from a deplorable captivity, about which the Hebrew historians
seem to be very silent, carefully avoiding all mention of this particular
fact, but which the irascible prophets imprudently disclose. If Hezekiah
crushed the exoteric Baal-worship, he also tore violently away the people
of Israel from the religion of their fathers, and the secret rites instituted
by Moses.</p>

<p>It was Darius Hystaspes who was the first to establish a Persian colony
in Judea, Zoro-Babel was perhaps the leader. “The name <i>Zoro-babel</i>
means ‘the seed or son of Babylon’—as Zoro-aster צרו־אשתר is the
seed, son, or prince of
 <span class="lock">Ishtar.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_850" id="FNanchor_850">[850]</a></span>
 The new colonists were doubtless <i>Judæi</i>.
This is a designation from the East. Even Siam is called Judia, and
there was an Ayodia in India. The temples of <i>Solom</i> or Peace were
numerous. Throughout Persia and Afghanistan the names of Saul and
David are very common. The “Law” is ascribed in turn to Hezekiah,
Ezra, Simon the Just, and the Asmonean period. Nothing definite;
everywhere contradictions. When the Asmonean period began, the chief
supporters of the Law were called Asideans or Khasdim (Chaldeans),
and afterward Pharisees or Pharsi (Parsis). This indicates that Persian
colonies were established in Judea and ruled the country; while all the
people that are mentioned in the books of <cite>Genesis</cite> and <cite>Joshua</cite> lived
there as a commonalty (see <cite>Ezra</cite> <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 1).</p>

<p>There is no real history in the <cite>Old Testament</cite>, and the little historical
information one can glean is only found in the indiscreet revelations of
the prophets. The book, as a whole, must have been written at various
times, or rather invented as an authorization of some subsequent worship,
the origin of which may be very easily traced partially to the Orphic
Mysteries, and partially to the ancient Egyptian rites in familiarity with
which Moses was brought up from his infancy.</p>

<p>Since the last century the Church has been gradually forced into concessions
of usurped biblical territory to those to whom it of right belonged.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>

Inch by inch has been yielded, and one personage after another been
proved mythical and Pagan. But now, after the recent discovery of George
Smith, the much-regretted Assyriologist, one of the securest props of the
<cite>Bible</cite> has been pulled down. Sargon and his tablets are about demonstrated
to be older than Moses. Like the account of <cite>Exodus</cite>, the birth
and story of the lawgiver seem to have been “borrowed” from the
Assyrians, as the “jewels of gold and jewels of silver” were said to be
from the Egyptians.</p>

<p>On page 224 of <cite>Assyrian Discoveries</cite>, Mr. George Smith says: “In
the palace of Sennacherib at Kouyunjik, I found another fragment of
the curious history of Sargon, a translation of which I published in the
<cite>Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archæology</cite>, <abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr>, part <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, page
46. This text relates that Sargon, an early Babylonian monarch, was
born of royal parents, but concealed by his mother, who placed him on
the Euphrates in an ark of rushes, coated with bitumen, like that in which
the mother of Moses hid her child (see <cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>). Sargon was discovered
by a man named Akki, a water-carrier, who adopted him as his
son; and he afterward became King of Babylonia. The capital of Sargon
was the great city of Agadi—called by the Semites Akkad—mentioned
in <cite>Genesis</cite> as a capital of Nimrod (<cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 10), and here he
reigned <em>for forty five years</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_851" id="FNanchor_851">[851]</a>
 Akkad lay near the city of
 <span class="lock"><i>Sippara</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_852" id="FNanchor_852">[852]</a></span>
 on
the Euphrates and north of Babylon. “The date of Sargon, who may be
termed the Babylonian Moses, was in the sixteenth century and perhaps
earlier.”</p>

<p>G. Smith adds in his <cite>Chaldean Account</cite> that Sargon <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> was a Babylonian
monarch who reigned in the city of Akkad about 1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The name
of Sargon signifies the right, true, or legitimate king. This curious story
is found on fragments of tablets from Kouyunjik, and reads as follows:</p>

<p>1. Sargona, the powerful king, the king of Akkad am <abbr title="One">I.</abbr></p>

<p>2. My mother was a princess, my father I did not know, a brother of
my father ruled over the country.</p>

<p>3. In the city of Azupirana, which is by the side of the river Euphrates,</p>

<p>4. My mother, the princess, conceived me; in difficulty she brought
me forth.</p>

<p>5. She placed me in an ark of rushes, with bitumen my exit she
sealed up.</p>

<p>6. She launched me in the river which did not drown me.</p>

<p>7. The river carried me to Akki, the water-carrier it brought me.</p>

<p>8. Akki, the water-carrier, in tenderness of bowels, lifted me, etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>

And now <cite>Exodus</cite> (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>): “And when she (Moses’ mother) could not
longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with
slime and with pitch, and put the child therein, and she laid it in the
flags by the river’s brink.”</p>

<p>The story, says Mr. G. Smith, “is supposed to have happened about
1600 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, rather earlier than the supposed age of
 <span class="lock">Moses<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_853" id="FNanchor_853">[853]</a></span>
 as we know that
the fame of Sargon reached Egypt, it is quite likely that this account had
a connection with the event related in <cite>Exodus</cite> <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, for every action,
when once performed, has a tendency to be repeated.”</p>

<p>The “ages” of the Hindus differ but little from those of the Greeks,
Romans, and even the Jews. We include the Mosaic computation
advisedly, and with intent to prove our position. The chronology which
separates Moses from the creation of the world by <em>only four generations</em>
seems ridiculous, merely because the Christian clergy would enforce it
upon the world
 <span class="lock">literally.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_854" id="FNanchor_854">[854]</a></span>
 The kabalists know that these generations
stand for ages of the world. The allegories which, in the Hindu calculations,
embrace the whole stupendous sweep of the four ages, are cunningly
made in the Mosaic books, through the obliging help of the
<i>Masorah</i>, to cram into the small period of two millenniums and a half
(2513)!</p>

<p>The exoteric plan of the <cite>Bible</cite> was made to answer also to four ages.
Thus, they reckon the Golden Age from Adam to Abraham; the silver,
from Abraham to David; copper, from David to the Captivity; thenceforward,
the iron. But the secret computation is quite different, and does
not vary at all from the zodiacal calculations of the Brahmans. We are
in the Iron Age, or Kali-Yug, but it began with Noah, the mythical
ancestor of our race.</p>

<p>Noah, or Nuah, like all the euhemerized manifestations of the Unrevealed
One—Swayambhuva (or Swayambhu), was androgyne. Thus, in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>

some instances, he belonged to the purely feminine triad of the Chaldeans,
known as “Nuah, the universal Mother.” We have shown, in
another chapter, that every male triad had its feminine counterpart,
one in three, like the former. It was the passive complement of the
active principle, its <em>reflection</em>. In India, the male trimurty is reproduced
in the Sakti-trimurti, the feminine; and in Chaldea, Ana, Belita and
Davkina answered to Anu, Bel, Nuah. The former three resumed in
one—Belita, were called:</p>

<p>“Sovereign goddess, lady of the nether abyss, mother of gods, queen
of the earth, queen of fecundity.”</p>

<p>As the primordial humidity, whence proceeded <em>all</em>, Belita is Tamti,
or the sea, the mother of <em>the city of Erech</em> (the great Chaldean necropolis),
therefore, an infernal goddess. In the world of stars and planets
she is known as Istar or Astoreth. Hence, she is identical with Venus,
and every other queen of heaven, to whom cakes and buns were offered
in
 <span class="lock">sacrifice,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_855" id="FNanchor_855">[855]</a></span>
 and, as all the archæologists know, with <i>Eve</i>, the mother
of all that live, and with Mary.</p>

<p>The Ark, in which are preserved the germs of all living things necessary
to repeople the earth, represents the survival of life, and the supremacy
of spirit over matter, through the conflict of the opposing powers of nature.
In the Astro-Theosophic chart of the Western Rite, the Ark corresponds
with the navel, and is placed at the sinister side, the side of the woman
(the moon), one of whose symbols is the left pillar of Solomon’s temple—Boaz.
The umbilicus is connected with the receptacle in which are
fructified the germs of the
 <span class="lock">race.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_856" id="FNanchor_856">[856]</a></span>
 The Ark is the sacred <i>Argha</i> of the
Hindus, and thus, the relation in which it stands to Noah’s ark may be
easily inferred, when we learn that the Argha was an oblong vessel, used
by the high priests as a sacrificial chalice in the worship of Isis, Astartè,
and Venus-Aphroditè, all of whom were goddesses of the generative
powers of nature, or of matter—hence, representing symbolically the Ark
containing the germs of all living things.</p>

<p>We admit that Pagans had and now have—as in India—strange symbols,
which, to the eyes of the hypocrite and Puritan, seem scandalously

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">445</a></span>

immoral. But did not the ancient Jews copy most of these symbols?
We have described elsewhere the identity of the lingham with Jacob’s
pillar, and we could give a number of instances from the present Christian
rites, bearing the same origin, did but space permit, and were not all
these noticed fully by Inman and others (See Inman’s <cite>Ancient Faiths
Embodied in Ancient Names</cite>).</p>

<p>Describing the worship of the Egyptians, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child
says: “This reverence for the production of life, introduced into the
worship of Osiris, the sexual emblems so common in Hindustan. A
colossal image of this kind was presented to his temple in Alexandria, by
King Ptolemy Philadelphus.... Reverence for the mystery of organized
life led to the recognition of a masculine and feminine principle in
all things, spiritual or material.... The sexual emblems, everywhere
conspicuous in the sculptures of their temples, would seem impure in
description, but <em>no clean and thoughtful mind</em> could so regard them
while witnessing the obvious simplicity and solemnity with which the
subject is
 <span class="lock">treated.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_857" id="FNanchor_857">[857]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus speaks this respected lady and admirable writer, and no truly
pure man or woman would ever think of blaming her for it. But such a
perversion of the ancient thought is but natural in an age of cant and
prudery like our own.</p>

<p>The water of the flood when standing in the allegory for the symbolic
“sea,” Tamti, typifies the turbulent chaos, or matter, called “the
great dragon.” According to the Gnostic and Rosicrucian mediæval doctrine,
the creation of woman was not originally intended. She is the offspring
of man’s own impure fancy, and, as the Hermetists say, “an obtrusion.”
Created by an unclean thought she sprang into existence at the
<em>evil</em> “seventh hour,” when the “supernatural” real worlds had passed
away and the “natural” or <em>delusive</em> worlds began evolving along the
“descending Microcosmos,” or the arc of the great cycle, in plainer
phraseology. First “Virgo,” the Celestial Virgin of the Zodiac, she
became “Virgo-Scorpio.” But in evolving his second companion,
man had unwittingly endowed her with his own share of Spirituality;
and the new being whom his “imagination” had called into life became
his “Saviour” from the snares of Eve-Lilith, the first Eve, who had a
greater share of matter in her composition than the primitive “spiritual”
<span class="lock">man.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_858" id="FNanchor_858">[858]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446">446</a></span>

Thus woman stands in the cosmogony in relation to “matter” or the
<em>great deep</em>, as the “Virgin of the Sea,” who crushes the “Dragon”
under her foot. The “Flood” is also very often shown, in symbolical
phraseology, as the “great Dragon.” For one acquainted with these
tenets it becomes more than suggestive to learn that with the Catholics
the Virgin Mary is not only the accepted patroness of Christian sailors,
but also the “Virgin of the Sea.” So was Dido the patroness of the
Phœnician
 <span class="lock">mariners;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_859" id="FNanchor_859">[859]</a></span>
 and together with Venus and other lunar goddesses—the
moon having such a strong influence over the tides—was the
“Virgin of the Sea.” <i>Mar</i>, the Sea, is the root of the name Mary. The
blue color, which was with the ancients symbolical of the “Great Deep”
or the material world, hence—of evil, is made sacred to our “Blessed
Lady.” It is the color of “Notre Dame de Paris.” On account of its
relation to the symbolical serpent this color is held in the deepest aversion
by the ex-Nazarenes, disciples of John the Baptist, now the Mendæans
of Basra.</p>

<p>Among the beautiful plates of Maurice, there is one representing
Christna crushing the head of the Serpent. A three-peaked mitre is on
his head (typifying the trinity), and the body and tail of the conquered
serpent encircles the figure of the Hindu god. This plate shows whence
proceeded the inspiration for the “make up” of a later story extracted
from an alleged prophecy. “I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his <em>heel</em>.”</p>

<p>The Egyptian Orante is also shown with his arms extended as on a
crucifix, and treading upon the “Serpent;” and Horus (the Logos) is
represented piercing the head of the dragon, Typhon or Aphophis. All
this gives us a clew to the biblical allegory of Cain and Abel. Cain was
held as the ancestor of the Hivites, the Serpents, and the twins of Adam
are an evident copy from the fable of Osiris and Typhon. Apart from
the external form of the allegory, however, it embodied the philosophical
conception of the eternal struggle of good and evil.</p>

<p>But how strangely elastic, how adaptable to any and every thing this
mystical philosophy proved after the Christian era! When were ever
facts, irrefutable, irrefragable, and beyond denial, less potential for the
reëstablishment of truth than in our century of casuistry and Christian
cunning? Is Christna proved to have been known as the “Good Shepherd”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span>

ages before the year <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1, to have crushed the Serpent Kalinaga,
and to have been crucified—all this was but a prophetic foreshadowing
of the future! Are the Scandinavian Thor, who bruised the head of the
Serpent with his cruciform mace, and Apollo, who killed Python, likewise
shown to present the most striking similarities with the heroes of
the Christian fables; they become but original conceptions of
“heathen” minds, “working upon the old Patriarchal prophecies
respecting the Christ, as they were contained in the one universal and
primeval
 <span class="lock">Revelation!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_860" id="FNanchor_860">[860]</a></span></p>

<p>The flood, then, is the “Old Serpent” or the great deep of matter,
Isaiah’s “dragon in the sea” (<abbr title="twenty-seven">xxvii.</abbr>1), over which the ark safely crosses
on its way to the mount of Salvation. But, if we have heard of the ark
and Noah, and the <cite>Bible</cite> at all, it is because the mythology of the
Egyptians was ready at hand for Moses (if Moses ever wrote any of the
<cite>Bible</cite>), and that he was acquainted with the story of Horus, standing on
his boat of a serpentine form, and killing the Serpent with his spear;
and with the hidden meaning of these fables, and their real origin.
This is also why we find in <cite>Leviticus</cite>, and other parts of his books,
whole pages of laws identical with those of <cite>Manu</cite>.</p>

<p>The animals shut up in the ark are the human passions. They typify
certain ordeals of initiation, and the mysteries which were instituted
among many nations in commemoration of this allegory. Noah’s ark
rested on the seventeenth of the <em>seventh</em> month. Here we have again the
number; as also in the “clean beasts” that he took by <i>sevens</i> into the
ark. Speaking of the water-mysteries of Byblos, Lucian says: “On the
top of one of the two pillars which Bacchus set up, a man remains <em>seven</em>
 <span class="lock">days.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_861" id="FNanchor_861">[861]</a></span>
 He supposes this was done to honor Deukalion. Elijah, when
praying on the top of Mount Carmel, sends his servant to look for a
cloud toward the sea, and repeats, “go again <em>seven</em> times. And it came
to pass at the <em>seventh</em> time, behold there arose a little cloud out of the sea
like a man’s
 <span class="lock">hand.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_862" id="FNanchor_862">[862]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>Noah</em> is a <i>revolutio</i> of Adam, as Moses is a revolutio of Abel and
Seth,” says the <cite>Kabala</cite>; that is to say, a repetition or another version of
the same story. The greatest proof of it is the distribution of the characters
in the <cite>Bible</cite>. For instance, beginning with Cain, the first murderer,
every <em>fifth</em> man in his line of descent is a murderer. Thus there come
Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methuselah, and the <em>fifth</em> is <i>Lamech</i>, the second

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">448</a></span>

murderer, and he is Noah’s father. By drawing the five-pointed star of
Lucifer (which has its crown-point downward) and writing the name of
Cain beneath the lowest point, and those of his descendants successively
at each of the other points, it will be found that each fifth name—which
would be written beneath that of Cain—is that of a murderer. In the
<cite>Talmud</cite> this genealogy is given complete, and thirteen murderers range
themselves in line below the name of Cain. This is <em>no</em> coincidence.
Siva is the Destroyer, but he is also the <i>Regenerator</i>. Cain is a murderer,
but he is also the creator of nations, and an inventor. This star
of Lucifer is the same one that John sees falling down to earth in his
<cite>Apocalypse</cite>.</p>

<p>In Thebes, or Theba, which means ark—TH-ABA being synonymous
with Kartha or Tyre, Astu or Athens and Urbs or Rome, and meaning also
the city—are found the same foliations as described on the pillars of the
temple of Solomon. The bi-colored leaf of the olive, the three-lobed fig-leaf,
and the lanceolate-shaped laurel-leaf, had all esoteric as well as
popular or vulgar meanings with the ancients.</p>

<p>The researches of Egyptologists present another corroboration of the
identity of the <cite>Bible</cite>-allegories with those of the lands of the Pharaohs and
Chaldeans. The dynastic chronology of the Egyptians, recorded by
Herodotus, Manetho, Eratosthenes, Diodorus Siculus, and accepted by
our antiquarians, divided the period of Egyptian history under four general
heads: the dominion of gods, demi-gods, heroes, and mortal men.
By combining the demi-gods and heroes into one class, Bunsen reduces
the periods to three: the ruling gods, the demi-gods or heroes—sons of
gods, but born of mortal mothers—and the Manes, who were the ancestors
of individual tribes. These subdivisions, as any one may perceive,
correspond perfectly with the biblical Elohim, sons of God, giants, and
mortal Noachian men.</p>

<p>Diodorus of Sicily and Berosus give us the names of the twelve great
gods who presided over the twelve months of the year and the twelve
signs of the zodiac. These names, which include
 <span class="lock">Nuah,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_863" id="FNanchor_863">[863]</a></span>
 are too well
known to require repetition. The double-faced Janus was also at the
head of twelve gods, and in his representations of him he is made to hold
the keys to the celestial domains. All these having served as models
for the biblical patriarchs, have done still further service—especially
Janus—by furnishing copy to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter and his twelve apostles, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>

former also double-faced in his denial, and also represented as holding the
keys of Paradise.</p>

<p>This statement that the story of Noah is but another version in its
hidden meaning of the story of Adam and his three sons, gathers proof on
every page of the book of <cite>Genesis</cite>. Adam is the prototype of Noah.
Adam <i>falls</i> because he eats of the forbidden fruit of <em>celestial</em> knowledge;
Noah, because he tastes of the <em>terrestrial</em> fruit: the juice of the grape
representing the abuse of knowledge in an unbalanced mind. Adam
gets stripped of his spiritual envelope; Noah of his terrestrial clothing;
and the <em>nakedness</em> of both makes them feel ashamed. The wickedness
of Cain is repeated in Ham. But the descendants of both are shown as
the wisest of races on earth; and they are called on this account
“snakes,” and the “sons of snakes,” meaning the <i>sons of wisdom</i>, and not
of Satan, as some divines would be pleased to have the world understand
the term. Enmity has been placed between the “snake” and the
“woman” only in this mortal phenomenal “world of man” as “born of
woman.” Before the carnal fall, the “snake” was <i>Ophis</i>, the divine
wisdom, which needed no matter to procreate men, humanity being utterly
spiritual. Hence the war between the snake and the woman, or between
spirit and matter. If, in its material aspect, the “old serpent” is matter,
and represents Ophiomorphos, in its spiritual meaning it becomes Ophis-Christos.
In the magic of the old Syro-Chaldeans both are conjoint in
the zodiacal sign of the androgyne of Virgo-Scorpio, and may be <em>divided</em>
or separated whenever needed. Thus as the origin of “good and evil,”
the meaning of the S.S. and Z.Z. has always been interchangeable; and
if upon some occasions the S.S. on sigils and talismans are suggestive
of serpentine evil influence and denote a design of <i>black</i> magic upon
others, the double S.S. are found on the sacramental cups of the Church
and mean the presence of the Holy Ghost, or pure wisdom.</p>

<p>The Midianites were known as the <em>wise</em> men, or sons of snakes, as
well as Canaanites and Hamites; and such was the renown of the Midianites,
that we find Moses, <em>the prophet, led on, and inspired by “the Lord,”</em>
humbling himself before Hobab, the son of Raguel, the <em>Midianite</em>, and
beseeching him to remain with the people of Israel: “Leave us not, I pray
thee; forasmuch <em>as thou knowest how we are to encamp</em> <span class="allsmcap">IN THE WILDERNESS</span>,
<em>thou mayest be to us instead of</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>eyes</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_864" id="FNanchor_864">[864]</a></span>
 Further, when Moses sends
spies to search out the land of Canaan, they bring as a proof of the wisdom
(kabalistically speaking) and goodness of the land, a branch with
<em>one</em> cluster of <em>grapes</em>, which they are compelled to bear between two men
on a staff. Moreover, they add: “we saw the children of <span class="smcap">Anak</span> there.”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450">450</a></span>

They are the <em>giants</em>, the sons of Anak, “<em>which come of the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>giants</em>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_865" id="FNanchor_865">[865]</a></span>
and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their
 <span class="lock">sight.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_866" id="FNanchor_866">[866]</a></span></p>

<p>Anak is Enoch, the patriarch, who <em>dies not</em>, and who is the first possessor
of the “mirific name,” according to the <cite>Kabala</cite>, and the ritual of
Freemasonry.</p>

<p>Comparing the biblical patriarchs with the descendants of Vaiswasvata,
the Hindu Noah, and the old Sanscrit traditions about the deluge
in the Brahmanical <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite>, we find them mirrored in the Vaidic
patriarchs who are the primitive types upon which all the others were
modelled. But before comparison is possible, the Hindu myths must be
comprehended in their true significance. Each of these mythical personages
bears, besides an astronomical significance, a spiritual or moral, and
an anthropological or physical meaning. The patriarchs are not only
euhemerized gods—the prediluvian answering to the <em>twelve</em> great gods of
Berosus, and to the <em>ten</em> Pradjâpati, and the postdiluvian to the seven
gods of the famous tablet in the Ninivian Library, but they stand also as
the symbols of the Greek Æons, the kabalistic Sephiroth, and the zodiacal
signs, as types of a series of human
 <span class="lock">races.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_867" id="FNanchor_867">[867]</a></span>
 This variation from <em>ten</em> to
<em>twelve</em> will be accounted for presently, and proved on the very authority

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>

of the <cite>Bible</cite>. Only, they are not the first gods described by
 <span class="lock">Cicero,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_868" id="FNanchor_868">[868]</a></span>
which belong to a hierarchy of higher powers, the Elohim—but appertain
rather to the second class of the “twelve gods,” the <i lang="la">Dii minores</i>, and
who are the terrestrial reflections of the first, among whom Herodotus
places
 <span class="lock">Hercules.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_869" id="FNanchor_869">[869]</a></span>
 Alone, out of the group of twelve, Noah, by reason
of his position at the transitional point, belongs to the highest Babylonian
triad, Noah, the spirit of the waters. The rest are identical with the
inferior gods of Assyria and Babylonia, who represented the lower order
of emanations, introduced around Bel, the Demiurge, and help him in
his work, as the patriarchs are shown to assist Jehovah—the “Lord
God.”</p>

<p>Besides these, many of which were <em>local</em> gods, the protecting deities
of rivers and cities, there were the four classes of genius, we see
Ezekiel making them support the throne of Jehovah in his vision. A
fact which, if it identifies the Jewish “Lord God” with one of the
Babylonian trinity, connects, at the same time, the present Christian
God with the same triad, inasmuch as it is these four cherubs, if the
reader will remember, on which Irenæus makes Jesus ride, and which
are shown as the companions of the evangelists.</p>

<p>The Hindu kabalistic derivation of the books of <cite>Ezekiel</cite> and <cite>Revelation</cite>
are shown in nothing more plainly than in this description of the four
beasts, which typify the four elementary kingdoms—earth, air, fire, and
water. As is well known, they are the Assyrian sphinxes, but these figures
are also carved on the walls of nearly every Hindu pagoda.</p>

<p>The author of the <cite>Revelation</cite> copies faithfully in his text (see <abbr title="chapter four">chap.
iv.</abbr>, verse 17) the Pythagorean pentacle, of which Levi’s admirable sketch
is reproduced on <a href="#Page_452" class="pginternal">page 452</a>.</p>

<p>The Hindu goddess Adanari (or as it might be more properly written,
Adonari, since the second a is pronounced almost like the English o) is
represented as surrounded by the same figures. It fits exactly Ezekiel’s
“wheel of the Adonai,” known as “the Cherub of Jeheskiel,” and indicates,
beyond question, the source from which the Hebrew seer drew his
allegories. For convenience of comparison we have placed the figure in
the pentacle. (See <a href="#Page_453" class="pginternal">page 453</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>

Above these beasts were the angels or spirits, divided in two groups:
the Igili, or celestial beings, and the Am-anaki, or terrestrial spirits, the
giants, children of Anak, of whom the spies complained to Moses.</p>

 <p class="caption">ADONAI</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The <cite>Kabbala Denudata</cite> gives to the kabalists a very clear, to the
profane a very muddled account of permutations or substitutions of one
person for another. So, for instance, it says, that “the scintilla”
(spiritual spark or soul) of Abraham was taken from Michael, the chief
of the Æons, and highest emanation of the Deity; so high indeed that
in the eyes of the Gnostics, Michael was identical with Christ. And yet
Michael and Enoch are one and the same person. Both occupy the
junction-point of the cross of the Zodiac as “man.” The scintilla of
Isaac was that of Gabriel, the chief of the angelic host, and the scintilla
of Jacob was taken from Uriel, named “the fire of God;” the sharpest
sighted spirit in all Heaven. Adam is not the Kadmon but Adam
<i>Primus</i>, the <i>Microprosopus</i>. In one of his aspects the latter is Enoch,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>

the terrestrial patriarch and father of Methuselah. He that “walked
with God” and “did not die” is the spiritual Enoch, who typified
humanity, eternal in spirit and as eternal in flesh, though the latter does
<em>die</em>. Death is but a new birth, and spirit is immortal; thus humanity can
never die, for the <em>Destroyer</em> has become the <em>Creator</em>, Enoch is the type
of the dual man, spiritual and terrestrial. Hence his place in the centre
of the astronomical cross.</p>

<div class="divcenter80">
 <img alt="Adonai" src="images/p453.jpg" id="img_images_p453.jpg">
 <p class="caption">ADANARI</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>But was this idea original with the Hebrews? We think not. Every nation
which had an astronomical system, and especially India, held the cross
in the highest reverence, for it was the geometrical basis of the religious
symbolism of their <em>avatars</em>; the manifestation of the Deity, or of the
Creator in his creature <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>; of God in humanity and humanity in God,
as spirits. The oldest monuments of Chaldea, Persia, and India disclose
the double or eight-pointed cross. This symbol, which very naturally is
found, like every other geometrical figure in nature, in plants as well as
in the snowflakes, has led Dr. Lundy, in his super-Christian mysticism, to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">454</a></span>

name such cruciform flowers as form an eight-pointed star by the junction
of the two crosses—“the <i>Prophetic Star of the Incarnation</i>, which
joined heaven and earth, God and man
 <span class="lock">together.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_870" id="FNanchor_870">[870]</a></span>
 The latter sentence
is perfectly expressed; only, the old kabalist axiom, “as above,
so below,” answers still better, as it discloses to us the same God for all
humanity, not alone for the handful of Christians. It is the <em>Mundane</em>
cross of Heaven repeated on earth by plants and dual man: the physical
man superseding the “spiritual,” at the junction-point of which
stands the mythical Libra-Hermes-Enoch. The gesture of one hand
pointing to Heaven, is balanced by the other pointing down to the earth;
boundless generations below, boundless regenerations above; the visible
but the manifestation of the invisible; the man of dust abandoned to
dust, the man of spirit reborn in spirit; thus it is finite humanity which
is the Son of the Infinite God. Abba—the Father; Amona—the Mother;
the Son, the Universe. This primitive triad is repeated in all the theogonies.
Adam Kadmon, Hermes, Enoch, Osiris, Christna, Ormazd, or
Christos are all one. They stand as <i>Metatrons</i> between body and soul—eternal
spirits which redeem flesh by the regeneration of flesh <em>below</em>, and
soul by the regeneration <em>above</em>, where humanity walks once more with
God.</p>

<p>We have shown elsewhere that the symbol of the cross or Egyptian
<i>Tau</i>, <b class="sansserif">T</b>, was by many ages earlier than the period assigned to Abraham,
the alleged forefather of the Israelites, for otherwise Moses could not
have learned it of the priests. And that the Tau was held as sacred by the
Jews as by other “Pagan” nations is proved by a fact admitted now
by Christian divines as well as by infidel archæologists. Moses, in <cite>Exodus</cite>
<abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 22, orders his people to mark their <em>door-posts and lintels</em> with blood,
lest the “Lord God” should make a mistake and smite some of his
chosen people, instead of the doomed
 <span class="lock">Egyptians.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_871" id="FNanchor_871">[871]</a></span>
 And this mark is a
tau! The identical Egyptian handled <em>cross</em>, with the half of which talisman
Horus raised the dead, as is shown on a sculptured ruin at Philœ.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_872" id="FNanchor_872">[872]</a>
How gratuitous is the idea that all such crosses and symbols were so
many unconscious prophecies of Christ, is fully exemplified in the case of
the Jews upon whose accusation Jesus was put to death. For instance,
the same learned author remarks in <cite>Monumental Christianity</cite> that “the
Jews themselves acknowledged this sign of salvation until they rejected

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">455</a></span>

Christ;” and in another place he asserts that the rod of Moses, used in
his miracles before Pharaoh, “was, no doubt, this <i lang="la">crux ansata</i>, or something
like it, <em>also used by the Egyptian</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>priests</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_873" id="FNanchor_873">[873]</a></span>
 Thus the logical inference
would be, that 1, if the Jews worshipped the same symbols as the
Pagans, then they were no better than they; and 2, if, being so well
versed as they were in the hidden symbolism of the cross, in the face of
their having waited for centuries for the Messiah, they yet rejected both
the Christian Messiah and Christian Cross, then there must have been
something wrong about both.</p>

<p>Those who “rejected” Jesus as the “Son of God,” were neither the
people ignorant of religious symbols, nor the handful of atheistical Sadducees
who put him to death; but the very men who were instructed in
the secret wisdom, who knew the origin as well as the meaning of the
cruciform symbol, and who put aside both the Christian emblem and the
Saviour suspended from it, because they could not be parties to such a
blasphemous imposition upon the common people.</p>

<p>Nearly all the prophecies about Christ are credited to the patriarchs
and prophets. If a few of the latter may have existed as real personages,
every one of the former is a myth. We will endeavor to prove it
by the hidden interpretation of the Zodiac, and the relations of its signs
to these antediluvian men.</p>

<p>If the reader will keep in mind the Hindu ideas of cosmogony, as
given in chapter <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr>, he will better understand the relation between the
biblical antediluvian patriarchs, and that puzzle of commentators—“Ezekiel’s
wheel.” Thus, be it remembered 1, that the universe is not a
spontaneous creation, but an evolution from pre-existent matter; 2, that
it is only one of an endless series of universes; 3, that eternity is pointed
off into grand cycles, in each of which twelve transformations of our
world occur, following its partial destruction by fire and water, alternately.
So that when a new minor period sets in, the earth is so changed, even
geologically, as to be practically a new world; 4, that of these twelve
transformations, the earth after each of the first six is grosser, and everything
on it—man included—more material, than after the preceding one:
while after each of the remaining six the contrary is true, both earth and
man growing more and more refined and spiritual with each terrestrial
change; 5, that when the apex of the cycle is reached, a gradual dissolution
takes place, and every living and objective form is destroyed.
But when that point is reached, humanity has become fitted to live
subjectively as well as objectively. And not humanity alone, but also

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">456</a></span>

animals, plants, and every atom. After a time of rest, say the Buddhists,
when a new world becomes self-formed, the astral souls of animals
and of all beings, except such as have reached the highest Nirvana,
will return on earth again to end their cycles of transformations, and
become men in their turn.</p>

<p>This stupendous conception, the ancients synthesized for the instruction
of the common people, into a single pictorial design—the Zodiac,
or celestial belt. Instead of the twelve signs now used, there were
originally but ten known to the general public, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: Aries, Taurus,
Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo-Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius,
and
 <span class="lock">Pisces.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_874" id="FNanchor_874">[874]</a></span>
 These were exoteric. But in addition there were two
mystical signs inserted, which none but initiates comprehended, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>:
at the middle or junction-point where now stands <i>Libra</i>, and at the sign
now called Scorpio, which follows Virgo. When it was found necessary to
make them exoteric, these two secret signs were added under their
present appellations as blinds to conceal the true names which gave the
key to the whole secret of creation, and divulged the origin of “good
and evil.”</p>

<p>The true Sabean astrological doctrine secretly taught that within
this double sign was hidden the explanation of the gradual transformation
of the world, from its spiritual and subjective, into the “two-sexed”
sublunary state. The twelve signs were therefore divided into two
groups. The first six were called the ascending, or the line of Macrocosm
(the great spiritual world); the last six, the descending line, or the
Microcosm (the little secondary world)—the mere reflection of the
former, so to say. This division was called Ezekiel’s wheel, and was
completed in the following way: First came the ascending five signs
(euphemerized into patriarchs), Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, and
the group concluded with Virgo-Scorpio. Then came the turning-point,
<i>Libra</i>. After which, the first half of the sign Virgo-Scorpio, was duplicated
and transferred to lead the lower, or descending group of Microcosm
which ran down to <i>Pisces</i>, or Noah (deluge). To make it clearer,
the sign Virgo-Scorpio, which appeared originally thus ♍︎, became simply
<i>Virgo</i>, and the duplication, ♏︎, or Scorpio, was placed between Libra, the
<em>seventh</em> sign (which is Enoch, or the angel Metatron, or <i>Mediator</i>
between spirit and matter, or God and man). It now became Scorpio
(or Cain), which sign or patriarch led <em>mankind to destruction</em>, according

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">457</a></span>

to exoteric theology; but, according to the true doctrine of the wisdom-religion,
it indicated <em>the degradation of the whole universe in its course of
evolution downward from the subjective to the objective</em>.</p>

<p>The sign of <i>Libra</i> is credited as a later invention by the Greeks, but
it is not generally stated that those among them who were initiated had
only made a change of names conveying the same idea as the secret
name to those “who knew,” leaving the masses as unwise as ever. Yet
it was a beautiful idea of theirs, this Libra, or the balance, expressing as
much as could possibly be done without unveiling the whole and ultimate
truth. They intended it to imply that when the course of evolution had
taken the worlds to the lowest point of grossness, where the earths and
their products were coarsest, and their inhabitants most brutish, the turning-point
had been reached—the forces were at an even balance. At the
lowest point, the still lingering divine spark of spirit within began to
convey the upward impulse. The scales typified that eternal equilibrium
which is the necessity of a universe of harmony, of exact justice, of the
balance of centripetal and centrifugal forces, darkness and light, spirit
and matter.</p>

<p><em>These additional signs of the Zodiac warrant us in saying that the Book
of Genesis as we now find it, must be of later date than the invention of
Libra by the Greeks</em>; for we find the chapters of the genealogies remodelled
to fit the new Zodiac, instead of the latter being made to correspond
with the list of patriarchs. And it is this addition and the necessity
of concealing the true key, that led the Rabbinical compilers to repeat
the names of Enoch and Lamech twice, as we see them now in the Kenite
table. Alone, among all the books of the <cite>Bible</cite>, <cite>Genesis</cite> belongs to
an immense antiquity. The others are all later additions, the earliest of
which appeared with Hilkiah, who evidently concocted it with the help
of Huldah, the prophetess.</p>

<p>As there is more than one meaning attached to the stories of the
creation and deluge, we say, therefore, that the biblical account cannot
be comprehended apart from the Babylonian story of the same; while
neither will be thoroughly clear without the Brahmanical esoteric interpretation
of the deluge, as found in the <cite>Mahâbhârata</cite> and the <cite>Satapatha-Brahmâna</cite>.
It is the Babylonians who were taught the “mysteries,” the
sacerdotal language, and their religion by the problematical Akkadians
who—according to Rawlinson came from Armenia—not the former who
emigrated to India. Here the evidence becomes clear. The Babylonian
Xisuthrus is shown by Movers to have represented the “sun” in the
Zodiac, in the sign of Aquarius, and <i>Oannes</i>, the man-fish, the semi-demon,
is Vishnu in his first avatar; thus giving the key to the double
source of the biblical revelation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span>

Oannes is the emblem of priestly, esoteric wisdom; he comes out
from the sea, because the “great deep,” the water, typifies, as we have
shown, the secret doctrine. For this same reason Egyptians deified the
Nile, apart from its being regarded, in consequence of its periodical overflows,
as the “Saviour” of the country. They even held the crocodiles
as sacred, from having their abode in the “deep.” The “Hamites,” so
called, have always preferred to settle near rivers and oceans. Water
was the first-created element, according to some old cosmogonies. This
name of Oannes is held in the greatest reverence, in the Chaldean records.
The Chaldean priests wore a head-gear like a fish’s head, and a shadbelly
coat, representing the body of a
 <span class="lock">fish.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_875" id="FNanchor_875">[875]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thales,” says Cicero, “assures that <em>water</em> is the principle of all
things; and that God is that Mind which shaped and created all things
from
 <span class="lock">water.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_876" id="FNanchor_876">[876]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“In the Beginning, <span class="smcap">Spirit</span> within strengthens Heaven and Earth,</div>

<p>Thus water represents the duality of both the Macrocosmos and the
Microcosmos, in conjunction with the vivifying <span class="allsmcap">SPIRIT</span>, and the evolution
of the little world from the universal cosmos. The deluge then, in this
sense, points to that final struggle between the conflicting elements,
which brought the first great cycle of our planet to a close. These
periods gradually merged into each other, order being brought out of
chaos, or disorder, and the successive types of organism being evolved
only as the physical conditions of nature were prepared for their appearance;
for our present race could not have breathed on earth, during that
intermediate period, not having as yet the allegorical coats of
 <span class="lock">skin.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_878" id="FNanchor_878">[878]</a></span></p>

<p>The above are the ten biblical patriarchs, identical with Hindu Pragâpatis
(Pradjâpatis), and the Sephiroth of the <cite>Kabala</cite>. We say <em>ten</em> patriarchs,
not <em>twenty</em>, for the Kenite line was devised for no other purpose
than, 1, to carry out the idea of dualism, on which is founded the philosophy
of every religion; for these two genealogical tables represent simply
the opposing powers or principles of good and evil; and 2, as a blind
for the uninitiated masses. Suppose we restore them to their primitive
form, by erasing these premeditated blinds. These are so transparent as
to require but a small amount of perspicacity to select, even though one
should use only his unaided judgment, and were not, as we are, enabled to
apply the test of the secret doctrine.</p>

<p>By ridding ourselves, therefore, of the Kenite names that are mere
duplications of the Sethite, or of each other, we get rid of Adam; of
Enoch—who, in one genealogy, is shown the father of Irad, and in the
other, the son of Jared; of Lamech, son of Methusael, whereas he,
Lamech, is son of Methuselah in the Sethite line; of Irad
 <span class="lock">(Jared),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_879" id="FNanchor_879">[879]</a></span>
Jubal and Jabal, who, with Tubal-Cain, form a trinity in one, and that
one the double of Cain; of Mehujael (who is but Mahalaleel differently
spelled), and Methusael (Methuselah). This leaves us in the Kenite genealogy
of chapter <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr>, one only, Cain, who—the first murderer and fratricide—is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>

made to stand in his line as father of Enoch, the most virtuous
of men, who does not die, but is translated alive. Turn we now to the
Sethite table, and we find that Enos, or Enoch, comes <em>second</em> from Adam,
and is father to Cain (an). This is no accident. There was an evident
reason for this inversion of paternity; a palpable design—that of creating
confusion and baffling inquiry.</p>

<p>We say, then, that the patriarchs are simply the signs of the Zodiac,
emblems, in their manifold aspects, of the spiritual and physical evolution
of human races, of ages, and of divisions of time. In astrology,
the first four of the “Houses,” in the diagrams of the “Twelve Houses
of Heaven”—namely, the first, tenth, seventh, and fourth, or the second
inner square placed with its angles upward and downward, are termed
<i>angles</i>, as being of the greatest strength and power. They answer to
Adam, Noah, Cain-an, and Enoch, Alpha, Omega, evil and good, leading
the whole. Furthermore, when divided (including the two secret
names) into four <i>trigons</i> or triads, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: fiery, airy, earthy, and watery,
we find the latter corresponding to Noah.</p>

<p>Enoch and Lamech were doubled in the table of Cain, to fill out the
required number ten in both “generations” in the <cite>Bible</cite>, instead of employing
the “Secret Name;” and, in order that the patriarchs should
correspond with the ten kabalistic Sephiroth, and fit at the same time the
ten, and, subsequently, <em>twelve</em> signs of the Zodiac, in a manner comprehensible
only to the kabalists.</p>

<p>And now, Abel having disappeared out of that line of descent, he is
replaced by Seth, who was clearly an afterthought suggested by the necessity
of not having the human race descend entirely from a murderer.
This dilemma being apparently first noticed when the Kenite table had
been completed, Adam is made (after all the generations had appeared)
to beget this son, Seth. It is a suggestive fact that, whereas the double-sexed
Adam of chapter <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> is made in the likeness of the Elohim (see
<cite>Genesis</cite> chapter <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 27 and
 <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 1 of the same), Seth (<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 3) is begotten in
Adam’s “own likeness,” thus signifying that there were men of different
races. Also, it is most noticeable that neither the age nor a single other
particular respecting the patriarchs in the Kenite table is given, whereas
the reverse is the case with those in the Sethite line.</p>

<p>Most assuredly, no one could expect to find, in a work open to the
public, the final mysteries of that which was preserved for countless ages
as the grandest secret of the sanctuary. But, without divulging the key
to the profane, or being taxed with undue indiscretion, we may be
allowed to lift a corner of the veil which shrouds the majestic doctrines
of old. Let us then write down the patriarchs as they ought to stand in
their relation to the Zodiac, and see how they correspond with the signs.</p>

The following diagram represents Ezekiel’s Wheel, as given in many
works, among others, in Hargrave Jenning’s <i>Rosicrucians</i>:</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->
<div class="pg_body_wrapper"><br></div>

<p>These signs are (follow numbers):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1, Aries; 2, Taurus; 3, Gemini; 4, Cancer; 5, Leo; 6, Virgo, or the <em>ascending</em>
line of the grand cycle of creation. After this comes 7, <i>Libra</i>—“man,” which, though
it is found right in the middle, or the intersection point, leads down the numbers:</p>

<p class="p0">8, Scorpio; 9, Sagittarius; 10, Capricornus; 11, Aquarius; and 12, Pisces.</p>
</div>

<p>While discussing the double sign of Virgo-Scorpio and Libra, Hargrave
Jennings observes (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 65):</p>

<p>“All this is incomprehensible, except in the strange mysticism of the
Gnostics and the kabalists; and the whole theory requires a key of
explanation to render it intelligible; which key is only darkly referred to
as possible, but refused absolutely, by these extraordinary men, as not
permissible to be disclosed.”</p>

<p>The said key must be turned <em>seven</em> times before the whole system is
divulged. We will give it but <em>one</em> turn, and thereby allow the profane
one glimpse into the mystery. Happy he, who understands the whole!</p>

<p>To explain the presence of Jodheva (or Yodheva), or what is generally
termed the tetragram יהוה, and of Adam and Eve, it will suffice to remind
the reader of the following verses in <cite>Genesis</cite>, with their right meaning
inserted in brackets.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. “And God [Elohim] created man in his [their] own image ... male and female
created he them [him]”—(<abbr title="chapter one">ch. i.</abbr> 27).</p>

<p>2. “Male and female created he them [him] ... and called <i>their</i> [his] name
<span class="smcap">Adam</span>”—(<abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 2).</p>
</div>

<p>When the ternary is taken in the beginning of the tetragram, it
expresses the divine creation <em>spiritually</em>, <i>i.e.</i>, without any carnal sin:
taken at its opposite end it expresses the latter; it is feminine. The
name of Eve is composed of three letters, that of the primitive or heavenly

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>

Adam, is written with one letter, Jod or Yodh; therefore it must not be
read Jehova but <i>Ieva</i>, or Eve. The Adam of the first chapter is the
spiritual, therefore pure androgyne, Adam Kadmon. When woman issues
from the left rib of the second Adam (of dust), the pure <i>Virgo</i> is separated,
and falling “into generation,” or the downward cycle, becomes
 <span class="lock"><i>Scorpio</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_880" id="FNanchor_880">[880]</a></span>
 emblem of sin and matter. While the ascending cycle points at
the purely spiritual races, or the ten prediluvian patriarchs (the Pradjâpatis,
and
 <span class="lock">Sephiroth)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_881" id="FNanchor_881">[881]</a></span>
 are led on by the creative Deity itself, who is
Adam Kadmon or Yodcheva, the lower one is that of the terrestrial
races, led on by Enoch or <i>Libra</i>, the <em>seventh</em>; who, because he is
half-divine, half-terrestrial, is said to have been taken by God alive.
Enoch, or Hermes, or Libra are one. All are the scales of universal
harmony; justice and equilibrium are placed at the central point of the
Zodiac. The grand circle of the heavens, so well discoursed upon by
Plato, in his <cite>Timæus</cite>, symbolizes the unknown as a unity; and the
smaller circles which form the cross, by their division on the plane of the
Zodiacal ring—typify, at the point of their intersection, life. The centripetal
and centrifugal forces, as symbols of Good and Evil, Spirit and
Matter, Life and Death, are also those of the Creator and the Destroyer,—Adam
and Eve, or God and the Devil, as they say in common parlance.
In the subjective, as well as in the objective worlds, they are
the two powers, which through their eternal conflict keep the universe of
spirit and matter in harmony. They force the planets to pursue their
paths, and keep them in their elliptical orbits, thus tracing the astronomical
cross in their revolution through the Zodiac. In their conflict the
centripetal force, were it to prevail, would drive the planets and living
souls into the sun, type of the invisible Spiritual Sun, the Paraâtma or
great universal Soul, their parent; while the centrifugal force would
chase both planets and <em>souls</em> into the dreary space, far from the luminary
of the objective universe, away from the spiritual realm of salvation and
eternal life, and into the chaos of final cosmic destruction, and individual
annihilation. But the <em>balance</em> is there, ever sensitive at the
intersection point. It regulates the action of the two combatants, and
the combined effort of both, causes planets and “living souls” to pursue
a double diagonal line in their revolution through Zodiac and Life; and
thus preserving strict harmony, in visible and invisible heaven and earth,
the forced unity of the two reconciles spirit and matter, and Enoch is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>

said to stand a “Metatron” before God. Reckoning from him down to
Noah and his three sons, each of these represent a new “world,” <i>i.e.</i>,
our earth, which is the
 <span class="lock">seventh<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_882" id="FNanchor_882">[882]</a></span>
 after every period of geological transformation,
gives birth to another and distinct race of men and beings.</p>

<p>Cain leads the ascending line, or Macrocosm, for he is the Son of the
“Lord,” not of Adam (<cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 1). The “Lord” is Adam Kadmon,
Cain, the Son of sinful thought, not the progeny of flesh and blood,
Seth on the other hand is the leader of the races of earth, for he is the
Son of Adam, and begotten “in his own likeness, after his image”
(<cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="five">v.</abbr> 3). Cain is
 <i>Kenu</i>, Assyrian, and means eldest, while the
Hebrew word קין <a id="hebrew15"></a> means a smith, an artificer.</p>

<p>Our science shows that the globe has passed through five distinct geological
phases, each characterized by a different stratum, and these are in
reverse order, beginning with the last: 1. The Quaternary period, in
which man appears as a certainty; 2. The Tertiary period, in which he
<em>may have</em> appeared; 3. Secondary period, that of gigantic saurians, the
megalosaurus, icthyosaurus, and plesiosaurus—<em>no vestige of man</em>; 4.
The Palæozoic period, that of gigantic crustacea; 5 (or first). The Azoic
period, during which science asserts organic life had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>And is there no possibility that there was a period, and several periods,
when man <em>existed</em>, and yet was not an organic being—therefore could
not have left any vestige of himself for exact science? <em>Spirit</em> leaves no
skeletons or fossils behind, and yet few are the men on earth who doubt
that man can live both objectively and subjectively. At all events, the
theology of the Brahmans, hoary with antiquity, and which divides the
formative periods of the earth into four ages, and places between each of
these a lapse of 1,728,000 years, far more agrees with official science and
modern discovery than the absurd chronological notions promulgated by
the Councils of Nice and Trent.</p>

<p>The names of the patriarchs were not Hebrew, though they may

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>

have been Hebraized later; they are evidently of Assyrian or Aryan
origin.</p>

<p>Thus <i>Adam</i>, for instance, stands in the explained <cite>Kabala</cite> as a convertible
term, and applies nearly to every other patriarch, as every Sephiroth
to each Sephira, and <i lang="la">vice versa</i>. Adam, Cain, and Abel form the first <em>triad</em>
of the twelve. They correspond in the Sephiral tree to the Crown, Wisdom,
and Intelligence; and in astrology to the three trigons—the fiery, the
earthy, and the airy; which fact, were we allowed to devote more space
than we have to its elucidation, would perhaps show that astrology
deserves the name of science as well as any other. Adam (Kadmon)
or Aries (ram) is identical with the Egyptian ram-headed god Amun,
fabricating man on the potter’s wheel. His duplication, therefore—or the
Adam of dust—is also Aries, Amon, when standing at the head of his
generations, for he fabricates mortals also in “his own likeness.” In
astrology the planet Jupiter is connected with the “first house” (Aries).
The color of Jupiter, as seen in the “stages of the seven spheres,” on the
tower of Borsippa, or Birs Nimrud, was
 <span class="lock"><em>red</em>;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_883" id="FNanchor_883">[883]</a></span>
 and in Hebrew Adam
means אדם “red” as well as “man.” The Hindu god Agni, who presides
at the sign of Pisces, next to that of Aries in their relation to the twelve
months (February and
 <span class="lock">March),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_884" id="FNanchor_884">[884]</a></span>
 is painted of a deep red color, with <em>two</em>
faces (male and female), <em>three</em> legs, and <em>seven</em> arms; the whole forming
the number twelve. So, also, Noah (Pisces), who appears in the generations
as the twelfth patriarch, counting Cain and Abel, is Adam again
under another name, for he is the forefather of a new race of mankind;
and with his “three sons,” one bad, one good, and one partaking of both
qualities, is the terrestrial reflection of the super-terrestrial Adam and his
three sons. Agni is represented mounted on a ram, with a tiara surmounted
by a
 <span class="lock">cross.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_885" id="FNanchor_885">[885]</a></span></p>

<p>Kain, presiding over the Taurus (Bull) of the Zodiac, is also very
suggestive. Taurus belongs to the earthy trigon, and in connection with
this sign it will not be amiss to remind the student of an allegory from
the Persian <cite>Avesta</cite>. The story goes that Ormazd produced a being—source
and type of all the universal beings—called <span class="smcap">Life</span>, or Bull in the
<cite>Zend</cite>. Ahriman (Cain) kills this being (Abel), from the seed of which

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466">466</a></span>

(Seth) new beings are produced. Abel, in Assyrian, means <i>son</i>, but in
Hebrew הבל <a id="hebrew16"></a> it means something ephemeral, not long-lived, <i>valueless</i>, and
also a “Pagan
 <span class="lock">idol,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_886" id="FNanchor_886">[886]</a></span>
 as Kain means a <i>Hermaic statue</i> (a pillar, the
symbol of generation). Likewise, Abel is the female counterpart of
Cain (male), for they are twins and probably androgynous; the latter
answering to Wisdom, the former to Intelligence.</p>

<p>So with all other patriarchs. Enos, אנוש, is <i lang="la">Homo</i> again—a man, or
the same Adam, and Enoch in the bargain; and קיון <a id="hebrew17"></a> <i>Kain-an</i> is identical
with Cain. Seth, שת, is Teth, or Thoth, or Hermes; and this is the
reason, no doubt, why Josephus, in his first book (<abbr title="chapter">ch.</abbr> 3) shows Seth so
proficient in astrology, geometry, and other occult sciences. Foreseeing
the flood, he says, he engraved the fundamental principles of his art on
two pillars of brick and stone, the latter of which “he saw himself [Josephus]
<em>to remain in Syria in his own time</em>.” Thus is it that Seth is identified
also with Enoch, to whom kabalists and Masons attribute the same
feat; and, at the same time, with Hermes, or Kadmus again, for Enoch
is identical with the former; הנוך, He-<span class="allsmcap">NOCH</span> means a teacher, an initiator,
or an initiate; in Grecian mythology, Inachus. We have seen the part
he is made to play in the Zodiac.</p>

<p>Mahalaleel, if we divide the word and write מהלה, <em>m</em>a-<em>h</em>a-<em>l</em>a, means
tender, merciful; and therefore is he made to correspond with the fourth
Sephira, <i>Love</i> or <i>Mercy</i>, emanated from the first
 <span class="lock">triad.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_887" id="FNanchor_887">[887]</a></span>
 <em>Ir</em>a<em>d</em>, ירד, or
<em>I</em>a<em>r</em>e<em>d</em>, is (minus the vowels) precisely the same. If from the verb ירד, it
means <i>descent;</i> if from ארד <a id="hebrew18"></a>, <em>ar</em>a<em>d</em>, it means offspring, and thus corresponds
perfectly with the kabalistic emanations.</p>

<p><em>L</em>a<em>m</em>e<em>ch</em>, למך,<a id="hebrew19"></a> is not Hebrew, but Greek. Lam-ach means Lam—the
father, and Ou-Lom-Ach is the father of the age; or the father of him
(Noah) who inaugurates a new era or period of creation after the <i>pralaya</i>
of the deluge; Noah being the symbol of a new world, the Kingdom
(Malchuth) of the Sephiroth; hence his father, corresponding to the ninth
Sephiroth, is the
 <span class="lock">Foundation.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_888" id="FNanchor_888">[888]</a></span>
 Furthermore, both father and son answer
to Aquarius and Pisces in the Zodiac; and thus the former belonging to
the airy and the latter to the <em>watery</em> trigons, they close the list of the
biblical myths.</p>

<p>But if, as we see, every patriarch represents, in one sense, like each
of the Pradjâpatis, a new race of antediluvian human beings; and if, as
it may as easily be proved, they are the copies of the Babylonian <cite>Saros</cite>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">467</a></span>

or ages, the latter themselves copies of the Hindu ten dynasties of the
“Lords of
 <span class="lock">beings,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_889" id="FNanchor_889">[889]</a></span>
 yet, however we may regard them, they are among
the profoundest allegories ever conceived by philosophical minds.</p>

<p>In the
 <span class="lock"><cite>Nuctemeron</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_890" id="FNanchor_890">[890]</a></span>
 the evolution of the universe and its successive
periods of formation, together with the gradual development of the
human races, are illustrated as fully as possible in the twelve “hours”
into which the allegory is divided. Each “hour” typifies the evolution
of a new man, and in its turn is divided into four quarters or ages. This
work shows how thoroughly was the ancient philosophy imbued with the
doctrines of the early Aryans, who were the first to divide the life on our
planet into four ages. If one would trace this doctrine from its source
in the night of the traditional period down to the Seer of Patmos, he
need not go astray among the religious systems of all nations. The
Babylonians he would find teaching that in four different periods four
Oannes (or suns) appeared; the Hindus asserting their four Yuga; the
Greeks, Romans, and others firmly believing in the golden, silver, brazen,
and iron ages, each of the epochs being heralded by the appearance of a
saviour. The four Buddhas of the Hindus and the three prophets of the
Zoroastrians—Oshedar-Cami, Oshedar-mah, and Sosiosh—preceded by
Zarotushtra, are the types of these ages.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Bible</cite>, the very opening tells us that <em>before the sons of God saw
the daughters of men</em>, the latter lived from 365 to 969 years. But when
the “Lord God” saw the iniquities of mankind, He concluded to allow
them at most 120 years of life (<cite>Genesis</cite> <abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 3). To account for such a
violent oscillation in the human mortality-table is only possible by tracing
this decision of the “Lord God” to its origin. Such incongruities as we
meet at every step in the <cite>Bible</cite> can be only attributed to the facts that
the book of <cite>Genesis</cite> and the other books of <i>Moses</i> were tampered with
and remodelled by more than one author; and, that in their original state
they were, with the exception of the external form of the allegories, faithful
copies from the Hindu sacred books. In <cite>Manu</cite>, book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, we find the
following:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">468</a></span></p>

<p>“In the first age, neither sickness nor suffering were known. Men
lived four centuries.”</p>

<p>This was in the Krita or Satya yug.</p>

<p>“The Krita-yug is the type of justice. The <em>bull</em> which stands firm on
its four legs is its image; man adheres to truth, and evil does not as yet
direct his
 <span class="lock">actions.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_891" id="FNanchor_891">[891]</a></span>
 But in each of the following ages primitive human
life loses one-fourth of its duration, that is to say, in Treta-yug man lives
300, in Dwapara-yug 200, and in Kali-yug, or our own age, but 100 years
generally, at the most. Noah, son of Lamech—Oulom-<i>Ach</i>, or father of
the age—is the distorted copy of Manu, son of Swayambhu, and the
six Manus or Rishis issued from the Hindu “first man” are the originals
of Terah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses, the Hebrew
sages, who beginning with Terah were all alleged to have been astrologers,
alchemists, inspired prophets, and soothsayers; or in a more profane
but plainer language—magicians.</p>

<p>If we consult the Talmudistic <cite>Mishna</cite> we find therein the first emanated
divine couple, the androgyne Demiurge Chochmah (or Hachma
Achamoth) and Binah building themselves a house with <em>seven</em> pillars.
They are the architects of God—Wisdom and Intelligence—and His
“compass and square.” The seven columns are the future <em>seven</em> worlds,
or the typical <em>seven</em> primordial “days” of creation.</p>

<p>“Chochmah immolates her victims.” These victims are the numberless
forces of nature which must “die” (expend themselves) <em>in order
that they should live</em>; when one force dies out, it is but to give birth to
another force, its progeny. It dies but lives in its children, and resuscitates
at every <em>seventh</em> generation. The servants of Chochmah, or wisdom,
are the souls of H-Adam, for in him are all the souls of Israel.</p>

<p>There are <em>twelve</em> hours in the day, says the <cite>Mishna</cite>, and it is during
these hours that is accomplished the creation of man. Would this be
comprehensible, unless we had Manu to teach us that this “day” embraces
the four ages of the world and has a duration of <em>twelve</em> thousand divine
years of the Devas?</p>

<p>“The Creators (Elohim) outline in the second” hour “the shape of
a more corporeal form of man. They separate it into two and prepare
the sexes to become distinct from each other. Such is the way the
Elohim proceeded in reference to every created
 <span class="lock">thing.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_892" id="FNanchor_892">[892]</a></span>
 “Every fish,
fowl, plant, beast and man was androgyne at the first hour.”</p>

<p>Says the commentator, the great Rabbi Simeon:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">469</a></span></p>

<p>“O, companions, companions, man as emanation was both man and
woman; as well on the side of the <span class="smcap">Father</span> as on the side of the <span class="smcap">Mother</span>.
And this is the sense of the words, and Elohim spoke, Let there be Light
and it was Light!... And this is the ‘two-fold
 <span class="lock">man!’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_893" id="FNanchor_893">[893]</a></span></p>

<p>A spiritual woman was necessary as a contrast for the spiritual man.
Harmony is the universal law. In Taylor’s translation, Plato’s discourse
upon creation is rendered so as to make him say of this universe that
“He caused it to move with circular motion.... When, therefore,
that God who is a perpetually reasoning Divinity, cogitated about that
God (man) <em>who was destined to subsist at some certain period of time</em>, He
produced his body smooth and even, and every way even and whole from
the centre, and made it perfect. This perfect circle of the created God,
<em>He decussated in the form of the letter</em> X.”</p>

<p>The italics of both these sentences from <cite>Timæus</cite> belong to Dr.
Lundy, the author of that remarkable work mentioned once before, <cite>Monumental
Christianity</cite>; and attention is drawn to the words of the Greek
philosopher, with the evident purpose of giving them the prophetic character
which Justin Martyr applied to the same, when accusing Plato of
having borrowed his “physiological discussion in the <cite>Timæus</cite> ... concerning
the Son of God placed crosswise in the universe,” from Moses
and his serpent of brass. The learned author seems to fully accord an
unpremeditated prophecy to these words; although he does not tell us
whether he believes that like Plato’s created god, Jesus was originally a
sphere “smooth and even, and every way even and whole from the centre.”
Even if Justin Martyr were excusable for his perversion of Plato,
Dr. Lundy ought to know that the day for that sort of casuistry is long
gone by. What the philosopher meant was <em>man</em>, who before being encased
in matter had no use for limbs, but was a pure spiritual entity.
Hence if the Deity, and his universe, and the stellar bodies are to be conceived
as spheroidal, this shape would be archetypal man’s. As his enveloping
shell grew heavier, there came the necessity for limbs, and the
limbs sprouted. If we fancy a man with arms and legs naturally extended
at the same angle, by backing him against the circle that symbolizes his
prior shape as a spirit, we would have the very figure described by Plato—the
X cross within the circle.</p>

<p>All the legends of the creation, the fall of man, and the resultant
deluge, belong to universal history, and are no more the property of the
Israelites than that of any other nation. What specially belongs to
them (kabalists excepted) are the disfigured details of every tradition.
The <cite>Genesis</cite> of Enoch is by far anterior to the books of
 <span class="lock">Moses,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_894" id="FNanchor_894">[894]</a></span>
 and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">470</a></span>

Guillaume Postel has presented it to the world, explaining the allegories
as far as he dared; but the ground-work is still unexposed. For the
Jews, the <cite>Book of Enoch</cite> is as canonical as the Mosaic books; and if the
Christians accepted the latter as an authority, we do not see why they
should reject the former as an apocrypha. No more can the age of one
than that of the other be determined with anything like certainty. At
the time of the separation, the Samaritans recognized only the books of
Moses and that of Joshua, says Dr.
 <span class="lock">Jost.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_895" id="FNanchor_895">[895]</a></span>
 In 168 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Jerusalem had
its temple plundered, and all the sacred books were
 <span class="lock">destroyed;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_896" id="FNanchor_896">[896]</a></span>
 therefore,
the few <abbr title="Manuscripts">MSS.</abbr> that remained were to be found only among the
“teachers of tradition.” The kabalistic Tanaïm, and their initiates and
prophets had always practised its teachings in common with the Canaanites,
the Hamites, Midianites, Chaldeans, and all other nations. The
story of Daniel is a proof of it.</p>

<p>There was a sort of Brotherhood, or Freemasonry among the kabalists
scattered all over the world, since the memory of man; and, like
some societies of the mediæval Masonry of Europe, they called themselves
 <span class="lock"><i>Companions</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_897" id="FNanchor_897">[897]</a></span>
 and <i>Innocents</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_898" id="FNanchor_898">[898]</a>
    It is a belief (founded on knowledge)
among the kabalists, that no more than the Hermetic rolls are
the genuine sacred books of the seventy-two elders—books which contained
the “<cite>Ancient Word</cite>”—lost, but that they have all been preserved
from the remotest times among secret communities. Emanuel Swedenborg
says as much, and his words are based, he says, on the information
he had from certain <em>spirits</em>, who assured him that “they performed their
worship according to this Ancient Word.” “Seek for it in China,” adds
the great seer, “peradventure you may find it in Great Tartary!” Other
students of occult sciences have had more than the word of “certain
spirits” to rely upon in this special case—they have seen the books.</p>

<p>We must choose therefore perforce between two methods—either to
accept the <cite>Bible</cite> exoterically or esoterically. Against the former we have
the following facts: That, after the first copy of the <cite>Book of God</cite> has been
edited and launched on the world by Hilkiah, this copy disappears, and
Ezra has to make a <em>new Bible</em>, which Judas Maccabeus finishes; that
when it was copied from the horned letters into square letters, it was
corrupted beyond recognition; that the <i>Masorah</i> completed the work of
destruction; that, finally, we have a text, not 900 years old, abounding

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">471</a></span>

with omissions, interpolations, and premeditated perversions; and that,
consequently, as this Masoretic Hebrew text has fossilized its mistakes,
and the key to the “Word of God” is lost, no one has a right to enforce
upon so-called “Christians” the divagations of a series of hallucinated
and, perhaps, spurious prophets, under the unwarranted and untenable
assumption that the author of it was the “Holy Ghost” in <i lang="la">propria personæ</i>.</p>

<p>Hence, we reject this pretended monotheistic Scripture, made up
just when the priests of Jerusalem found their political profit in violently
breaking off all connection with the Gentiles. It is at this moment only
that we find them persecuting kabalists, and banning the “old wisdom” of
both Pagans and Jews. <em>The real Hebrew Bible was a secret volume,
unknown to the masses</em>, and even the Samaritan <cite>Pentateuch</cite> is far more
ancient than the <cite>Septuagint</cite>. As for the former, the Fathers of the
Church never even heard of it. We prefer decidedly to take the word
of Swedenborg that the “Ancient Word” is <em>somewhere in China or the
Great Tartary</em>. The more so, as the Swedish seer is declared, at least
by one clergymen, namely, the Reverend Dr. R. L. Tafel, of London, to
have been in a state of “inspiration from God,” while writing his theological
works. He is given even the superiority over the penmen of the
<cite>Bible</cite>, for, while the latter had the words spoken to them in their ears,
Swedenborg was made to understand them rationally and was, therefore,
<em>internally</em> and not externally illuminated. “When,” says the reverend
author, “a conscientious member of the New Church hears any charges
made against the divinity and the infallibility of either the soul or the body
of the doctrines of the New Jerusalem, he must at once place himself on
the unequivocal declaration made in those doctrines, that the Lord has
effected His second coming in and by means of those writings which were
published by Emanuel Swedenborg, as His servant, and that, therefore,
those charges are not and cannot be true.” And if it is “the Lord”
that spoke through Swedenborg, then there is a hope for us that at least
one divine will corroborate our assertions, that the ancient “word of
God” is nowhere but in the heathen countries, especially <em>Buddhistic
Tartary, Thibet, and China</em>!</p>

<p>“The primitive history of Greece is the primitive history of India,”
exclaims Pococke in his <cite>India in Greece</cite>. In view of subsequent fruits
of critical research, we may paraphrase the sentence and say: “The primitive
history of Judea is a distortion of Indian fable engrafted on that
of Egypt. Many scientists, encountering stubborn facts, and being reluctant
to contrast the narratives of the “divine” revelation with those of
the Brahmanical books, merely present them to the reading public.
Meanwhile they limit their conclusions to criticisms and contradictions

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">472</a></span>

of each other. So Max Müller opposes the theories of Spiegel, and
some one else; and Professor Whitney those of the Oxford Orientalist;
and Dr. Haug made onslaughts on Spiegel, while Dr. Spiegel chose some
other victim; and now even the time-honored Akkadians and Turanians
have had their day of glory. The <i>Proto-Kasdeans</i>, <i>Kasdeo-Scyths</i>, <i>Sumirians</i>,
and what not, have to make room for some other fictions. Alas!
for the Akkads, Halevy, the Assyriologist attacks the Akkado-Sumirian
language of old Babylon, and Chabas, the Egyptologist, not content with
dethroning the Turanian speech, which has rendered such eminent services
to Orientalists when perplexed, calls the venerable parent of the Akkadians—François
Lenormant—himself, a charlatan. Profiting by the
learned turmoil, the Christian clergy take heart for their fantastic theology
on the ground that when the jury disagree there is a gain of time at least
for the indicted party. And thus is overlooked the vital question
whether Christendom would not be the better for adopting Christism in
place of Christianity, with its <cite>Bible</cite>, its vicarious atonement and its Devil.
But to so important a personage as the latter, we could not do less than
devote a special chapter.</p>

<p>Does this offend? Does it seem extravagant, cruel, blasphemous?
Listen. In the city of New York, on the ninth day of April, 1877—that
is to say, in the last quarter of what is proudly styled the century of discovery
and the age of illumination—the following scandalous ideas were
broached. We quote from the report in the <i>Sun</i> of the following morning:</p>

<p>“The Baptist preachers met yesterday in the Mariners’ Chapel, in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474">474</a></span>
Oliver Street. Several foreign missionaries were present. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
John W. Sarles, of Brooklyn, read an essay, in which he maintained the
proposition <em>that all adult heathen, dying without the knowledge of the
Gospel, are damned eternally</em>. Otherwise, the reverend essayist argued,
the Gospel is a curse instead of a blessing, the men who crucified Christ
served him right, and the whole structure of revealed religion tumbles to
the ground.</p>

<p>“Brother Stoddard, a missionary from India, indorsed the views of the
Brooklyn pastor. The Hindus were great sinners. One day, after he
had preached in the market place, a Brahman got up and said: ‘We
Hindus beat the world in lying, but this man beats us. How can he say
that God loves us? Look at the poisonous serpents, tigers, lions, and all
kinds of dangerous animals around us. If God loves us, why doesn’t He
take them away?’</p>

<p>“The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. Pixley, of Hamilton, N. Y., heartily subscribed to the
doctrine of Brother Sarles’s essay, and asked for $5,000 to fit out young
men for the ministry.”</p>

<p>And these men—we will not say teach the doctrine of Jesus, for that
would be to insult his memory, but—are <em>paid</em> to teach his doctrine! Can
we wonder that intelligent persons prefer annihilation to a faith encumbered
by such a monstrous doctrine? We doubt whether any respectable
Brahman would have confessed to the vice of lying—an art cultivated only
in those portions of British India where the most Christians are
 <span class="lock">found<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_899" id="FNanchor_899">[899]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">475</a></span>

But we challenge any honest man in the wide world to say whether he
thinks the Brahman was far from the truth in saying of the missionary
Stoddard, “this man beats us all” in lying. What else would he say, if
the latter preached to them the doctrine of <em>eternal damnation</em>, because,
indeed, they had passed their lives without reading a Jewish book of
which they never heard, or asked salvation of a Christ whose existence
they never suspected! But Baptist clergymen who need a few thousand
dollars must devise terrifying sensations to fire the congregational heart.</p>

<p>We abstain, as a rule, from giving our own experience when we can
call acceptable witnesses, and so, upon reading missionary Stoddard’s
outrageous remarks, we requested our acquaintance, Mr. William L. D.
 <span class="lock">O’Grady,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_901" id="FNanchor_901">[901]</a></span>
 to give a fair opinion upon the missionaries. This gentleman’s
father and grandfather were British army officers, and he himself was
born in India, and enjoyed life-long opportunities to learn what the general
opinion among the English is of these religious propagandists. Following
is his communication in reply to our letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You ask me for my opinion of the Christian missionaries in India. In all the
years I spent there, I never spoke to a single missionary. They were not in society,
and, from what I heard of their proceedings and could see for myself, I don’t wonder
at it. <em>Their influence on the natives is bad.</em> Their converts are worthless, and, as a
rule, of the lowest class; <em>nor do they improve by conversion</em>. No respectable family
will employ Christian servants. They lie, they steal, they are unclean—and dirt is
certainly not a Hindu vice; they drink—and no decent native of any other belief ever
touches intoxicating liquor; they are outcasts from their own people and utterly despicable.
Their new teachers set them a poor example of consistency. While holding
forth to the Pariah that God makes no distinction of persons, they boast intolerably
over the stray Brahmans, who, very much “off color,” occasionally, at long intervals,
fall into the clutches of these hypocrites.</p>

<p>“The missionaries get very small salaries, as publicly stated in the proceedings of
the societies that employ them, but, in some unaccountable way, manage to live as well
as officials with ten times their income. When they come home to recover their health,
shattered, as they say, by their arduous labors—which they seem to be able to afford to
do quite frequently, when supposed richer people cannot—they tell childish stories on
platforms, exhibit idols as procured with infinite difficulty, which is quite absurd, and
give an account of their imaginary hardships which is perfectly harrowing but untrue
from beginning to end. I lived some years in India myself, and nearly all my blood-relations
have passed or will pass the best years of their lives there. I know hundreds
of British officials, and I never heard from one of them a single word in favor of the
missionaries. Natives of any position look on them with the supremest contempt,
although suffering chronic exasperation from their arrogant aggressiveness; and the
British Government, which continues endowments to Pagodas, granted by the East

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">476</a></span>

India Company, and which supports unsectarian education, gives them no countenance
whatever. Protected from personal violence, they yelp and bark at natives and Europeans
alike, after the fashion of ill-conditioned curs. Often recruited from the poorest
specimens of theological fanaticism, they are regarded on all sides as mischievous. Their
rabid, reckless, vulgar, and offensive propagandism caused the great Mutiny of 1857.
They are noisome humbugs.</p>

</div>

<p>The new creed therefore, with which we opened this chapter, coarse as
it may sound, embodies the very essence of the belief of the Church
as inculcated by her missionaries. It is regarded as less impious, less
infidel, to doubt the personal existence of the Holy Ghost, or the equal
Godhead of Jesus, than to question the personality of the Devil. But
a summary of Koheleth is well-nigh

 The “bull’s eye” in the
target of Modern Christianity is in the simple phrase to “fear the Devil.”</p>

<p>The Catholic clergy and some of the lay champions of the Roman
Church fight still more for the existence of Satan and his imps. If Des
Mousseaux maintains the objective reality of spiritual phenomena with
such an unrelenting ardor, it is because, in his opinion, the latter are the
most direct evidence of the Devil at work. The Chevalier is more
Catholic than the Pope; and his logic and deductions from never-to-be
and non-established premises are unique, and prove once more that the
creed offered by us is the one which expresses the Catholic belief most
eloquently.</p>

<p>“If magic and spiritualism,” he says, “were both but chimeras, we
would have to bid an eternal farewell to all the rebellious angels, now
troubling the world; for thus, we would have <em>no more demons down here</em>....
And <em>if we lost our demons, we would</em> <span class="smcap">lose our Saviour</span> likewise.
For, from whom did that Saviour come to save us? And then, there
would be no more Redeemer; for from whom or what could that Redeemer
redeem us? Hence, <em>there would be no more</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Christianity</em>!!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_905" id="FNanchor_905">[905]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, Holy Father of Evil; Sainted Satan! We pray thee do not abandon
such pious Christians as the Chevalier des Mousseaux and some
Baptist clergymen!!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">477</a></span>

For our part, we would rather remember the wise words of J. C.
 <span class="lock">Colquhoun,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_906" id="FNanchor_906">[906]</a></span>
who says that “those persons who, in modern times, adopt the
doctrine of the Devil in its strictly literal and personal application, do not
appear to be aware that they are in reality polytheists, heathens, idolaters.”</p>

<p>Seeking supremacy in everything over the ancient creeds, the Christians
claim the discovery of the Devil officially recognized by the Church.
Jesus was the first to use the word “legion” when speaking of them;
and it is on this ground that M. des Mousseaux thus defends his position
in one of his demonological works. “Later,” he says, “when the synagogue
<em>expired</em>, depositing its inheritance in the hands of Christ, were
born into the world and <em>shone</em>, the Fathers of the Church, who have been
accused by certain persons of a rare and precious ignorance, of having
borrowed their ideas as to the spirits of darkness from the theurgists.”</p>

<p>Three deliberate, palpable, and easily-refuted errors—not to use a
harsher word—occur in these few lines. In the first place, the synagogue,
far from having <em>expired</em>, is flourishing at the present day in nearly every
town of Europe, America, and Asia; and of all churches in Christian
cities, it is the most firmly established, as well as the best behaved.
Further—while no one will deny that many Christian Fathers were born
into the world (always, of course, excepting the twelve fictitious Bishops
of Rome, who were never born at all), every person who will take the
trouble to read the works of the Platonists of the old Academy, who
were theurgists before Iamblichus, will recognize therein the origin of
Christian Demonology as well as the Angelology, the allegorical meaning
of which was completely distorted by the Fathers. Then it could hardly
be admitted that the said Fathers ever <em>shone</em>, except, perhaps, in the
refulgence of their extreme ignorance. The Reverend Dr. Shuckford,
who passed the better part of his life trying to reconcile their contradictions
and absurdities, was finally driven to abandon the whole thing in
despair. The ignorance of the champions of Plato must indeed appear
rare and precious by comparison with the fathomless profundity of Augustine,
“the giant of learning and erudition,” who scouted the sphericity
of the earth, for, if true, it would prevent the antipodes from seeing
the Lord Christ when he descended from heaven at the second advent;
or, of Lactantius, who rejects with pious horror Pliny’s identical
theory, on the remarkable ground that it would make the trees at the
other side of the earth grow and the men walk with their heads downward;
or, again, of Cosmas-Indicopleustes, whose orthodox system of
geography is embalmed in his “Christian topography;” or, finally, of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">478</a></span>

Bede, who assured the world that the heaven “is tempered with glacial
waters, lest it should be set on
 <span class="lock">fire”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_907" id="FNanchor_907">[907]</a>—a</span>
 benign dispensation of Providence,
most likely to prevent the radiance of their learning from setting
the sky ablaze!</p>

<p>Be this as it may, these resplendent Fathers certainly did borrow
their notions of the “spirits of darkness” from the Jewish kabalists and
Pagan theurgists, with the difference, however, that they disfigured and
outdid in absurdity all that the wildest fancy of the Hindu, Greek, and
Roman rabble had ever created. There is not a dev in the Persian Pandaimonion
half so preposterous, as a conception, as des Mousseaux’s <cite>Incubus</cite>
revamped from Augustine. Typhon, symbolized as an <em>ass</em>, appears a
philosopher in comparison with the devil caught by the Normandy peasant
in a key-hole; and it is certainly not Ahriman or the Hindu Vritra
who would run away in rage and dismay, when addressed as <em><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Satan</em>,
by a native Luther.</p>

<p>The Devil is the patron genius of theological Christianity. So “holy
and reverend is his name” in modern conception, that it may not, except
occasionally from the pulpit, be uttered in ears polite. In like
manner, anciently, it was not lawful to speak the sacred names or repeat
the jargon of the Mysteries, except in the sacred cloister. We
hardly know the names of the Samothracian gods, but cannot tell precisely
the number of the Kabeiri. The Egyptians considered it blasphemous
to utter the title of the gods of their secret rites. Even now, the
Brahman only pronounces the syllable <i>Om</i> in silent thought, and the
Rabbi, the Ineffable Name, יהוה. Hence, we who exercise no such
veneration, have been led into the blunders of miscalling the names of
<span class="smcap">Hisiris</span> and <span class="smcap">Yava</span> by the mispronunciations, Osiris and Jehovah. A
similar glamour bids fair, it will be perceived, to gather round the designation
of the dark personage of whom we are treating; and in the familiar
handling, we shall be very likely to shock the peculiar sensibilities
of many who will consider a free mentioning of the Devil’s names as
blasphemy—the sin of sins, that “hath never
 <span class="lock">forgiveness.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_908" id="FNanchor_908">[908]</a></span></p>

<p>Several years ago an acquaintance of the author wrote a newspaper
article to demonstrate that the <i>diabolos</i> or Satan of the <cite>New Testament</cite>
denoted the personification of an abstract idea, and not a personal being.
He was answered by a clergyman, who concluded the reply with the
deprecatory expression, “I fear that he has denied his Saviour.” In his
rejoinder he pleaded, “Oh, no! we only denied the Devil.” But the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">479</a></span>

clergyman failed to perceive the difference. In his conception of the
matter, the denying of the personal objective existence of the Devil was
itself “the sin against the Holy Ghost.”</p>

<p>This necessary Evil, dignified by the epithet of “Father of Lies,” was,
according to the clergy, the founder of all the world-religions of ancient
time, and of the heresies, or rather heterodoxies, of later periods, as well
as the <i lang="la">Deus ex Machina</i> of modern Spiritualism. In the exceptions which
we take to this notion, we protest that we do not attack true religion or
sincere piety. We are only carrying on a controversy with human dogmas.
Perhaps in doing this we resemble Don Quixote, because these
things are only windmills. Nevertheless, let it be remembered that they
have been the occasion and pretext for the slaughtering of more than fifty
millions of human beings since the words were proclaimed: “<span class="smcap">Love your</span>
<span class="lock"><span class="smcap">enemies</span>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_909" id="FNanchor_909">[909]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a late day for us to expect the Christian clergy to undo and
amend their work. They have too much at stake. If the Christian
Church should abandon or even modify the dogma of an anthropomorphic
devil, it would be like pulling the bottom card from under a castle of
cards. The structure would fall. The clergymen to whom we have
alluded perceived that upon the relinquishing of Satan as a personal devil,
the dogma of Jesus Christ as the second deity in their trinity must go over
in the same catastrophe. Incredible, or even horrifying, as it may seem,
the Roman Church bases its doctrine of the godhood of Christ entirely
upon the satanism of the fallen archangel. We have the testimony of
Father Ventura, who proclaims the vital importance of this dogma to the
Catholics.</p>

<p>The Reverend Father Ventura, the illustrious ex-general of the Theatins,
certifies that the Chevalier des Mousseaux, by his treatise, <cite lang="fr">Mœurs et
Pratiques des Démons</cite>, has deserved well of mankind, and still more of
the most Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. With this voucher, the
noble Chevalier, it will be perceived, “speaks as one having authority.”
He asserts explicitly, that <em>to the Devil and his angels we are absolutely
indebted for our Saviour</em>; and that but for them <em>we would have no
Redeemer, no Christianity</em>.</p>

<p>Many zealous and earnest souls have revolted at the monstrous dogma
of John Calvin, the popekin of Geneva, that <em>sin is the necessary cause of
the greatest good</em>. It was bolstered up, nevertheless, by logic like that
of des Mousseaux, and illustrated by the same dogmas. The execution
of Jesus, the god-man, on the cross, was the most prodigious crime in the
universe, yet it was necessary that mankind—those predestinated to everlasting

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">480</a></span>

life—might be saved. D’Aubigné cites the quotation by Martin
Luther from the canon, and makes him exclaim, in ecstatic rapture: “<cite lang="la">O
beata culpa, qui talem meruisti redemptorem</cite>!” O blessed sin, which
didst merit such a Redeemer. We now perceive that the dogma which
had appeared so monstrous is, after all, the doctrine of Pope, Calvin, and
Luther alike—that the three are one.</p>

<p>Mahomet and his disciples, who held Jesus in great respect as a
prophet, remarks Eliphas Levi, used to utter, when speaking of Christians,
the following remarkable words: “Jesus of Nazareth was verily a true
prophet of Allah and a grand man; but lo! his disciples all went insane
one day, and made a god of him.”</p>

<p>Max Müller kindly adds: “It was a mistake of the early Fathers to
treat the heathen gods as demons or evil spirits, and we must take care
not to commit the same error with regard to the Hindu
 <span class="lock">gods.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_910" id="FNanchor_910">[910]</a></span></p>

<p>But we have Satan presented to us as the prop and mainstay of
sacerdotism—an Atlas, holding the Christian heaven and cosmos upon
his shoulders. If he falls, then, in their conception, all is lost, and chaos
must come again.</p>

<p>This dogma of the Devil and redemption seems to be based upon two
passages in the <cite>New Testament</cite>: “For this purpose the Son of God was
manifested, that he might destroy the works of the
 <span class="lock">Devil.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_911" id="FNanchor_911">[911]</a></span>
 “And there
was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon;
and the Dragon fought, and his angels, and prevailed not; neither was
their place found any more in heaven. And the great Dragon was cast
out, that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the
whole world.” Let us, then, explore the ancient Theogonies, in order
to ascertain what was meant by these remarkable expressions.</p>

<p>The first inquiry is whether the term <i>Devil</i>, as here used, actually
represents the malignant Deity of the Christians, or an antagonistic, blind
force—the dark side of nature. By the latter we are not to understand
the manifestation of any evil principle that is <i lang="la">malum in se</i>, but only the
shadow of the Light, so to say. The theories of the kabalists treat of it
as a force which is antagonistic, but at the same time essential to the
vitality, evolving, and vigor of the good principle. Plants would perish in
their first stage of existence, if they were kept exposed to a constant sunlight;
the night alternating with the day is essential to their healthy
growth and development. Goodness, likewise, would speedily cease to
be such, were it not alternated by its opposite. In human nature, evil
denotes the antagonism of matter to the spiritual, and each is accordingly
purified thereby. In the cosmos, the equilibrium must be preserved; the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">481</a></span>

operation of the two contraries produce harmony, like the centripetal and
centrifugal forces, and are necessary to each other. If one is arrested,
the action of the other will immediately become destructive.</p>

<p>This personification, denominated <i>Satan</i>, is to be contemplated from
three different planes: the <cite>Old Testament</cite>, the Christian Fathers, and
the ancient Gentile altitude. He is supposed to have been represented
by the Serpent in the Garden of Eden; nevertheless, the epithet of Satan
is nowhere in the Hebrew sacred writings applied to that or any other
variety of ophidian. The Brazen Serpent of Moses was worshipped by
the Israelites as a
 <span class="lock">god;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_912" id="FNanchor_912">[912]</a></span>
 being the symbol of Esmun-Asklepius the
Phœnician Iao. Indeed, the character of Satan himself is introduced in
the 1st book of <cite>Chronicles</cite> in the act of instigating King David to number
the Israelitish people, an act elsewhere declared specifically to have
been moved by Jehovah
 <span class="lock">himself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_913" id="FNanchor_913">[913]</a></span>
 The inference is unavoidable that
the two, Satan and Jehovah, were regarded as identical.</p>

<p>Another mention of Satan is found in the <cite>prophecies of Zechariah</cite>.
This book was written at a period subsequent to the Jewish colonization
of Palestine, and hence, the Asideans may fairly be supposed to have
brought the personification thither from the East. It is well known that
this body of sectaries were deeply imbued with the Mazdean notions;
and that they represented Ahriman or Anra-manyas by the god-names
of Syria. Set or Sat-an, the god of the Hittites and Hyk-sos, and Beel-Zebub
the oracle-god, afterward the Grecian Apollo. The prophet
began his labors in Judea in the second year of Darius Hystaspes, the
restorer of the Mazdean worship. He thus describes the encounter with
Satan: “He showed me Joshua the high-priest standing before the angel
of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary.
And the Lord said unto Satan: ‘The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan; even
the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand
plucked out of the
 <span class="lock">fire?’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_914" id="FNanchor_914">[914]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">482</a></span>

We apprehend that this passage which we have quoted is symbolical.
There are two allusions in the <cite>New Testament</cite> that indicate that it was
so regarded. The <cite>Catholic Epistle of Jude</cite> refers to it in this peculiar
language: “Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the Devil,
he disputed about the body of Moses, did not venture to utter to him a
reviling judgment κρῑσιν ἐπενεγκεῖν βλασφημίας, but said, ‘The Lord rebuke
 <span class="lock">thee.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_915" id="FNanchor_915">[915]</a></span>
 The archangel Michael is thus mentioned as identical
with the יהוה Lord, or angel of the Lord, of the preceding quotation, and
thus is shown that the Hebrew Jehovah had a twofold character, the
secret and that manifested as the angel of the Lord, or Michael the archangel.
A comparison between these two passages renders it plain that
“the body of Moses” over which they contended was Palestine, which
as “the land of the
 <span class="lock">Hittites”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_916" id="FNanchor_916">[916]</a></span>
 was the peculiar domain of Seth, their
tutelar
 <span class="lock">god.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_917" id="FNanchor_917">[917]</a></span>
 Michael, as the champion of the Jehovah-worship, contended
with the Devil or Adversary, but left judgment to his superior.</p>

<p>Belial is not entitled to the distinction of either god or devil. The
term בליעל, <span class="smcap">Belial</span>, is defined in the Hebrew lexicons to mean a destroying,
waste, uselessness; or the phrase איש־בליעל <span class="smcap">ais-Belial</span> or Belial-man
signifies a wasteful, useless man. If Belial must be personified to
please our religious friends, we would be obliged to make him perfectly
distinct from Satan, and to consider him as a sort of spiritual “Diakka.”
The demonographers, however, who enumerate nine distinct orders of <i>daimonia</i>,
make him chief of the third class—a set of hobgoblins, mischievous
and good-for-nothing.</p>

<p>Asmodeus is no Jewish spirit at all, his origin being purely Persian.
Bréal, the author of <cite lang="fr">Hercule et Cacus</cite>, shows that he is the Parsi Eshem-Dev,
or Aéshma-dev, the evil spirit of concupiscence, whom Max Müller
tells us “is mentioned several times in the <cite>Avesta</cite> as one of the
 <span class="lock">Devs,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_918" id="FNanchor_918">[918]</a></span>
originally gods, who became evil spirits.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">483</a></span>

Samael is Satan; but Bryan and a good many other authorities show
it to be the name of the “Simoun”—the wind of the
 <span class="lock">desert,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_919" id="FNanchor_919">[919]</a></span>
 and the
Simoun is called Atabul-os or Diabolos.</p>

<p>Plutarch remarks that by Typhon was understood anything violent,
unruly, and disorderly. The overflowing of the Nile was called by the
Egyptians Typhon. Lower Egypt is very flat, and any mounds built
along the river to prevent the frequent inundations, were called Typhonian
or <i>Taphos</i>; hence, the origin of Typhon. Plutarch, who was a
rigid, orthodox Greek, and never known to much compliment the Egyptians,
testifies in his <i>Isis and Osiris</i>, to the fact that, far from worshipping
the Devil (of which Christians accused them), they despised more than
they dreaded Typhon. In his symbol of the opposing, obstinate power
of nature, they believed him to be a poor, struggling, half-dead divinity.
Thus, even at that remote age, we see the ancients already <em>too enlightened
to believe in a personal devil</em>. As Typhon was represented in one
of his symbols under the figure of an ass at the festival of the sun’s sacrifices,
the Egyptian priests exhorted the faithful worshippers not to
carry gold ornaments upon their bodies for fear of giving food to the
<span class="lock"><em>ass</em>!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_920" id="FNanchor_920">[920]</a></span></p>

<p>Three and a half centuries before Christ, Plato expressed his opinion
of evil by saying that “there is in matter a blind, refractory force, which
resists the will of the Great Artificer.” This blind force, under Christian
influx, was made to see and become responsible; it was transformed into
Satan!</p>

<p>His identity with Typhon can scarcely be doubted upon reading the
account in <cite>Job</cite> of his appearance with the sons of God, before the Lord.
He accuses Job of a readiness to curse the Lord to his face upon sufficient
provocation. So Typhon, in the Egyptian <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>,
figures as the accuser. The resemblance extends even to the names,
for one of Typhon’s appellations was <i>Seth</i>, or <i>Seph</i>; as Sâtân, in Hebrew,
means an adversary. In Arabic the word is <i>Shâtana</i>—to be adverse,
to persecute, and Manetho says he had treacherously murdered
Osiris and allied himself with the Shemites (the Israelites). This may
possibly have originated the fable told by Plutarch, that, from the fight
between Horus and Typhon, Typhon, overcome with fright at the mischief

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">484</a></span>

he had caused, “fled seven days on an ass, and escaping, begat the
boys Ierosolumos and Ioudaios (Jerusalem and Judea).”</p>

<p>Referring to an invocation of Typhon-Seth, Professor Reuvens says that
the Egyptians worshipped Typhon under the form of an ass; and according
to him Seth “appears gradually among the Semites as the background
of their religious
 <span class="lock">consciousness.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_921" id="FNanchor_921">[921]</a></span>
 The name of the ass in Coptic, <span class="allsmcap">AO</span>,
is a phonetic of <span class="smcap">Iao</span>, and hence the animal became a pun-symbol.
Thus Satan is a later creation, sprung from the overheated fancy of
the Fathers of the Church. By some reverse of fortune, to which the
gods are subjected in common with mortals, Typhon-Seth tumbled down
from the eminence of the deified son of Adam Kadmon, to the degrading
position of a subaltern spirit, a mythical demon—ass. Religious schisms
are as little free from the frail pettiness and spiteful feelings of humanity
as the partisan quarrels of laymen. We find a strong instance of the
above in the case of the Zoroastrian reform, when Magianism separated
from the old faith of the Brahmans. The bright Devas of the <cite>Veda</cite>
became, under the religious reform of Zoroaster, daêvas, or evil spirits, of
the <cite>Avesta</cite>. Even Indra, the luminous god, was thrust far back into the
dark
 <span class="lock">shadow<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_922" id="FNanchor_922">[922]</a></span>
 in order to show off, in a brighter light, Ahura-mazda, the
Wise and Supreme Deity.</p>

<p>The strange veneration in which the Ophites held the serpent which
represented Christos may become less perplexing if the students would
but remember that at all ages the serpent was the symbol of divine wisdom,
which kills in order to resurrect, destroys but to rebuild the better.
Moses is made a descendant of Levi, a serpent-tribe. Gautama-Buddha
is of a serpent-lineage, through the Naga (serpent) race of kings who
reigned in Magadha. Hermes, or the god Taaut (Thoth), in his snake-symbol
is Têt; and, according to the Ophite legends, Jesus or Christos
is born from a snake (divine wisdom, or Holy Ghost), <i>i.e.</i>, he became a
Son of God through his initiation into the “Serpent Science.” Vishnu,
identical with the Egyptian Kneph, rests on the heavenly <em>seven</em>-headed
serpent.</p>

<p>The red or fiery dragon of the ancient time was the military ensign
of the Assyrians. Cyrus adopted it from them when Persia became dominant.
The Romans and Byzantines next assumed it; and so the “great
red dragon,” from being the symbol of Babylon and Nineveh, became that
of <span class="lock">Rome.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_923" id="FNanchor_923">[923]</a></span></p>

<p>The temptation, or
 <span class="lock">probation,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_924" id="FNanchor_924">[924]</a></span>
 of Jesus is, however, the most dramatic

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">485</a></span>

occasion in which Satan appears. As if to prove the designation of Apollo,
Æsculapius, and Bacchus, <i>Diobolos</i>, or son of Zeus, he is also styled <i>Diabolos</i>,
or accuser. The scene of the probation was the wilderness. In
the desert about the Jordan and Dead Sea were the abodes of the “sons
of the prophets,” and the
 <span class="lock">Essenes.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_925" id="FNanchor_925">[925]</a></span>
 These ascetics used to subject their
neophytes to probations, analogous to the <em>tortures</em> of the Mithraic rites;
and the temptation of Jesus was evidently a scene of this character.
Hence, in the <cite>Gospel according to Luke</cite>, it is stated that “the Diabolos,
having completed the probation, left him for a specific time, αχρι καιροῦ;
and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.” But the
διαβολος, or Devil, in this instance is evidently no malignant principle,
but one exercising discipline. In this sense the terms Devil and Satan
are repeatedly
 <span class="lock">employed.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_926" id="FNanchor_926">[926]</a></span>
 Thus, when Paul was liable to undue elation
by reason of the abundance of revelations or epoptic disclosures, there
was given him “a thorn in the flesh, an angel of Satanas,” to check
<span class="lock">him.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_927" id="FNanchor_927">[927]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of Satan in the <cite>Book of Job</cite> is of a similar character. He
is introduced among the “Sons of God,” presenting themselves before
the Lord, as in a Mystic initiation. Micaiah the prophet describes a
similar scene, where he “saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the
host of Heaven standing by Him,” with whom He took counsel, which
resulted in putting “a lying spirit into the mouth of the prophets of
 <span class="lock">Ahab.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_928" id="FNanchor_928">[928]</a></span>
 The Lord counsels with Satan, and gives him <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i> to
test the fidelity of Job. He is stripped of his wealth and family, and
smitten with a loathsome disease. In his extremity, his wife doubts his
integrity, and exhorts him to worship God, as he is about to die. His
friends all beset him with accusations, and finally the Lord, the chief hierophant
Himself, taxes him with the uttering of words in which there is no
wisdom, and with contending with the Almighty. To this rebuke Job
yielded, making this appeal: “I will demand of thee, and thou shalt
declare unto me: wherefore do I abhor myself and mourn in dust and
ashes?” Immediately he was vindicated. “The Lord said unto Eliphaz
... ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant
Job hath.” His integrity had been asserted, and his prediction verified:
“I know that my Champion liveth, and that he will stand up for me at a
later time on the earth; and though after my skin my body itself be corroded
away, yet even then without my flesh shall I see God.” The prediction

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">486</a></span>

was accomplished: “I have heard of thee by the hearing of the
ear, but now mine eye seeth thee.... And the Lord turned the captivity
of Job.”</p>

<p>In all these scenes there is manifested no such malignant diabolism
as is supposed to characterize “the adversary of souls.”</p>

<p>It is an opinion of certain writers of merit and learning, that the
Satan of the book of <cite>Job</cite> is a Jewish myth, containing the Mazdean doctrine
of the Evil Principle. Dr. Haug remarks that “the Zoroastrian
religion exhibits a close affinity, or rather identity with the Mosaic religion
and Christianity, such as the personality and attributes of the Devil,
and the resurrection of the
 <span class="lock">dead.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_929" id="FNanchor_929">[929]</a></span>
 The war of the <cite>Apocalypse</cite> between
Michael and the Dragon, can be traced with equal facility to one of the
oldest myths of the Aryans. In the <cite>Avesta</cite> we read of war between
Thrætaona and Azhi-Dahaka, the destroying serpent. Burnouf has endeavored
to show that the Vedic myth of Ahi, or the serpent, fighting
against the gods, has been gradually euhemerized into “the battle of a
pious man against the power of evil,” in the Mazdean religion. By these
interpretations Satan would be made identical with Zohak or Azhi-Dahaka,
who is a three-headed serpent, with one of the heads a human
<span class="lock">one.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_930" id="FNanchor_930">[930]</a></span></p>

<p>Beel-Zebub is generally distinguished from Satan. He seems, in the
<cite>Apocryphal New Testament</cite>, to be regarded as the potentate of the
underworld. The name is usually rendered “Baal of the Flies,” which
may be a designation of the Scarabæi or sacred
 <span class="lock">beetles.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_931" id="FNanchor_931">[931]</a></span>
 More correctly
it shall be read, as it is always given in the Greek text of the <cite>Gospels</cite>,
Beelzebul, or lord of the household, as is indeed intimated in <cite>Matthew</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">487</a></span>

<abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 25: “If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how
much more shall they call them of his household.” He was also styled
the prince or archon of dæmons.</p>

<p>Typhon figures in the <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>, as the Accuser of souls when
they appear for judgment, as Satan stood up to accuse Joshua, the high-priest,
before the angel, and as the Devil came to Jesus to tempt or test
him during his great fast in the wilderness. He was also the deity denominated
Baal-Tsephon, or god of the crypt, in the book of <cite>Exodus</cite>,
and <i>Seth</i>, or the pillar. During this period, the ancient or archaic worship
was more or less under the ban of the government; in figurative language,
Osiris had been treacherously slain and cut in fourteen (twice
<em>seven</em>) pieces, and coffined by his brother Typhon, and Isis had gone to
Byblos in quest of his body.</p>

<p>We must not forget in this relation that Saba or Sabazios, of Phrygia
and Greece, was torn by the Titans into <em>seven</em> pieces, and that he was,
like Heptaktis of the Chaldeans, the <em>seven</em>-rayed god. Siva, the Hindu,
is represented crowned with seven serpents, and he is the god of war and
destruction. The Hebrew Jehovah the Sabaoth is also called the Lord of
hosts, Seba or Saba, Bacchus or Dionysus Sabazios; so that all these
may easily be proved identical.</p>

<p>Finally the princes of the older <i lang="fr">régime</i>, the gods who had, on the
assault of the giants, taken the forms of animals and hidden in Æthiopia,
returned and expelled the shepherds.</p>

<p>According to Josephus, the Hyk-sos were the ancestors of the
 <span class="lock">Israelites.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_932" id="FNanchor_932">[932]</a></span>
This is doubtless substantially true. The Hebrew <cite>Scriptures</cite>,
which tell a somewhat different story, were written at a later period, and
underwent several revisions, before they were promulgated with any degree
of publicity. Typhon became odious in Egypt, and shepherds “an
abomination.” “In the course of the twentieth dynasty he was suddenly
treated as an evil demon, insomuch that his effigies and name are
obliterated on all the monuments and inscriptions that could be
 <span class="lock">reached.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_933" id="FNanchor_933">[933]</a></span></p>

<p>In all ages the gods have been liable to be euhemerized into men.
There are tombs of Zeus, Apollo, Hercules, and Bacchus, which are often
mentioned to show that originally they were only mortals. Shem, Ham,
and Japhet, are traced in the divinities Shamas of Assyria, Kham of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">488</a></span>

Egypt, and Iapetos the Titan. Seth was god of the Hyk-sos, Enoch, or
Inachus, of the Argives; and Abraham, Isaac, and Judah have been compared
with Brahma, Ikshwaka, and Yadu of the Hindu pantheon. Typhon
tumbled down from godhead to devilship, both in his own character
as brother of Osiris, and as the Seth, or Satan of Asia. Apollo, the god
of day, became, in his older Phœnician garb, no more Baal Zebul, the
Oracle-god, but prince of demons, and finally the lord of the underworld.
The separation of Mazdeanism from Vedism, transformed the <i>devas</i> or
gods into evil potencies. Indra, also, in the <cite>Vendidad</cite> is set forth as the
subaltern of Ahriman,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_934" id="FNanchor_934">[934]</a>
 created by him out of the materials of
 <span class="lock">darkness,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_935" id="FNanchor_935">[935]</a></span>
together with Siva (Surya) and the two Aswins. Even Jahi is the demon
of Lust—probably identical with Indra.</p>

<p>The several tribes and nations had their tutelar gods, and vilified
those of inimical peoples. The transformation of Typhon, Satan and
Beelzebub are of this character. Indeed, Tertullian speaks of Mithra,
the god of the Mysteries, as a devil.</p>

<p>In the twelfth chapter of the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>, Michael and his angels
overcame the Dragon and his angels: “and the Great Dragon was cast
out, that Archaic Ophis, called Diabolos and Satan, that deceiveth the
whole world.” It is added: “They overcame him by the blood of the
Lamb.” The Lamb, or Christ, had to descend himself to hell, the world
of the dead, and remain there three days before he subjugated the enemy,
according to the myth.</p>

<p>Michael was denominated by the kabalists and the Gnostics, “the
Saviour,” the angel of the Sun, and angel of Light. (מיכאל, probably,
from יכח <a id="hebrew21"></a> to manifest and אל God.) He was the first of the Æons, and
was well-known to antiquarians as the “unknown angel” represented
on the Gnostic amulets.</p>

<p>The writer of the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>, if not a kabalist, must have been a
Gnostic. Michael was not a personage originally exhibited to him in
his vision (epopteia) but the Saviour and Dragon-slayer. Archæological
explorations have indicated him as identical with Anubis, whose effigy
was lately discovered upon an Egyptian monument, with a cuirass and
holding a spear, like <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Michael and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George. He is also represented
as slaying a Dragon, that has the head and tail of a
 <span class="lock">serpent.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_936" id="FNanchor_936">[936]</a></span></p>

<p>The student of Lepsius, Champollion, and other Egyptologists will

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489">489</a></span>

quickly recognize Isis as the “woman with child,” “clothed with the Sun
and with the Moon under her feet,” whom the “great fiery Dragon” persecuted,
and to whom “were given two wings of the Great Eagle that
she might fly into the wilderness.” Typhon was
 <span class="lock">red-skinned.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_937" id="FNanchor_937">[937]</a></span></p>

<p>The Two Brothers, the Good and Evil Principles, appear in the
Myths of the <cite>Bible</cite> as well as those of the Gentiles, and Cain and Abel,
Typhon and Osiris, Esau and Jacob, Apollo and Python, etc., Esau or
Osu, is represented, when born, as “red all over like as hairy garment.”
He is the Typhon or Satan, opposing his brother.</p>

<p>From the remotest antiquity the serpent was held by every people in
the greatest veneration, as the embodiment of Divine wisdom and the
symbol of spirit, and we know from Sanchoniathon that it was Hermes or
Thoth who was the first to regard the serpent as “the most spirit-like of
all the reptiles;” and the Gnostic serpent with the seven vowels over
the head is but the copy of Ananta, the seven-headed serpent on which
rests the god Vishnu.</p>

<p>We have experienced no little surprise to find upon reading the latest
European treatises upon serpent-worship, that the writers confess that the
public is “still almost in the dark as to the origin of the superstition in
question.” Mr. C. Staniland Wake, M.A.I., from whom we now quote,
says: “The student of mythology knows that certain ideas were associated
by the peoples of antiquity with the serpent, and that it was the
favorite symbol of particular deities; but why that animal rather than any
other was chosen for the purpose is yet
 <span class="lock">uncertain.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_938" id="FNanchor_938">[938]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. James Fergusson, F.R.S., who has gathered together such an
abundance of material upon this ancient cult, seems to have no more
suspicion of the truth than the
 <span class="lock">rest.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_939" id="FNanchor_939">[939]</a></span></p>

<p>Our explanation of the myth may be of little value to students of
symbology, and yet we believe that the interpretation of the primitive
serpent-worship as given by the initiates is the correct one. In
 <abbr title="Volume one, page">Vol. i., p.</abbr>
10, we quote from the serpent Mantra, in the <cite>Aytareya-Brahmana</cite>, a
passage which speaks of the earth as the <i>Sarpa Râjni</i>, the Queen of the
Serpents, and “the mother of all that moves.” These expressions refer
to the fact that before our globe had become egg-shaped or round it was
a long trail of cosmic dust or fire-mist, moving and writhing like a serpent.
This, say the explanations, was the Spirit of God moving on the chaos
until its breath had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume the
annular shape of a serpent with its tail in its mouth—emblem of eternity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">490</a></span>

in its spiritual and of our world in its physical sense. According to the
notions of the oldest philosophers, as we have shown in the preceding
chapter, the earth, serpent-like, casts off its skin and appears after every
minor pralaya in a rejuvenated state, and after the great pralaya resurrects
or evolves again from its subjective into objective existence. Like
the serpent, it not only “puts off its old age,” says Sanchoniathon, “but
increases in size and strength.” This is why not only Serapis, and later,
Jesus, were represented by a great serpent, but even why, in our own
century, big snakes are kept with sacred care in Moslem mosques; for
instance, in that of Cairo. In Upper Egypt a famous saint is said to
appear under the form of a large serpent; and in India in some children’s
cradles a pair of serpents, male and female, are reared with the infant,
and snakes are often kept in houses, as they are thought to bring (a
magnetic aura of) wisdom, health, and good luck. They are the progeny
of Sarpa Râjni, the earth, and endowed with all her virtues.</p>

<p>In the Hindu mythology Vasaki, the Great Dragon, pours forth upon
Durga, from his mouth, a poisonous fluid which overspreads the ground, but
her consort Siva caused the earth to open her mouth and swallow it.</p>

<p>Thus the mystic drama of the celestial virgin pursued by the dragon
seeking to devour her child, was not only depicted in the constellations
of heaven, as has been mentioned, but was represented in the secret worship
of the temples. It was the mystery of the god Sol, and inscribed
on a black image of
 <span class="lock">Isis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_940" id="FNanchor_940">[940]</a></span>
 The Divine Boy was chased by the cruel
 <span class="lock">Typhon.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_941" id="FNanchor_941">[941]</a></span>
 In an Egyptian legend the Dragon is said to pursue Thuesis
(Isis) while she is endeavoring to protect her
 <span class="lock">son.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_942" id="FNanchor_942">[942]</a></span>
 Ovid describes
Dioné (the consort of the original Pelasgian Zeus, and mother of Venus)
as flying from Typhon to the
 <span class="lock">Euphrates,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_943" id="FNanchor_943">[943]</a></span>
 thus identifying the myth as
belonging to all the countries where the Mysteries were celebrated.
Virgil sings the victory:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Hail, dear child of gods, great son of Jove!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Receive the honors great; the time is at hand;</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Albertus Magnus, himself an alchemist and student of occult science,
as well as a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church, in his enthusiasm for
astrology, declared that the zodiacal sign of the celestial virgin rises above
the horizon on the twenty-fifth of December, at the moment assigned by
the Church for the birth of the
 <span class="lock">Saviour.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_945" id="FNanchor_945">[945]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">491</a></span>

The sign and myth of the mother and child were known thousands of
years before the Christian era. The drama of the Mysteries of Demeter
represents Persephoneia, her daughter, as carried away by Pluto or Hades
into the world of the dead; and when the mother finally discovers her
there, she has been installed as queen of the realm of Darkness. This
myth was transcribed by the Church into the legend
 <span class="lock">of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anna<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_946" id="FNanchor_946">[946]</a></span>
 going
in quest of her daughter Mary, who has been conveyed by Joseph into
Egypt. Persephoné is depicted with two ears of wheat in her hand; so
is Mary in the old pictures; so was the Celestial Virgin of the constellation.
Albumazar the Arabian indicates the identity of the several myths
as follows:</p>

<p>“In the first decan of the Virgin rises a maid, called in Arabic Aderenosa
[Adha-nari?], that is, pure immaculate
 <span class="lock">virgin,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_947" id="FNanchor_947">[947]</a></span>
 graceful in person,
charming in countenance, modest in habit, with loosened hair, holding in
her hands two ears of wheat, sitting upon an embroidered throne, nursing
a boy, and rightly feeding him in the place called Hebræa; a boy, I
say, named Iessus by certain nations, which signifies Issa, whom they also
call Christ in
 <span class="lock">Greek.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_948" id="FNanchor_948">[948]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time Grecian, Asiatic, and Egyptian ideas had undergone a
remarkable transformation. The Mysteries of Dionysus-Sabazius had
been replaced by the rites of Mithras, whose “caves” superseded the
crypts of the former god, from Babylon to Britain. Serapis, or Sri-Apa,
from Pontus, had usurped the place of Osiris. The king of Eastern Hindustan,
Asoka, had embraced the religion of Siddhârtha, and sent missionaries
clear to Greece, Asia, Syria, and Egypt, to promulgate the evangel
of wisdom. The Essenes of Judea and Arabia, the
 <span class="lock">Therapeutists<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_949" id="FNanchor_949">[949]</a></span>
 of
Egypt, and the
 <span class="lock">Pythagorists<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_950" id="FNanchor_950">[950]</a></span>
 of Greece and Magna Græcia, were evidently
religionists of the new faith. The legends of Gautama superseded
the myths of Horus, Anubis, Adonis, Atys, and Bacchus. These were
wrought anew into the Mysteries and Gospels, and to them we owe the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">492</a></span>

literature known as the <cite>Evangelists</cite> and the <cite>Apocryphal New Testament</cite>.
They were kept by the Ebionites, Nazarenes, and other sects as sacred
books, which they might “show only to the wise;” and were so preserved
till the overshadowing influence of the Roman ecclesiastical polity was
able to wrest them from those who kept them.</p>

<p>At the time that the high-priest Hilkiah is said to have found the
<i>Book of the Law</i>, the Hindu <cite>Puranas</cite> (Scriptures) were known to the
Assyrians. These last had for many centuries held dominion from the
Hellespont to the Indus, and probably crowded the Aryans out of Bactriana
into the Punjâb. The <cite>Book of the Law</cite> seems to have been a
<i>purana</i>. “The learned Brahmans,” says Sir William Jones, “pretend
that five conditions are requisite to constitute a real <i>purana</i>:</p>

<p>“1. To treat of the creation of matter in general.</p>

<p>“2. To treat of <em>the creation or production of secondary material and
spiritual beings</em>.</p>

<p>“3. To give a chronological abridgment of the great periods of time.</p>

<p>“4. To give a genealogical abridgment of the principal families that
reigned over the country.</p>

<p>“5. Lastly, to give the history of some great man in particular.”</p>

<p>It is pretty certain that whoever wrote the <cite>Pentateuch</cite> had this plan
before him, as well as those who wrote the <cite>New Testament</cite> had become
thoroughly well acquainted with Buddhistic ritualistic worship, legends
and doctrines, through the Buddhist missionaries who were many in those
days in Palestine and Greece.</p>

<p>But “no Devil, no Christ.” This is the basic dogma of the Church.
We must hunt the two together. There is a mysterious connection
between the two, more close than perhaps is suspected, amounting to
identity. If we collect together the mythical sons of God, all of whom
were regarded as “first-begotten,” they will be found dovetailing together
and blending in this dual character. Adam Kadmon bifurcates from the
spiritual conceptive wisdom into the creative one, which evolves <i>matter</i>.
The Adam made from dust is both son of God and Satan; and the latter
is also a son of
 <span class="lock">God,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_951" id="FNanchor_951">[951]</a></span>
 according to Job.</p>

<p>Hercules was likewise “the First-Begotten.” He is also Bel, Baal,
and Bal, and therefore Siva, the Destroyer. Bacchus was styled by
Euripides, “Bacchus, the Son of God.” As a child, Bacchus, like the
Jesus of the <cite>Apocryphal Gospels</cite>, was greatly dreaded. He is described
as benevolent to mankind; nevertheless he was merciless in punishing
whomever failed of respect to his worship. Pentheus, the son of Cadmus

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">493</a></span>

and Hermioné, was, like the son of Rabbi Hannon, destroyed for his
want of piety.</p>

<p>The allegory of Job, which has been already cited, if correctly understood,
will give the key to this whole matter of the Devil, his nature and
office; and will substantiate our declarations. Let no pious individual
take exception to this designation of allegory. Myth was the favorite
and universal method of teaching in archaic times. Paul, writing to the
Corinthians, declared that the entire story of Moses and the Israelites
was
 <span class="lock">typical;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_952" id="FNanchor_952">[952]</a></span>
 and in his <cite>Epistle to the Galatians</cite>, asserted that the whole
story of Abraham, his two wives, and their sons was an
 <span class="lock">allegory.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_953" id="FNanchor_953">[953]</a></span>
Indeed, it is a theory amounting to certitude, that the historical books
of the <cite>Old Testament</cite> were of the same character. We take no extraordinary
liberty with the <cite>Book of Job</cite> when we give it the same designation
which Paul gave the stories of Abraham and Moses.</p>

<p>But we ought, perhaps, to explain the ancient use of allegory and
symbology. The truth in the former was left to be deduced; the symbol
expressed some abstract quality of the Deity, which the laity could easily
apprehend. Its higher sense terminated there; and it was employed by
the multitude thenceforth as an image to be employed in idolatrous rites.
But the allegory was reserved for the inner sanctuary, when only the
elect were admitted. Hence the rejoinder of Jesus when his disciples
interrogated him because he spoke to the multitude in parables. “To
you,” said he, “it is given to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of
Heaven, but to them it is not given. For whosoever hath, to him
shall be given, and he shall have more abundance; but whosoever hath
not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.” In the minor
Mysteries a sow was washed to typify the purification of the neophyte;
as her return to the mire indicated the superficial nature of the work
that had been accomplished.</p>

<p>“The Mythus is the undisclosed thought of the soul. The characteristic
trait of the myth is to convert reflection into history (a historical
form). As in the epos, so in the myth, the historical element predominates.
Facts (external events) often constitute the basis of the myth,
and with these, religious ideas are interwoven.”</p>

<p>The whole allegory of Job is an open book to him who understands
the picture-language of Egypt as it is recorded in <cite>the Book of the Dead</cite>.
In the Scene of Judgment, Osiris is represented sitting on his throne,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">494</a></span>

holding in one hand the symbol of life, “the hook of attraction,” and in
the other the mystic Bacchic fan. Before him are the sons of God, the
forty-two assessors of the dead. An altar is immediately before the
throne, covered with gifts and surmounted with the sacred lotus-flower,
upon which stand four spirits. By the entrance stands the soul about to
be judged, whom Thmei, the genius of Truth, is welcoming to this conclusion
of the probation. Thoth holding a reed, makes a record of the
proceedings in the Book of Life. Horus and Anubis, standing by the
scales, inspect the weight which determines whether the heart of the
deceased balances the symbol of truth, or the latter preponderates. On
a pedestal sits a bitch—the symbol of the Accuser.</p>

<p>Initiation into the Mysteries, as every intelligent person knows, was
a dramatic representation of scenes in the underworld. Such was the
allegory of Job.</p>

<p>Several critics have attributed the authorship of this book to Moses.
But it is older than the <cite>Pentateuch</cite>. Jehovah is not mentioned in the
poem itself; and if the name occurs in the prologue, the fact must be
attributed to either an error of the translators, or the premeditation
exacted by the later necessity to transform polytheism into a monotheistic
religion. The plan adopted was the very simple one of attributing
the many names of the Elohim (gods) to a single god. So in
one of the oldest Hebrew texts of Job (in chapter <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 9) there stands
the name of Jehovah, whereas all other manuscripts have “Adonai.”
But in the original poem Jehovah is absent. In place of this name we
find <i>Al</i>, <i>Aleim</i>, <i>Ale</i>, <i>Shaddai</i>, <i>Adonai</i>, etc. Therefore, we must conclude
that either the prologue and epilogue were added at a later period,
which is inadmissible for many reasons, or that it has been tampered
with like the rest of the manuscripts. Then, we find in this archaic
poem no mention whatever of the Sabbatical Institution; but a great
many references to the sacred number seven, of which we will speak
further, and a direct discussion upon Sabeanism, the worship of the
heavenly bodies prevailing in those days in Arabia. Satan is called in
it a “Son of God,” one of the council which presents itself before God,
and he leads him into tempting Job’s fidelity. In this poem, clearer and
plainer than anywhere else, do we find the meaning of the appellation,
Satan. It is a term for the office or character of <em>public accuser</em>. Satan
is the Typhon of the Egyptians, barking his accusations in Amenthi; an
office quite as respectable as that of the public prosecutor, in our own
age; and if, through the ignorance of the first Christians, he became
later identical with the Devil, it is through no connivance of his own.</p>

<p>The <cite>Book of Job</cite> is a complete representation of ancient initiation,
and the trials which generally precede this grandest of all ceremonies.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">495</a></span>

The neophyte perceives himself deprived of everything he valued, and
afflicted with foul disease. His wife appeals to him to adore God and
die; there was no more hope for him. Three friends appear on the
scene by mutual appointment: Eliphaz, the learned Temanite, full of
the knowledge “which wise men have told from their fathers—to whom
alone the earth was given;” Bildad, the conservative, taking matters as
they come, and judging Job to have done wickedly, because he was
afflicted; and Zophar, intelligent and skilful with “generalities” but
not interiorly wise. Job boldly responds: “If I have erred, it is a
matter with myself. You magnify yourselves and plead against me in
my reproach; but it is God who has overthrown me. Why do you persecute
me and are not satisfied with my flesh thus wasted away? But I
know that my Champion lives, and that at a coming day he will stand
for me in the earth; and though, together with my skin, all this beneath
it shall be destroyed, yet without my flesh I shall see God.... Ye shall
say: ‘Why do we molest him?’ for the root of the matter is found in
me!”</p>

<p>This passage, like all others in which the faintest allusions could be
found to a “Champion,” “Deliverer,” or “Vindicator,” was interpreted
into a direct reference to the Messiah; but apart from the fact that in
the Septuagint this verse is translated:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“For I know that He is eternal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who is about to deliver me on earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To restore this skin of mine which endures these things,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In King James’s version, as it stands translated, it has no resemblance
whatever to the
 <span class="lock">original.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_954" id="FNanchor_954">[954]</a></span>
 The crafty translators have rendered it, “I
know that <em>my Redeemer liveth</em>,” etc. And yet <i>Septuagint</i>, <i>Vulgate</i>, and
Hebrew original, have all to be considered as an inspired Word of God.
Job refers to his own <em>immortal</em> spirit which is eternal, and which, when
death comes, will deliver him from his putrid earthly body and clothe him
with a new spiritual envelope. In the <cite>Mysteries of Eleusinia</cite>, in the
Egyptian <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>, and all other works treating on matters of
initiation, this “eternal being” has a name. With the Neo-platonists it
was the <i>Nous</i>, the <i>Augoeides</i>; with the Buddhists it is <i>Aggra</i>; and with
the Persians, <i>Ferwer</i>. All of these are called the “Deliverers,” the
“Champions,” the “Metatrons,” etc. In the Mithraic sculptures of
Persia, the <i>ferwer</i> is represented by a winged figure hovering in the air
above its “object” or
 <span class="lock">body.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_955" id="FNanchor_955">[955]</a></span>
 It is the luminous Self—the Âtman of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">496</a></span>

the Hindus, our immortal spirit, who alone can redeem our soul; and
will, if we follow him instead of being dragged down by our body.
Therefore, in the Chaldean texts, the above reads, “My <em>deliverer</em>, my
<em>restorer</em>,” <i>i.e.</i>, the Spirit who will restore the decayed body of man, and
transform it into a clothing of ether. And it is this <i>Nous</i>, <i>Augoeides</i>,
<i>Ferwer</i>, <i>Aggra</i>, Spirit of himself, that the triumphant Job shall see without
his flesh—<i>i.e.</i>, when he has escaped from his bodily prison, and that
the translators call “God.”</p>

<p>Not only is there not the slightest allusion in the poem of Job to
Christ, but it is now well proved that all those versions by different translators,
which agree with that of king James, were written on the authority
of Jerome, who has taken strange liberties in his <cite>Vulgate</cite>. He was
the first to cram into the text this verse of his own fabrication:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“<i>I know that my Redeemer lives</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And at the last day <i>I shall arise from the earth</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And again shall be surrounded with my skin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in my flesh I shall see my God.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>All of which might have been a good reason for himself to believe in
it since <em>he knew it</em>, but for others who did <em>not</em>, and who moreover
found in the text a quite different idea, it only proves that Jerome had
decided, by one more interpolation, to enforce the dogma of a resurrection
“at the last day,” and in the identical skin and bones which we had used
on earth. This is an agreeable prospect of “restoration” indeed. Why
not the linen also, in which the body happens to die?</p>

<p>And how could the author of the <cite>Book of Job</cite> know anything of the
<cite>New Testament</cite>, when evidently he was utterly ignorant even of the <i>Old</i>
one? There is a total absence of allusion to any of the patriarchs;
and so evidently is it the work of an <i>Initiate</i>, that one of the three daughters
of Job is even called by a decidedly “Pagan” mythological name.
The name of <i>Kerenhappuch</i> is rendered in various ways by the many
translators. The <cite>Vulgate</cite> has “horn of antimony;” and the LXX has the
“horn of Amalthea,” the nurse of Jupiter, and one of the constellations,
emblem of the “horn of plenty.” The presence in the <i>Septuagint</i> of this
heroine of Pagan fable, shows the ignorance of the transcribers of its
meaning as well as the esoteric origin of the <cite>Book of Job</cite>.</p>

<p>Instead of offering consolations, the three friends of the suffering Job
seek to make him believe that his misfortune must have come in punishment
of some extraordinary transgressions on his part. Hurling back
upon them all their imputations, Job swears that while his breath is in him
he will maintain his cause. He takes in view the period of his prosperity
“when the secret of God was upon his tabernacles,” and he was a judge

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">497</a></span>

“who sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, or one that comforteth the
mourners,” and compares with it the present time—when vagrant Bedouins
held him in derision, men “viler than the earth,” when he was prostrated
by misfortune and foul disease. Then he asserts his sympathy for the
unfortunate, his chastity, his integrity, his probity, his strict justice, his
charities, his moderation, his freedom from the prevalent sun-worship, his
tenderness to enemies, his hospitality to strangers, his openness of heart,
his boldness for the right, though he encountered the multitude and the
contempt of families; and invokes the Almighty to answer him, and his
adversary to write down of what he had been guilty.</p>

<p>To this there was not, and could not be, any answer. The three had
sought to crush Job by pleadings and general arguments, and he had demanded
consideration for his specific acts. Then appeared the fourth;
Elihu, the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of
 <span class="lock">Ram.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_956" id="FNanchor_956">[956]</a></span></p>

<p>Elihu is the hierophant; he begins with a rebuke, and the sophisms
of Job’s false friends are swept away like the loose sand before the west
wind.</p>

<p>“And Elihu, the son of Barachel, spoke and said: ‘Great men are
not always wise ... there <em>is</em> a spirit in man; the <em>spirit within me</em>
constraineth me.... God speaketh once, yea twice, <em>yet man</em> perceiveth
it not. In a dream; in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
upon man, in slumberings upon the bed; then he openeth the ears of men,
and sealeth their instruction. O Job, hearken unto me; hold thy peace,
and I shall teach thee <span class="allsmcap">WISDOM</span>.’”</p>

<p>And Job, who to the dogmatic fallacies of his three friends in the bitterness
of his heart had exclaimed: “No doubt but ye are <em>the</em> people,
and wisdom shall die with you.... Miserable comforters are ye all....
Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
But <i>ye</i> are forgers of lies, <em>ye</em> are physicians of no value!” The sore-eaten,
visited Job, who in the face of the official clergy—offering for all
hope the necessarianism of damnation, had in his despair nearly wavered in
his patient faith, answered: “What <em>ye</em> know, <em>the same</em> do I know also;
I am not inferior unto you.... Man cometh forth like a flower, and
is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, <em>and continueth not</em>.... Man
dieth, and wasteth away, yea, man giveth up the ghost, and <em>where is
he?</em>... If a man die shall he <em>live</em> again?... When a few years are
come then I shall go the way <em>whence</em> I shall not return.... O that
one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbor!”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">498</a></span>

Job finds one who answers to his cry of agony. He listens to the wisdom
of Elihu, the hierophant, the perfected teacher, the inspired philosopher.
From his stern lips comes the just rebuke for his impiety in
charging upon the <span class="smcap">Supreme</span> Being the evils of humanity. “God,” says
Elihu, “is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice;
<span class="smcap">He</span> <em>will not afflict</em>.”</p>

<p>So long as the neophyte was satisfied with his own worldly wisdom
and irreverent estimate of the Deity and His purposes; so long as he
gave ear to the pernicious sophistries of his advisers, the hierophant kept
silent. But, when this anxious mind was ready for counsel and instruction,
his voice is heard, and he speaks with the authority of the Spirit
of God that “constraineth” him: “Surely God will not hear <em>vanity</em>, neither
will the Almighty regard it.... He respecteth not any that are
wise at heart.”</p>

<p>What better commentary than this upon the fashionable preacher,
who “<em>multiplieth</em> words without knowledge!” This magnificent <em>prophetic</em>
satire might have been written to prefigure the spirit that prevails
in all the denominations of Christians.</p>

<p>Job hearkens to the words of wisdom, and then the “Lord” answers
Job “out of the whirlwind” of nature, God’s first visible manifestation:
“Stand still, O Job, stand still! and consider the wondrous works of
God; for <em>by them alone</em> thou canst know God. ‘Behold, God is great,
and <em>we know him not</em>,’ Him who ‘maketh small the drops of water; <em>but
they</em> pour down rain <em>according to the vapor</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>thereof</em>;’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_957" id="FNanchor_957">[957]</a></span>
 not according to
the divine whim, but to the once established and immutable laws. Which
law “removeth the mountains and they know not; which shaketh the
earth; which commandeth the sun, and <em>it riseth not</em>; and sealeth up the
stars; ... which doeth great things <em>past finding out</em>; yea, and <i>wonders
without number</i>.... Lo, <em>He goeth by me</em>, and I see <em>him not</em>; he passeth
on also, but <em>I perceive him</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>not</em>!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_958" id="FNanchor_958">[958]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, “Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without
 <span class="lock">knowledge?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_959" id="FNanchor_959">[959]</a></span>
speaks the voice of God through His mouthpiece—nature.
“Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if
thou hast understanding. Who hath laid the measures thereof, <em>if thou
knowest</em>? When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of
God shouted for joy?... Wast thou present when I said to the seas,
‘Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud
waves be stayed?’... Knowest thou who hath caused it to rain on
the earth, <em>where no man is</em>; on the wilderness, wherein <em>there is no man</em>....
Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">499</a></span>

of Orion?... Canst thou <em>send lightnings</em>, that they may go, and say
unto thee, ‘Here we
 <span class="lock">are?’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_960" id="FNanchor_960">[960]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then Job answered the Lord.” He understood His ways, and his
eyes were opened for the first time. The Supreme Wisdom descended
upon him; and if the reader remain puzzled before this final <span class="smcap">Petroma</span> of
initiation, at least Job, or the man “afflicted” in his blindness, then realized
the impossibility of catching “Leviathan by putting a hook into his
nose.” The Leviathan is <span class="allsmcap">OCCULT SCIENCE</span>, on which one can lay his
hand, but “<em>do no</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>more</em>,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_961" id="FNanchor_961">[961]</a></span>
 whose power and “comely proportion” God
wishes not to conceal.</p>

<p>“Who can discover the face of his garment, or who can come to him
with his <em>double bridle</em>? Who can open the doors of his face, ‘of him
whose <em>scales</em> are his pride, shut up together as <em>with a closed seal</em>?’
Through whose ‘neesings a light doth shine,’ and whose eyes are like
the lids of the morning.” Who “maketh a light to <em>shine</em> after him,” for
those who have the fearlessness to approach him. And then they, like
him, will behold “all <em>high</em> things, for he is king only over all the children
of <span class="lock">pride.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_962" id="FNanchor_962">[962]</a></span></p>

<p>Job, now in modest confidence, responded:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“I know that thou canst do everything,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that no thought of thine can be resisted.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who is he that maketh a show of arcane wisdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of which he knoweth nothing?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus have I uttered what I did not <span class="lock">comprehend—</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Things far above me, which I did not know.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hear! I beseech thee, and I will speak;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will demand of thee, and do thou answer me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have heard thee with my ears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now I see thee with my eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wherefore am I loathsome,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And mourn in dust and ashes?”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>He recognized his “champion,” and was assured that the time for
his vindication had come. Immediately the Lord (“the priests and the
judges,” <cite>Deuteronomy</cite> <abbr title="nineteen">xix.</abbr> 17) saith to his friends: “My wrath is kindled
against thee and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken
of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.” So “the Lord
turned the captivity of Job,” and “blessed the latter end of Job more
than his beginning.”</p>

<p>Then in the judgment the deceased invokes four spirits who preside
over the Lake of Fire, and is purified by them. He then is conducted to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">500</a></span>

his celestial house, and is received by Athar and Isis, and stands before
 <span class="lock"><i>Atum</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_963" id="FNanchor_963">[963]</a></span>
 the essential God. He is now <i>Turu</i>, the essential man, a pure
spirit, and henceforth On-ati, the eye of fire, and an associate of the
gods.</p>

<p>This grandiose poem of Job was well understood by the kabalists.
While many of the mediæval Hermetists were profoundly religious men,
they were, in their innermost hearts—like kabalists of every age—the
deadliest enemies of the clergy. How true the words of Paracelsus when
worried by fierce persecution and slander, misunderstood by friends and
foes, abused by clergy and laity, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>“O ye of Paris, Padua, Montpellier, Salerno, Vienna, and Leipzig!
Ye are not teachers of the truth, but confessors of lies. Your philosophy
is a lie. Would you know <em>what</em> <span class="allsmcap">MAGIC</span> <em>really is</em>, then seek it in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John’s
<cite>Revelation</cite>.... As you cannot yourselves prove your teachings from the
<cite>Bible</cite> and the <cite>Revelation</cite>, then let your farces have an end. The <em>Bible
is the true key and interpreter</em>. John, not less than Moses, Elias, Enoch,
David, Solomon, Daniel, Jeremiah, and the rest of the prophets, was a
<em>magician</em>, kabalist, and diviner. If now, all, or even any of those I have
named, were yet living, I do not doubt that you would make an example
of them in your miserable slaughter-house, and would annihilate them
there on the spot, and <em>if</em> it were possible, the Creator of all things too!”</p>

<p>That Paracelsus had learned some mysterious and useful things out
of <cite>Revelation</cite> and other <cite>Bible</cite> books, as well as from the <cite>Kabala</cite>, was
proved by him practically; so much so, that he is called by many the
“father of magic and founder of the occult physics of the <cite>Kabala</cite> and
<span class="lock">magnetism.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_964" id="FNanchor_964">[964]</a></span></p>

<p>So firm was the popular belief in the supernatural powers of Paracelsus,
that to this day the tradition survives among the simple-minded
Alsatians that he is not dead, but “sleepeth in his grave” at
 <span class="lock">Strasburg.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_965" id="FNanchor_965">[965]</a></span>
And they often whisper among themselves that the green sod heaves with
every respiration of that weary breast, and that deep groans are heard as
the great fire-philosopher awakes to the remembrance of the cruel wrongs
he suffered at the hands of his cruel slanderers for the sake of the great
truth!</p>

<p>It will be perceived from these extended illustrations that the Satan
of the <cite>Old Testament</cite>, the Diabolos or Devil of the <cite>Gospels</cite> and <cite>Apostolic
Epistles</cite>, were but the antagonistic principle in matter, necessarily incident
to it, and not wicked in the moral sense of the term. The Jews,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">501</a></span>

coming from the Persian country, brought with them the doctrine of <em>two
principles</em>. They could not bring the <cite>Avesta</cite>, for it was not written. But
they—we mean the <i>Astdians</i> and <i>Pharsi</i>—invested Ormazd with the
secret name of יהוה, and Ahriman with the name of the gods of the land,
Satan of the Hittites, and <i>Diabolos</i>, or rather Diobolos, of the Greeks.
The early Church, at least the Pauline part of it, the Gnostics and their
successors, further refined upon their ideas; and the Catholic Church
adopted and adapted them, meanwhile putting their promulgators to the
sword.</p>

<p>The Protestant is a reaction from the Roman Catholic Church. It is
necessarily not coherent in its parts, but a prodigious host of fragments
beating their way round a common centre, attracting and repelling each
other. Parts are centripetally impelled towards old Rome, or the system
which enabled old Rome to exist; part still recoil under the centrifugal
impulse, and seek to rush into the broad ethereal region beyond Roman,
or even Christian influence.</p>

<p>The modern Devil is their principal heritage from the Roman Cybelè,
“Babylon, the Great Mother of the idolatrous and abominable religions
of the earth.”</p>

<p>But it may be argued, perhaps, that Hindu theology, both Brahmanical
and Buddhistic, is as strongly impregnated with belief in objective
devils as Christianity itself. There is a slight difference. This very
<em>subtlety</em> of the Hindu mind is a sufficient warrant that the well-educated
people, the learned portion, at least, of the Brahman and Buddhist
divines, consider the Devil in another light. With them the Devil is a
metaphysical abstraction, an allegory of necessary <em>evil</em>; while <em>with
Christians the myth has become a historical entity, the fundamental stone
on which Christianity, with its dogma of redemption, is built</em>. He is as
necessary—as Des Mousseaux has shown—to the Church as the beast
of the seventeenth chapter of the <cite>Apocalypse</cite> was to his rider. The
English-speaking Protestants, not finding the <cite>Bible</cite> explicit enough, have
adopted the <em>Diabology</em> of Milton’s celebrated poem, <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>,
embellishing it somewhat from Goethe’s celebrated drama of <cite>Faust</cite>.
John Milton, first a Puritan and finally a Quietist and Unitarian, never
put forth his great production except as a work of fiction, but it thoroughly
dovetailed together the different parts of Scripture. The Ilda-Baoth
of the Ophites was transformed into an angel of light, and the
morning star, and made the Devil in the first act of the <cite>Diabolic Drama</cite>.
Then the twelfth chapter of the <cite>Apocalypse</cite> was brought in for the second
act. The great red Dragon was adopted as the same illustrious personage
as <i>Lucifer</i>, and the last scene is his fall, like that of Vulcan-Hephaistos,
from Heaven into the island of Lemnos; the fugitive hosts and their

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">502</a></span>

leader “coming to hard bottom” in Pandemonium. The third act is the
Garden of Eden. Satan holds a council in a hall erected by him for his
new empire, and determines to go forth on an exploring expedition in
quest of the new world. The next acts relate to the fall of man, his
career on earth, the advent of the Logos, or Son of God, and his redemption
of mankind, or the elect portion of them, as the case may be.</p>

<p>This drama of <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> comprises the unformulated belief of
English-speaking “evangelical Protestant Christians.” Disbelief of its
main features is equivalent, in their view, to “denying Christ” and “blaspheming
against the Holy Ghost.” If John Milton had supposed that
his poem, instead of being regarded as a companion of Dante’s <cite>Divine
Comedy</cite>, would have been considered as another <cite>Apocalypse</cite> to supplement
the <cite>Bible</cite>, and complete its demonology, it is more than probable
that he would have borne his poverty more resolutely, and withheld it
from the press. A later poet, Robert Pollok, taking his cue from this
work, wrote another, <cite>The Course of Time</cite>, which bade fair for a season
to take the rank of a later <em>Scripture</em>; but the nineteenth century has
fortunately received a different inspiration, and the Scotch poet is falling
into oblivion.</p>

<p>We ought, perhaps, to make a brief notice of the European Devil. He
is the genius who deals in sorcery, witchcraft, and other mischief. The
Fathers taking the idea from the Jewish Pharisees, made devils of the
Pagan gods, Mithras, Serapis, and the others. The Roman Catholic
Church followed by denouncing the former worship as commerce with the
powers of darkness. The <i lang="la">malefecii</i> and witches of the middle ages were
thus but the votaries of the proscribed worship. Magic in all ancient
times had been considered as divine science, wisdom, and the knowledge
of God. The healing art in the temples of Æsculapius, and at the shrines of
Egypt and the East, had always been magical. Even Darius Hystaspes,
who had exterminated the Median Magi, and even driven out the Chaldean
theurgists from Babylon into Asia Minor, had also been instructed
by the Brahmans of Upper Asia, and, finally, while establishing the worship
of Ormazd, was also himself denominated the instituter of magism.
All was now changed. Ignorance was enthroned as the mother of devotion.
Learning was denounced, and savants prosecuted the sciences in
peril of their lives. They were compelled to employ a jargon to conceal
their ideas from all but their own adepts, and to accept opprobrium,
calumny, and poverty.</p>

<p>The votaries of the ancient worship were persecuted and put to death
on charges of witchcraft. The Albigenses, descendants of the Gnostics,
and the Waldenses, precursors of the Protestants, were hunted and massacred
under like accusations. Martin Luther himself was accused of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503">503</a></span>

companionship with Satan in proper person. The whole Protestant
world still lies under the same imputation. There is no distinction in
the judgments of the Church between dissent, heresy, and witchcraft.
And except where civil authority protects, they are alike capital offences.
Religious liberty the Church regards as intolerance.</p>

<p>But the reformers were nursed with the milk of their mother. Luther
was as bloodthirsty as the Pope; Calvin more intolerant than Leo
or Urban. Thirty years of war depopulated whole districts of Germany,
Protestants and Catholics cruel alike. The new faith too opened its
batteries against witchcraft. The statute books became crimsoned with
bloody legislation in Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Holland, Great Britain,
and the North American Commonwealth. Whosoever was more liberal,
more intelligent, more free-speaking than his fellows was liable to
arrest and death. The fires that were extinguished at Smithfield were
kindled anew for magicians; it was safer to rebel against a throne than
to pursue abstruse knowledge outside the orthodox dead-line.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century Satan made a sortie in New England,
New Jersey, New York, and several of the Southern colonies of North
America, and Cotton Mather gives us the principal chronicles of his
manifestation. A few years later he visited the Parsonage of Mora, in
Sweden, and <cite>Life in Dalecarlia</cite> was diversified with the burning alive
of young children, and the whipping of others at the church-doors on
Sabbath-days. The skepticism of modern times has, however, pretty
much driven the belief in witchcraft into Coventry; and the Devil in
personal anthropomorphic form, with his Bacchus-foot, and his Pan-like
goat’s horns, holds place only in the <cite>Encyclical Letters</cite>, and other
effusions of the Roman Catholic Church. Protestant respectability does
not allow him to be named at all except with bated breath in a pulpit-enclosure.</p>

<p>Having now set forth the biography of the Devil from his first advent
in India and Persia, his progress through Jewish, and both early and later
Christian <em>Theo</em>logy down to the latest phases of his manifestation, we now
turn back to review certain of the opinions extant in the earlier Christian
centuries.</p>

<p>Avatars or incarnations were common to the old religions. India
had them reduced to a system. The Persians expected Sosiosh, and the
Jewish writers looked for a deliverer. Tacitus and Suetonius relate that
the East was full of expectation of the Great Personage about the time
of Octavius. “Thus doctrines obvious to Christians were the highest
arcana of
 <span class="lock">Paganism.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_966" id="FNanchor_966">[966]</a></span>
 The Maneros of Plutarch was a child of
 <span class="lock">Palestine,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_967" id="FNanchor_967">[967]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">504</a></span>

his mediator Mithras, the Saviour Osiris is the Messiah. In our
present “<cite>Canonical Scriptures</cite>” are to be traced the vestigia of the
ancient worships; and in the rites and ceremonies of the Roman Catholic
Church we find the forms of the Buddhistical worship, its ceremonies and
hierarchy. The first <cite>Gospels</cite>, once as canonical as any of the present
four, contain pages taken almost entire from Buddhistical narratives, as
we are prepared to show. After the evidence furnished by Burnouf,
Asoma, Korosi, Beal, Hardy, Schmidt, and translations from the <cite>Tripitaka</cite>,
it is impossible to doubt that the whole Christian scheme emanated
from the other. The “Miraculous Conception” miracles and other incidents
are found in full in Hardy’s <cite>Manual of Buddhism</cite>. We can readily
realize why the Roman Catholic Church is anxious to keep the common
people in utter ignorance of the Hebrew <cite>Bible</cite> and the Greek literature.
Philology and comparative Theology are her deadliest enemies. The
deliberate falsifications of Irenæus, Epiphanius, Eusebius and Tertullian
had become a necessity.</p>

<p>The <cite>Sibylline Books</cite> at that period seem to have been regarded with
extraordinary favor. One can easily perceive that they were inspired
from the same source as those of the Gentile nations.</p>

<p>Here is a leaf from Gallæus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent16">“New Light has arisen:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coming from Heaven, it assumed a mortal form....</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">——Virgin, receive God in thy pure <span class="lock">bosom—</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And the Word flew into her womb:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Becoming incarnate in Time, and animated by her body,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was found in a mortal image, and a Boy was created</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By a Virgin.... The new God-sent Star was adored by the Magi,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>This looks at first-sight like a prophecy of Jesus. But could it not
mean as well some other creative God? We have like utterances concerning
Bacchus and Mithras.</p>

<p>“I, son of Deus, am come to the land of the Thebans—Bacchus, whom

<p>The <cite>Dionysiacs</cite>, written in the fifth century, serve to render this

<p>Here we have the secret of the Ophite worship, and the origin of the
Christian later-<em>revised</em> fable of the immaculate conception. The Gnostics
were the earliest Christians with anything like a regular theological
system, and it is only too evident that it was Jesus who was made to fit
their theology as Christos, and not their theology that was developed out
of his sayings and doings. Their ancestors had maintained, before the
Christian era, that the Great Serpent—Jupiter, the Dragon of Life, the
Father and “Good Divinity,” had glided into the couch of Semelé, and
now, the post-Christian Gnostics, with a very trifling change, applied the
same fable to the man Jesus, and asserted that the same “Good Divinity,”
Saturn (Ilda-Baoth), had, in the shape of the Dragon of Life, glided
over the cradle of the infant
 <span class="lock">Mary.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_973" id="FNanchor_973">[973]</a></span>
 In their eyes the Serpent was the
Logos—Christos, the incarnation of Divine Wisdom, through his Father
Ennoïa and Mother Sophia.</p>

<p>“Now my mother, the Holy Spirit (Holy Ghost) took me,” Jesus is
made to say in the <cite>Gospel of the</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Hebrews</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_974" id="FNanchor_974">[974]</a></span>
 thus entering upon his part
of Christos—the Son of Sophia, the Holy
 <span class="lock">Spirit.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_975" id="FNanchor_975">[975]</a></span></p>

<p>“The <em>Holy Ghost shall come upon thee</em>, and the <span class="smcap">Power</span> of the Highest
shall overshadow thee; therefore, that holy thing which shall be
born of thee shall be called Son of God,” says the angel (<cite>Luke</cite> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> 35).</p>

<p>“God ... hath at the last of these days spoken to us by a Son,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">506</a></span>

whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
Æons” (Paul: <abbr title="Hebrews"><cite>Heb.</cite></abbr>
 <span class="lock"><abbr title="one">i.</abbr>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_976" id="FNanchor_976">[976]</a></span></p>

<p>All such expressions are so many Christian quotations from the
<cite>Nonnus</cite> verse “... through the Ætherial Draconteum,” for Ether is
the Holy Ghost or third person of the Trinity—the Hawk-headed Serpent,
the Egyptian Kneph, emblem of the Divine
 <span class="lock">Mind,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_977" id="FNanchor_977">[977]</a></span>
 and Plato’s
universal soul.</p>

<p>“I, Wisdom, came out of the mouth of the Most High, and <em>covered
the earth as a</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>cloud</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_978" id="FNanchor_978">[978]</a></span></p>

<p>Pimander, the Logos, issues from the Infinite Darkness, and covers
the earth with clouds which, serpentine-like, spread all over the earth
(See Champollion’s <cite>Egypte</cite>). The Logos is the <em>oldest</em> image of God,
and he is the <em>active</em> Logos, says
 <span class="lock">Philo.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_979" id="FNanchor_979">[979]</a></span>
 The Father is the <em>Latent
Thought</em>.</p>

<p>This idea being universal, we find an identical phraseology to express
it, among Pagans, Jews, and early Christians. The Chaldeo-Persian
<i>Logos</i> is the Only-Begotten of the Father in the Babylonian cosmogony
of Eudemus. “Hymn now, <span class="smcap">Eli</span>, child of Deus,” begins a Homeric
hymn to the
 <span class="lock">sun.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_980" id="FNanchor_980">[980]</a></span>
 Sol-Mithra is an “image of the Father,” as the
kabalistic Seir-Anpin.</p>

<p>That of all the various nations of antiquity, there never was one
which believed in a personal devil more than liberal Christians in the
nineteenth century, seems hardly credible, and yet such is the sorrowful
fact. Neither the Egyptians, whom Porphyry terms “the most
learned nation of the
 <span class="lock">world,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_981" id="FNanchor_981">[981]</a></span>
 nor Greece, its faithful copyist, were ever
guilty of such a crowning absurdity. We may add at once that none of
them, not even the ancient Jews, believed in hell or an eternal damnation
any more than in the Devil, although our Christian churches are so
liberal in dealing it out to the heathen. Wherever the word “hell”
occurs in the translations of the Hebrew sacred texts, it is unfortunate.
The Hebrews were ignorant of such an idea; but yet the gospels contain
frequent examples of the same misunderstanding. So, when Jesus is
made to say (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="sixteen">xvi.</abbr> 18) “... and the gates of Hades shall not
prevail against it,” in the original text it stands “the gates of <em>death</em>.”

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_507">507</a></span>

Never is the word “hell”—as applied to the state of <em>damnation</em>, either
temporary or eternal—used in any passage of the <cite>Old Testament</cite>, all
hellists to the contrary, notwithstanding. “Tophet,” or “the Valley of
Hinnom” (<cite>Isaiah</cite> <abbr title="sixty-six">lxvi.</abbr> 24) bears no such interpretation. The Greek
term “Gehenna” has also quite a different meaning, as it has been
proved conclusively by more than one competent writer, that “Gehenna”
is identical with the Homeric Tartarus.</p>

<p>In fact, we have Peter himself as authority for it. In his second
<cite>Epistle</cite> (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 2) the Apostle, in the original text, is made to say of the
sinning angels that God “cast them down into <em>Tartarus</em>.” This
expression too inconveniently recalling the war of Jupiter and the Titans,
was altered, and now it reads, in King James’s version: “cast them
down to <em>hell</em>.”</p>

<p>In the <cite>Old Testament</cite> the expressions “gates of death,” and the
“chambers of death,” simply allude to the “gates of the grave,” which
are specifically mentioned in the <cite>Psalms</cite> and <cite>Proverbs</cite>. Hell and its
sovereign are both inventions of Christianity, coëval with its accession
to power and resort to tyranny. They were hallucinations born of
the nightmares of the <abbr title="Saints">SS.</abbr> Anthonys in the desert. Before our era
the ancient sages knew the “Father of Evil,” and treated him no
better than an ass, the chosen symbol of Typhon, “the
 <span class="lock">Devil.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_982" id="FNanchor_982">[982]</a></span>
 Sad
degeneration of human brains!</p>

<p>As Typhon was the dark shadow of his brother Osiris, so Python is
the evil side of Apollo, the bright god of visions, the seer and the soothsayer.
He is killed by Python, but kills him in his turn, thus redeeming
humanity from sin. It was in memory of this deed that the priestesses
of the sun-god enveloped themselves in the snake-skin, typical of the
fabulous monster. Under its exhilarating influence—the serpent’s skin
being considered magnetic—the priestesses fell into magnetic trances, and
“receiving their voice from Apollo,” they became prophetic and delivered
oracles.</p>

<p>Again Apollo and Python are one and morally androgynous. The
sun-god ideas are all dual, without exception. The beneficent warmth of
the sun calls the germ into existence, but excessive heat kills the plant.
While playing on his seven-stringed planetary lyre, Apollo produces harmony;
but, as well as other sun-gods, under his dark aspect he becomes
the destroyer, Python.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John is known to have travelled in Asia, a country governed by
Magi and imbued with Zoroastrian ideas, and in those days full of Buddhist

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_508">508</a></span>

missionaries. Had he never visited those places and come in contact
with Buddhists, it is doubtful whether the <cite>Revelation</cite> would have been
written. Besides his ideas of the dragon, he gives prophetic narratives
entirely unknown to the other apostles, and which, relating to the second
advent, make of Christ a faithful copy of Vishnu.</p>

<p>Thus Ophios and Ophiomorphos, Apollo and Python, Osiris and
Typhon, Christos and the Serpent, are all convertible terms. They are
all Logoi, and one is unintelligible without the other, as day could not
be known had we no night. All are regenerators and saviours, one in a
spiritual, the other in a physical sense. One insures immortality for the
Divine Spirit; the other gives it through regeneration of the seed. The
Saviour of mankind has to die, because he unveils to humanity the great
secret of the immortal ego; the serpent of <cite>Genesis</cite> is cursed because he
said to <em>matter</em>, “Ye shall not die.” In the world of Paganism the counterpart
of the “serpent” is the second Hermes, the reïncarnation of
Hermes Trismegistus.</p>

<p>Hermes is the constant companion and instructor of Osiris and Isis.
He is the personified wisdom; so is Cain, the son of the “Lord.” Both
build cities, civilize and instruct mankind in the arts.</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly stated by the Christian missionaries in Ceylon
and India that the people are steeped in demonolatry; that they are
devil-worshippers, in the full sense of the word. Without any exaggeration
we say that they are no more so than the masses of uneducated
Christians. But even were they worshippers of (which is more than believers
in) the Devil, yet there is a great difference between the teachings
of their clergy on the subject of a personal devil and the dogmas of
Catholic preachers and many Protestant ministers also. The Christian
priests are bound to teach and impress upon the minds of their flock the
existence of the Devil, and the opening pages of the present chapter
show the reason why. But not only will the Cingalese Oepasampala,
who belong to the highest priesthood, not confess to belief in a personal
demon but even the Samenaira, the candidates and novices, would laugh
at the idea. Everything in the external worship of the Buddhists is allegorical
and is never otherwise accepted or taught by the educated <i>pungis</i>
(pundits). The accusation that they allow, and tacitly agree to leave
the poor people steeped in the most degrading superstitions, is not without
foundation; but that they enforce such superstitions, we most vehemently
deny. And in this they appear to advantage beside our Christian
clergy, who (at least those who have not allowed their fanaticism to
interfere with their brains), without believing a word of it, yet preach the
existence of the Devil, as the personal enemy of a personal God, and the
evil genius of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_509">509</a></span>

<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George’s Dragon, which figures so promiscuously in the grandest
cathedrals of the Christians, is not a whit handsomer than the King of
Snakes, the Buddhist Nammadānam-nāraya, the great Dragon. If the
planetary Demon Rawho, is believed, in the popular superstition of the
Cingalese, to endeavor to destroy the moon by swallowing it; and if in
China and Tartary the rabble is allowed, without rebuke, to beat gongs
and make fearful noises to drive the monster away from its prey during
the eclipses, why should the Catholic clergy find fault, or call this superstition?
Do not the country clergy in Southern France do the same,
occasionally, at the appearance of comets, eclipses, and other celestial
phenomena? In 1456, when Halley’s comet made its appearance, “so
tremendous was its apparition,” writes Draper, “that it was necessary
for the Pope himself to interfere. He exorcised and expelled it from the
skies. It slunk away into the abysses of space, terror-stricken by the
maledictions of Calixtus <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr>, and did not venture back for seventy-five
<span class="lock">years!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_983" id="FNanchor_983">[983]</a></span></p>

<p>We never heard of any Christian clergyman or Pope trying to disabuse
ignorant minds of the belief that the Devil had anything to do
with eclipses and comets; but we do find a Buddhist chief priest saying to
an official who twitted him with this superstition: “Our Cingalese religious
books teach that the eclipses of the sun and moon denote an attack
of <span class="lock">Rahu<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_984" id="FNanchor_984">[984]</a></span>
 (one of the nine planets) <em>not by a</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>devil</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_985" id="FNanchor_985">[985]</a></span></p>

<p>The origin of the “Dragon” myth so prominent in the <cite>Apocalypse</cite>
and <cite>Golden Legend</cite>, and of the fable about Simeon Stylites converting
the Dragon, is undeniably Buddhistic and even pre-Buddhistic. It was
Gautama’s pure doctrines which reclaimed to Buddhism the Cashmerians
whose primitive worship was the Ophite or Serpent worship. Frankincense
and flowers replaced the human sacrifices and belief in personal
demons. It became the turn of Christianity to inherit the degrading
superstition about devils invested with pestilential and murderous powers.
The <cite>Mahâvansa</cite>, oldest of the Ceylonese books, relates the story of King
Covercapal (cobra-de-capello), the snake-god, who was converted to
Buddhism by a holy
 <span class="lock">Rahat;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_986" id="FNanchor_986">[986]</a></span>
 and it is earlier, by all odds, than the <cite>Golden
Legend</cite> which tells the same of Simeon the Stylite and his Dragon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_510">510</a></span>

The Logos triumphs once more over the great Dragon; Michael, the
luminous archangel, chief of the Æons, conquers
 <span class="lock">Satan.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_987" id="FNanchor_987">[987]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a fact worthy of remark, that so long as the initiate kept silent
“on what he knew,” he was perfectly safe. So was it in days of old,
and so it is now. As soon as the Christian God, emanating forth from
<em>Silence</em>, manifested himself as the <i>Word</i> or Logos, the latter became the
cause of his death. The serpent is the symbol of wisdom and eloquence,
but it is likewise the symbol of destruction. “To dare, to know, to will,
<em>and be silent</em>,” are the cardinal axioms of the kabalist. Like Apollo and
other gods, Jesus is killed by his
 <span class="lock"><i>Logos</i>;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_988" id="FNanchor_988">[988]</a></span>
 he rises again, kills him in
his turn, and becomes his master. Can it be that this old symbol has,
like the rest of ancient philosophical conceptions, more than one allegorical
and never-suspected meaning? The coincidences are too strange
to be results of mere chance.</p>

<p>And now that we have shown this identity between Michael and
Satan, and the Saviours and Dragons of other people, what can be more
clear than that all these philosophical fables originated in India, that universal
hot-bed of metaphysical mysticism? “The world,” says Ramatsariar,
in his comments upon the <cite>Vedas</cite>, “commenced with a contest between
the Spirit of Good and the Spirit of Evil, and so must end. After the
destruction of matter evil can no longer exist, it must return to
 <span class="lock">naught.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_989" id="FNanchor_989">[989]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <cite>Apologia</cite>, Tertullian falsifies most palpably every doctrine and
belief of the Pagans as to the oracles and gods. He calls them, indifferently,
demons and devils, accusing the latter of taking possession of even
the birds of the air! What Christian would now dare doubt such an
authority? Did not the Psalmist exclaim: “All the gods of the
nations are <em>idols</em>;” and the Angel of the School, Thomas Aquinas,
explains, on his own <em>kabalistic</em> authority, the word <i>idols</i> by <i>devils</i>?
“They come to men,” he says, “and offer themselves to their adoration
by operating certain things which seem
 <span class="lock">miraculous.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_990" id="FNanchor_990">[990]</a></span></p>

<p>The Fathers were prudent as they were wise in their inventions. To
be impartial, after having created a Devil, they set to creating apocryphal
saints. We have named several in preceding chapters; but we must
not forget Baronius, who having read in a work of Chrysostom about
the holy <i>Xenoris</i>, the word meaning a <i>pair</i>, a couple, mistook it for the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_511">511</a></span>

name of a saint, and proceeded forthwith to create of it a <em>martyr</em> of
Antioch, and went on to give a most detailed and authentic biography of
the “blessed martyr.” Other theologians made of Apollyon—or rather
<i>Apolouôn</i>—the anti-Christ. Apolouôn is Plato’s “washer,” the god <i>who
purifies</i>, who washes off, and <i>releases</i> us from sin, but he was thus transformed
into him “whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but
in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon”—Devil!</p>

<p>Max Müller says that the serpent in Paradise is a conception which
might have sprung up among the Jews, and “seems hardly to invite
comparison with the much grander conceptions of the terrible power of
Vritra and Ahriman in the <cite>Veda</cite> and <cite>Avesta</cite>.” With the kabalists the
Devil was always a myth—God or good reversed. That modern Magus,
Eliphas Levi, calls the Devil <i lang="fr">l’ivresse astrale</i>. It is a blind force like
electricity, he says; and, speaking allegorically, as he always did, Jesus
remarked that he “beheld Satan like lightning fall from Heaven.”</p>

<p>The clergy insist that God has sent the Devil to tempt mankind;
which would be rather a singular way of showing his boundless love to
humanity! If the Supreme One is really guilty of such unfatherly
treachery, he is worthy, certainly, of the adoration only of a Church capable
of singing the <i lang="la">Te Deum</i> over a massacre of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Bartholomew, and of
blessing Mussulman swords drawn to slaughter Greek Christians!</p>

<p>This is at once sound logic and good sound law, for is it not a
maxim of jurisprudence: “<i lang="la">Qui facit per alium, facit per se?</i>”</p>

<p>The great dissimilarity which exists between the various conceptions
of the Devil is really often ludicrous. While bigots will invariably
endow him with horns, tail, and every conceivable repulsive feature,
even including an offensive <em>human</em>
 <span class="lock">smell,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_991" id="FNanchor_991">[991]</a></span>
 Milton, Byron, Goethe,
 <span class="lock">Lermontoff,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_992" id="FNanchor_992">[992]</a></span>
 and a host of French novelists have sung his praise in
flowing verse and thrilling prose. Milton’s Satan, and even Goethe’s
Mephistopheles, are certainly far more commanding figures than some
of the angels, as represented in the prose of ecstatic bigots. We have

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_512">512</a></span>

but to compare two descriptions. Let us first award the floor to the
incomparably sensational des Mousseaux. He gives us a thrilling account
of an incubus, in the words of the penitent herself: “Once,”
she tells us, “during the space of a whole half-hour, she saw <em>distinctly</em>
near her an individual with a black, dreadful, horrid body, and whose
hands, of an enormous size, exhibited <em>clawed</em> fingers strangely hooked.
The senses of sight, feeling, and <em>smell</em> were confirmed by that of
<span class="lock">hearing!!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_993" id="FNanchor_993">[993]</a></span></p>

<p>And yet, for the space of several years, the damsel suffered herself
to be led astray by such a hero! How far above this odoriferous gallant
is the majestic figure of the Miltonic Satan!</p>

<p>Let the reader then fancy, if he can, this superb chimera, this ideal
of the rebellious angel become incarnate Pride, crawling into the skin of
the most disgusting of all animals! Notwithstanding that the Christian
catechism teaches us that Satan in <i lang="la">propria persona</i> tempted our first
mother, Eve, in a real paradise, and that in the shape of a serpent, which
of all animals was the most insinuating and fascinating! God orders him,
as a punishment, to crawl eternally on his belly, and bite the dust. “A
sentence,” remarks Levi, “which resembles in nothing the traditional
flames of hell.” The more so, that the real zoölogical serpent, which was
created before Adam and Eve, crawled on his belly, and bit the dust likewise,
before there was any original sin.</p>

<p>Apart from this, was not Ophion the Daimon, or Devil, like God called
 <span class="lock"><i>Dominus</i>?<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_994" id="FNanchor_994">[994]</a></span>
 The word <i>God</i> (deity) is derived from the Sanscrit word
<i>Deva</i>, and Devil from the Persian <i>daëva</i>, which words are substantially
alike. Hercules, son of Jove and Alcmena, one of the highest sun-gods
and also Logos manifested, is nevertheless represented under a double
nature, as all
 <span class="lock">others.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_995" id="FNanchor_995">[995]</a></span></p>

<p>The Agathodæmon, the beneficent
 <span class="lock">dæmon,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_996" id="FNanchor_996">[996]</a></span>
 the same which we find
later among the Ophites under the appellation of the Logos, or divine
wisdom, was represented by a serpent standing erect on a <em>pole</em>, in the
Bacchanalian Mysteries. The hawk-headed serpent is among the oldest
of the Egyptian emblems, and represents the divine mind, says
 <span class="lock">Deane.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_997" id="FNanchor_997">[997]</a></span></p>

<p>Azazel is Moloch and Samael, says
 <span class="lock">Movers,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_998" id="FNanchor_998">[998]</a></span>
 and we find Aaron, the
brother of the great law-giver Moses, making equal sacrifices to Jehovah
and Azazel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_513">513</a></span>

“And Aaron shall cast lots <em>upon the two goats</em>; one lot for the Lord
(<i>Ihoh</i> in the original) and one lot for the scape-goat” (<i>Azazel</i>).</p>

<p>In the <cite>Old Testament</cite> Jehovah exhibits all the attributes of old
 <span class="lock">Saturn,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_999" id="FNanchor_999">[999]</a></span>
notwithstanding his metamorphoses from Adoni into Eloi, and God of
Gods, Lord of
 <span class="lock">Lords.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1000" id="FNanchor_1000">[1000]</a></span></p>

<p>Jesus is tempted on the mountain by the Devil, who promises to him
kingdoms and glory if he will only fall down and worship him (<cite>Matthew</cite>
<abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 8, 9). Buddha is tempted by the Demon Wasawarthi Mara, who says
to him as he is leaving his father’s palace: “Be entreated to stay that
you may possess the honors that are within your reach; go not, go not!”
And upon the refusal of Gautama to accept his offers, gnashes his teeth
with rage, and threatens him with vengeance. Like Christ, Buddha
triumphs over the
 <span class="lock">Devil.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1001" id="FNanchor_1001">[1001]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Bacchic Mysteries a <em>consecrated cup</em> was handed around after
supper, called the cup of the
 <span class="lock">Agathodæmon.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1002" id="FNanchor_1002">[1002]</a></span>
 The Ophite rite of the
same description is evidently borrowed from these Mysteries. The communion
consisting of bread and wine was used in the worship of nearly
every important
 <span class="lock">deity.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1003" id="FNanchor_1003">[1003]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with the semi-Mithraic sacrament adopted by the Marcosians,
another Gnostic sect, utterly kabalistic and <em>theurgic</em>, there is a
strange story given by Epiphanius as an illustration of the cleverness of
the Devil. In the celebration of their Eucharist, three large vases of the
finest and clearest crystal were brought among the congregation and filled
with white wine. While the ceremony was going on, in full view of
everybody, this wine was instantaneously changed into a blood-red, a
purple, and then into an azure-blue color. “Then the magus,” says
Epiphanius, “hands one of these vases to a woman in the congregation,
and asks her to bless it. When it is done, the magus pours out of it into
another vase of much greater capacity with the prayer: “May the grace
of God, which is above all, inconceivable, inexplicable, fill thy inner man,
and augment the knowledge of Him within thee, sowing the grain of mustard-seed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_514">514</a></span>

in good
 <span class="lock">ground.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1004" id="FNanchor_1004">[1004]</a></span>
 Whereupon the liquor in the larger vase swells

<p>In connection with several of the Pagan deities which are made after
death, and before their resurrection to descend into Hell, it will be found
useful to compare the pre-Christian with the post-Christian narratives.
Orpheus made the
 <span class="lock">journey,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1006" id="FNanchor_1006">[1006]</a></span>
 and Christ was the last of these subterranean
travellers. In the <cite>Credo</cite> of the Apostles, which is divided in twelve sentences
or <i>articles</i>, each particular article having been inserted by each
particular apostle, according to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
 <span class="lock">Austin<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1007" id="FNanchor_1007">[1007]</a></span>
 the sentence “He descended
into hell, the third day he rose again from the dead,” is assigned to
Thomas; perhaps, as an atonement for his unbelief. Be it as it may,
the sentence is declared a forgery, and there is no evidence “that this
creed was either framed by the apostles, or indeed, that it existed as a
creed in their
 <span class="lock">time.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1008" id="FNanchor_1008">[1008]</a></span></p>

<p>It is the most important addition in the Apostle’s Creed, and dates
since the year of Christ
 <span class="lock">600.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1009" id="FNanchor_1009">[1009]</a></span>
 It was not known in the days of Eusebius.
Bishop Parsons says that it was not in the ancient creeds or rules
of
 <span class="lock">faith.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1010" id="FNanchor_1010">[1010]</a></span>
 Irenæus, Origen, and Tertullian exhibit no knowledge of
this
 <span class="lock">sentence.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1011" id="FNanchor_1011">[1011]</a></span>
 It is not mentioned in any of the Councils before the
seventh century. Theodoret, Epiphanius, and Socrates are silent about
it. It differs from the <em>creed</em> in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
 <span class="lock">Augustine.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1012" id="FNanchor_1012">[1012]</a></span>
 Ruffinus affirms that in
his time it was neither in the Roman nor in the Oriental creeds
(<abbr title="Expositio in symbolum apostolorum, Section"><cite>Exposit. in Symbol. Apost.</cite> §</abbr> 10). But the problem is solved when we
learn that ages ago Hermes spoke thus to Prometheus, chained on the
arid rocks of the Caucasian mount:</p>

<p>“To such labors look thou for no termination, <span class="allsmcap">UNTIL SOME GOD</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_515">515</a></span>

<span class="smcap">shall appear as a substitute in thy pangs, and shall be willing
to go both to gloomy Hades and to the murky depths around
Tartarus</span>!” (<span class="smcap">Æschylus</span>: <cite>Prometheus</cite>, 1027, ff.).</p>

<p>This god was Herakles, the “Only-Begotten One,” and the Saviour.
And it is he who was chosen as a model by the ingenious Fathers. Hercules—called
Alexicacos—for he brought round the wicked and converted
them to virtue; <i>Soter</i>, or Saviour, also called Neulos Eumelos—the
<i>Good Shepherd</i>; Astrochiton, the star-clothed, and the Lord of
Fire. “He sought not to subject nations by force but by <em>divine wisdom</em>
and persuasion,” says Lucian. “Herakles spread cultivation and a mild
religion, and destroyed the <em>doctrine of eternal punishment</em> by dragging
Kerberus (the Pagan Devil) from the nether world.” And, as we see, it
was Herakles again who liberated Prometheus (the Adam of the pagans),
by putting an end to the torture inflicted on him for his transgressions,
by descending to the Hades, and going round the Tartarus. Like Christ
he appeared as a <em>substitute for the pangs of humanity</em>, by offering himself
in a self-sacrifice on a funereal-burning pile. “His voluntary immolation,”
says Bart, “betokened the ethereal new birth of men....
Through the release of Prometheus, and the erection of altars, we
behold in him the mediator between the old and new faiths.... He abolished
human sacrifice wherever he found it practiced. He descended
into the sombre realm of Pluto, as a shade ... he <em>ascended as a spirit
to his father Zeus in Olympus</em>.”</p>

<p>So much was antiquity impressed by the Heraklean legend, that even
the <em>monotheistic</em> (?) Jews of those days, not to be outdone by their contemporaries,
put him to use in their manufacture of original fables.
Herakles is accused in his mythobiography of an attempted theft of the
Delphian oracle. In <cite>Sepher Toldos Jeschu</cite>, the Rabbins accuse Jesus of
stealing from their Sanctuary the Incommunicable Name!</p>

<p>Therefore it is but natural to find his numerous adventures, worldly
and religious, mirrored so faithfully in the <cite>Descent into Hell</cite>. For
extraordinary daring of mendacity, and unblushing plagiarism, the <cite>Gospel
of Nicodemus</cite>, only <em>now</em> proclaimed apocryphal, surpasses anything
we have read. Let the reader judge.</p>

<p>At the beginning of chapter <abbr title="sixteen">xvi.</abbr>, Satan and the “Prince of Hell”
are described as peacefully conversing together. All of a sudden, both
are startled by “a voice as of thunder” and the rushing of winds,
which bids them to lift up their gates for “<em>the King of Glory</em> shall come
in.” Whereupon the Prince of Hell hearing this “begins quarrelling
with Satan for minding his duty so poorly, as not to have taken the
necessary precautions against such a visit.” The quarrel ends with the
prince casting Satan “forth from his hell,” ordering, at the same time,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_516">516</a></span>

his impious officers “to shut the brass gates of cruelty, make them fast
with iron bars, and fight courageously lest we be taken captives.”</p>

<p>But “when all the company of the saints ... (in Hell?) heard
this, they spoke with a loud voice of anger to the Prince of Darkness,
‘Open thy gates, that the King of Glory may come in,’” thereby proving
that the prince needed spokesmen.</p>

<p>“And the <em>divine</em> (?) prophet David cried out, saying: ‘Did not I,
when on earth, truly prophesy?’” After this, another prophet, namely
holy Isaiah spake in like manner, “Did not I rightly prophesy?” etc.
Then the company of the saints and prophets, after boasting for the
length of a chapter, and comparing notes of their prophecies, begin a
riot, which makes the Prince of Hell remark that, “the dead never
durst before behave themselves so insolently towards us” (the devils,
<abbr title="eighteen">xviii.</abbr> 6); feigning the while to be ignorant <em>who</em> it was claiming admission.
He then innocently asks again: “But who is the King of
Glory?” Then David tells him that he knows the voice well, and
understands its words, “because,” he adds, “I spake them by his
Spirit.” Perceiving finally that the Prince of Hell would not open the
“brass doors of iniquity,” notwithstanding the king-psalmist’s voucher
for the visitor, he, David, concludes to treat the enemy “as a Philistine,
and begins shouting: ‘And now, thou <em>filthy</em> and <em>stinking</em> prince of
hell, open thy gates.... I tell thee that the King of Glory comes ...
let him enter in.’”</p>

<p>While he was yet quarrelling the “mighty Lord appeared in the
form of a <em>man</em>” (?) upon which “impious <em>Death</em> and her cruel officers
are seized with fear.” Then they tremblingly begin to address Christ
with various flatteries and compliments in the shape of questions, each
of which <em>is an article of creed</em>. For instance: “And who art thou,
so powerful and so great who dost release the captives that were <em>held in
chains by original sin</em>?” asks one devil. “Perhaps, thou art that
Jesus,” submissively says another, “of whom Satan just now spoke, that
by the <em>death of the Cross thou wert about to receive the power over
death</em>?” etc. Instead of answering, the King of Glory “tramples upon
Death, seizes the Prince of Hell, and deprives him of his power.”</p>

<p>Then begins a turmoil in Hell which has been graphically described
by Homer, Hesiod, and their interpreter Preller, in his account of the
Astronomical Hercules <i lang="la">Invictus</i>, and his festivals at Tyre, Tarsus, and
Sardis. Having been initiated in the Attic Eleusinia, the Pagan god
descends into Hades and “when he entered the nether world he spread
such terror among the dead that all of them
 <span class="lock">fled!”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1013" id="FNanchor_1013">[1013]</a></span>
 The same words

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_517">517</a></span>

are repeated in <cite>Nicodemus</cite>. Follows a scene of confusion, horror, and
lamenting. Perceiving that the battle is lost, the Prince of Hell turns
tail and prudently chooses to side with the strongest. He against whom,
according to Jude and Peter, even the Archangel Michael “durst not
bring a railing accusation before the Lord,” is now shamefully treated by
his ex-ally and friend, the “Prince of Hell.” Poor Satan is abused and
reviled for all his crimes both by devils and saints; while the <em>Prince</em>
is openly rewarded for his treachery. Addressing him, the King of
Glory says thus: “Beelzebub, the Prince of Hell, Satan the Prince
shall now be subject to thy dominion <em>forever, in the room of Adam</em> and
his righteous sons, who are mine ... Come to me, all ye my saints,
who were <em>created in my image</em>, who <em>were condemned by the tree of the
forbidden fruit</em>, and <em>by the Devil and death</em>. Live now <em>by the wood of
my cross</em>; the Devil, the prince of this world is overcome (?) and <em>Death
is conquered</em>.” Then the Lord takes hold of Adam by his right hand,
of David by the left, and “<em>ascends</em> from Hell, followed by all the
saints,” Enoch and Elias, and by the “<em>holy</em>
 <span class="lock">thief.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1014" id="FNanchor_1014">[1014]</a></span></p>

<p>The pious author, perhaps through an oversight, omits to complete
the cavalcade, by bringing up the rear with the penitent dragon of Simon
Stylites and the converted wolf of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis, wagging their tails and
shedding tears of joy!</p>

<p>In the <cite>Codex</cite> of the Nazarenes it is <i>Tobo</i> who is “the <em>liberator of the
soul of Adam</em>,” to bear it from Orcus (Hades) to the place of <span class="smcap">Life</span>.
Tobo is Tob-Adonijah, one of the twelve disciples (Levites) sent by
Jehosaphat to preach to the cities of Judah the <cite>Book of the Law</cite> (<cite>2 <abbr title="Chronicles">Chron.</abbr></cite>
<abbr title="seventeen">xvii.</abbr>). In the kabalistic books these were “wise men,” Magi. They
drew down the rays of the sun to enlighten the sheol (Hades) Orcus, and
thus show the way out of the <i lang="la">Tenebræ</i>, the darkness of ignorance, to the
soul of Adam, which represents collectively all the “souls of mankind.”
Adam (Athamas) is Tamuz or Adonis, and Adonis is the sun Helios. In
the <cite>Book of the Dead</cite> (<abbr title="six">vi.</abbr> 231) Osiris is made to say: “I shine like the
sun in the star-house at the feast of the sun.” Christ is called the “Sun
of Righteousness,” “Helios of Justice” (<abbr title="Eusebius: Demonstratio evangelica, five">Euseb.: <cite>Demons. Ev.</cite>, v.</abbr> 29), simply
a revamping of the old heathen allegories; nevertheless, to have
made it serve for such a use is no less blasphemous on the part of men
who pretended to be describing a true episode of the earth-pilgrimage of
their God!</p>

<p>But the Christians accept these <i lang="la">post-mortem</i> adventures of their god,
concocted from those of his Pagan predecessors, and derided by Aristophanes
four centuries before our era, <em>literally</em>! The absurdities of <cite>Nicodemus</cite>
were read in the churches, as well as those of the <cite>Shepherd of
Hermas</cite>. Irenæus quotes the latter under the name of <em>Scripture</em>, a
divinely-inspired “revelation;” Jerome and Eusebius both insist upon
its being publicly read in the churches; and Athanasius observes that
the Fathers “appointed it to be read in <em>confirmation of faith and piety</em>.”
But then comes the reverse of this bright medal, to show once more how
stable and trustworthy were the opinions of the strongest pillars of an
<em>infallible</em> Church. Jerome, who applauds the book in his catalogue of
ecclesiastical writers, in his later comments terms it “apocryphal and
foolish!” Tertullian, who could not find praise enough for the <cite>Shepherd
of Hermas</cite> when a Catholic, “began abusing it when a
 <span class="lock">Montanist.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1020" id="FNanchor_1020">[1020]</a></span></p>

<p>Chapter <abbr title="thirteen">xiii.</abbr> begins with the narrative given by the two resuscitated
ghosts of Charinus and Lenthius, the sons of that Simeon who, in the
<cite>Gospel according to Luke</cite> (<abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 25-32), takes the infant Jesus in his arms
and blesses God, saying: “Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in
peace ... for mine eyes have seen thy
 <span class="lock">salvation.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1021" id="FNanchor_1021">[1021]</a></span>
 These two ghosts

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_519">519</a></span>

have arisen from their cold tombs on purpose to declare “the mysteries”
which they saw after death in hell. They are enabled to do so only at
the importunate prayer of Annas and Caïaphas, Nicodemus (the author),
Joseph (of Arimathæa), and Gamaliel, who beseech them to reveal to them
the great secrets. Annas and Caïaphas, however, who bring the <em>ghosts</em> to
the synagogue at Jerusalem, take the precaution to make the two resuscitated
men, who had been dead and buried for years, to swear on the
<cite>Book of the Law</cite> “by God Adonai, and the God of Israel,” to tell them
only the truth. Therefore, after making the <em>sign of the cross</em> on their
 <span class="lock">tongues,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1022" id="FNanchor_1022">[1022]</a></span>
 they ask for some paper to write their confessions (<abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 21-25).
They state how, when “in the depth of hell, in the blackness of darkness,”
they suddenly saw “a substantial, purple-colored light illuminating the
place.” Adam, with the patriarchs and prophets, began thereupon to rejoice,
and Isaiah also immediately boasted that he had <em>predicted all that</em>.
While this was going on, Simeon, their father, arrived, declaring that
“the infant he took in his arms in the temple was now coming to liberate
them.”</p>

<p>After Simeon had delivered his message to the distinguished company
in hell, “there came forth one like a little hermit (?), who proved to be
John the Baptist.” The idea is suggestive and shows that even the
“Precursor” and “the Prophet of the Most High,” had not been exempted
from drying up in hell to the most diminutive proportions, and
that to the extent of affecting his brains and memory. Forgetting that
(<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>) he had manifested the most evident doubts as to the Messiahship
of Jesus, the Baptist also claims his right to be recognized as a
prophet. “And I, John,” he says, “when I saw Jesus coming to me,
being moved by the Holy Ghost, I said: ‘Behold the Lamb of God,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_520">520</a></span>

who takes away the sins of the world’ ... And I baptized him ... and
I saw the Holy Ghost descending upon him, and saying, ‘This is my Beloved
Son,’ etc.” And to think, that his descendants and followers, like
the Mandeans of Basra, utterly reject these words!</p>

<p>Then Adam, who acts as though his own veracity might be questioned
in this “impious company,” calls his son Seth, and desires him to declare
to his sons, the patriarchs and prophets, what the Archangel
Michael had told him at the gate of Paradise, when he, Adam, sent Seth
“to entreat God that he would anoint” his head when Adam was sick
(<abbr title="fourteen">xiv.</abbr> 2). And Seth tells them that when he was praying at the gates of
Paradise, Michael advised him not to entreat God for “the oil of the
tree of mercy wherewith to anoint father Adam for his <em>headache</em>; because
thou canst not by any means obtain it till the <span class="allsmcap">LAST DAY</span> and times, namely
<em>till 5,500 years be past</em>.”</p>

<p>This little bit of private gossip between Michael and Seth was evidently
introduced in the interests of Patristic Chronology; and for the
purpose of connecting Messiahship still closer with Jesus, on the authority
of a recognized and divinely-inspired Gospel. The Fathers of the
early centuries committed an inextricable mistake in destroying fragile
images and mortal Pagans, in preference to the monuments of Egyptian
antiquity. These have become the more precious to archæology and
modern science since it is found they prove that King Menes and his
architects flourished between four and five thousand years before
“Father Adam” and the universe, according to the biblical chronology,
were created “out of
 <span class="lock">nothing.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1023" id="FNanchor_1023">[1023]</a></span></p>

<p>“While all the saints were rejoicing, behold Satan, the prince and
captain of death,” says to the Prince of Hell: “Prepare to receive Jesus
of Nazareth himself, who boasted that he was the Son of God, and yet
was a man afraid of death, and said: ‘My soul is sorrowful even to
death’” (<abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 1, 2).</p>

<p>There is a tradition among the Greek ecclesiastical writers that the
“Hæretics” (perhaps Celsus) had sorely twitted the Christians on this
delicate point. They held that if Jesus were not a simple mortal, who
was often forsaken by the Spirit of Christos, he could not have complained
in such expressions as are attributed to him; neither would he have
cried out with a loud voice: “My <em>god</em>, My <em>god</em>! why hast thou forsaken

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_521">521</a></span>

me?” This objection is very cleverly answered in the <cite>Gospel of
Nicodemus</cite>, and it is the “Prince of Hell” who settles the difficulty.</p>

<p>He begins by arguing with Satan like a true metaphysician. “Who is
that so powerful prince,” he sneeringly inquires, “who is he so powerful,
and yet a man who is afraid of death?... I affirm to thee that
when, therefore, he said he was afraid of death, <em>he designed to ensnare thee</em>,
and unhappy it will be to thee for everlasting ages!”</p>

<p>It is quite refreshing to see how closely the author of this <cite>Gospel</cite>
sticks to his <cite>New Testament</cite> text, and especially to the fourth evangelist.
How cleverly he prepares the way for seemingly “innocent” questions
and answers, corroborating the most dubious passages of the four gospels,
passages more questioned and cross-examined in those days of subtile
sophistry of the learned Gnostics than they are now; a weighty reason
why the Fathers should have been even more anxious to burn the documents
of their antagonists than to destroy their heresy. The following
is a good instance. The dialogue is still proceeding between Satan and
the metaphysical <em>half-converted</em> Prince of the under world.</p>

<p>“Who, then, is that Jesus of Nazareth,” naïvely inquires the prince,
“that by his word hath taken away the dead from me, without prayers to
God?” (<abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 16).</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replies Satan, with the innocence of a Jesuit, “<em>it is the same
who took away from me</em> <span class="smcap">Lazarus</span>, <em>after he had been four days dead</em>, and
did both stink and was rotten?... It is the very same person,
Jesus of Nazareth.... I adjure thee, by the powers which belong to
thee and me, that thou bring him not to me!” exclaims the prince.
“For when I heard of the power of his word, I trembled for fear, and all
my <em>impious</em> company were disturbed. And we were not able to detain
Lazarus, but he gave himself <em>a shake</em>, and <em>with all the signs of malice</em>, he
immediately went away from us; and the very earth, in which the dead
body of Lazarus was lodged, presently turned him alive.” “Yes,” thoughtfully
adds the Prince of Hell, “I know now <em>that he is Almighty God</em>, who
is mighty in his dominion, and mighty <em>in his human nature</em>, who is the
Saviour of mankind. Bring not therefore this person hither, for he will
set at liberty all those I held in prison under unbelief, and ... <em>will
conduct them to everlasting life</em>” (<abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 20).</p>

<p>Here ends the <i lang="la">post-mortem</i> evidence of the two ghosts. Charinus
(ghost <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 1) gives what he wrote to Annas, Caïaphas, and Gamaliel, and
Lenthius (ghost <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2) his to Joseph and Nicodemus, having done which,
both change into “exceedingly white forms and were seen no more.”</p>

<p>To show furthermore that the “ghosts” had been all the time under
the strictest “test conditions,” as the modern spiritualists would express
it, the author of the <cite>Gospel</cite> adds: “But what they had wrote was <em>found</em>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_522">522</a></span>

<em>perfectly to agree</em>, the one not containing one letter more or less than the
other.”</p>

<p>This news spread in all the synagogues, the Gospel goes on to state,
that Pilate went to the temple as advised by Nicodemus, and assembled
the Jews together. At this historical interview, Caïaphas and Annas are
made to declare that their Scriptures testify “<cite>that He (Jesus) is the Son
of God and the Lord and King of Israel</cite>” (!) and close the confession
with the following memorable words:</p>

<p>“And so it appears <em>that Jesus, whom we crucified, is Jesus Christ, the
Son of God, and true and Almighty God</em>. Amen.” (!)</p>

<p>Notwithstanding such a crushing confession for themselves, and the
recognition of Jesus as the Almighty God himself, the “Lord God of
Israel,” neither the high priest, nor his father-in-law, nor any of the elders,
nor Pilate, who wrote those accounts, nor any of the Jews of Jerusalem,
who were at all prominent, became Christians.</p>

<p>Comments are unnecessary. This <cite>Gospel</cite> closes with the words: “In
the name of <em>the Holy Trinity</em> [of which Nicodemus could know nothing
yet] <em>thus ends the Acts of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which the emperor Theodosius
the Great found at Jerusalem, in the hall of Pontius Pilate among
the public records</em>;” and which history purports to have been written in
Hebrew by Nicodemus, “<em>the things being acted in the nineteenth year of
Tiberius Cæsar, emperor of the Romans, and in the seventeenth year of the
government of Herod, the son of Herod, king of Galilee, on the eighth before
the calends of April</em>, etc., etc.” It is the most barefaced imposture that
was perpetrated after the era of pious forgeries opened with the first bishop
of Rome, whoever he may have been. The clumsy forger seems to have
neither known nor heard that the dogma of the Trinity was not propounded
until 325 years later than this pretended date. Neither the <cite>Old</cite>
nor the <cite>New Testament</cite> contains the word Trinity, nor anything that
affords the slightest pretext for this doctrine (see <a href="#Page_177" class="pginternal">page 177</a> of this volume,
“Christ’s descent into Hell”). No explanation can palliate the putting
forth of this spurious gospel as a divine revelation, for it was known from
the first as a premeditated imposture. If the gospel itself has been declared
apocryphal, nevertheless every one of the dogmas contained in it
was and is still enforced upon the Christian world. And even the fact
that itself is now repudiated, is no merit, <em>for the Church was shamed and
forced into it</em>.</p>

<p>And so we are perfectly warranted in repeating the amended <cite>Credo</cite> of
Robert Taylor, which is substantially that of the Christians.</p>

<p>The Israelites have been proved to have worshipped Baal, the Syrian
Bacchus, offered incense to the Sabazian or Æsculapian serpent, and performed
the Dionysian Mysteries. And how could it be otherwise if
Typhon was called Typhon
 <span class="lock">Set,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1024" id="FNanchor_1024">[1024]</a></span>
 and Seth, the son of Adam, is identical
with Satan or Sat-an; and Seth was worshipped by the Hittites? Less
than two centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, we find the Jews either reverencing or simply
worshipping the “golden head of an ass” in their temple; according to
Apion, Antiochus Epiphanes carried it off with him. And Zacharias is
struck dumb by the apparition of the deity under the shape of an ass in
the <span class="lock">temple!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1025" id="FNanchor_1025">[1025]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_524"></a></span>

El, the Sun-God of the Syrians, the Egyptians, and the Semites, is declared
by Pleytè to be no other than Set or Seth, and El is the primeval
 <span class="lock">Saturn—Israel.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1026" id="FNanchor_1026">[1026]</a></span>
 Siva is an Æthiopian God, the same as the Chaldean
<span class="lock">Baal—Bel;</span> thus he is also Saturn. Saturn, El, Seth and Kiyun, or the
biblical Chiun of Amos, are all one and the same deity, and may be all
regarded in their worst aspect as Typhon the Destroyer. When the religious
Pantheon assumed a more definite expression, Typhon was separated
from his androgyne—the <em>good</em> deity, and fell into degradation as a brutal
<em>unintellectual</em> power.</p>

<p>Such reactions in the religious feelings of a nation were not unfrequent.
The Jews had worshipped Baal or Moloch, the Sun-God
 <span class="lock">Hercules,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1027" id="FNanchor_1027">[1027]</a></span>
 in
their early days—if they had any days at all earlier than the Persians or
Maccabees—and then made their prophets denounce them. On the other
hand, the characteristics of the Mosaic Jehovah exhibit more of the moral
disposition of Siva than of a benevolent, “long-suffering” God. Besides,
to be identified with Siva is no small compliment, for the latter is God of
wisdom. Wilkinson depicts him as the most intellectual of the Hindu gods.
He is <em>three-eyed</em>, and, like Jehovah, terrible in his resistless revenge and
wrath. And, although the Destroyer, “yet he is the re-creator of all
things in perfect
 <span class="lock">wisdom.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1028" id="FNanchor_1028">[1028]</a></span>
 He is the type of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Augustine’s God who
“prepares <em>hell</em> for pryers into his mysteries,” and insists on trying human
reason as well as common sense by forcing mankind to view with equal
reverence his good and evil acts.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the numerous proofs that the Israelites worshipped
a variety of gods, and even offered human sacrifices until a far later
period than their Pagan neighbors, they have contrived to blind posterity
in regard to truth. They sacrificed human life as late as 169
 <span class="lock"><span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1029" id="FNanchor_1029">[1029]</a></span>
 and
the <cite>Bible</cite> contains a number of such records. At a time when the Pagans
had long abandoned the abominable practice, and had replaced the sacrificial
man by the
 <span class="lock">animal,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1030" id="FNanchor_1030">[1030]</a></span>
 Jephthah is represented sacrificing his own
daughter to the “Lord” for a burnt-offering.</p>

<p>The denunciations of their own prophets are the best proofs against
them. Their worship in high places is the same as that of the “idolaters.”
Their prophetesses are counterparts of the Pythiæ and Bacchantes.
Pausanias speaks of women-colleges which superintend the worship of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_525">525</a></span>

Bacchus, and of the sixteen matrons of
 <span class="lock">Elis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1031" id="FNanchor_1031">[1031]</a></span>
 The <cite>Bible</cite> says that
“Deborah, a prophetess ... judged Israel at that
 <span class="lock">time;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1032" id="FNanchor_1032">[1032]</a></span>
 and speaks
of Huldah, another prophetess, who “dwelt in Jerusalem, <em>in the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>college</em>;”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1033" id="FNanchor_1033">[1033]</a></span>
and <cite>2 Samuel</cite> mentions “<em>wise</em> women” several
 <span class="lock">times,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1034" id="FNanchor_1034">[1034]</a></span>
 notwithstanding
the injunction of Moses not to use either divination or augury. As to
the final and conclusive identification of the “Lord God” of Israel with
Moloch, we find a very suspicious evidence of the case in the last chapter
of <cite>Leviticus</cite>, concerning <em>things devoted not to be redeemed</em>.... A man
shall devote unto the Lord of all that he hath, <em>both of man</em> and beast....
None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed, <em>but
shall surely be put to death</em> ... for it is <em>most holy unto the</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Lord</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1035" id="FNanchor_1035">[1035]</a></span></p>

<p>The duality, if not the plurality of the gods of Israel may be inferred
from the very fact of such bitter denunciations. Their prophets <em>never
approved of sacrificial worship</em>. Samuel denied that the Lord had any
delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices (<cite>1 Samuel</cite>, <abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 22). Jeremiah asserted,
unequivocally, that the Lord, Yava Sabaoth Elohe Israel, never
commanded anything of the sort, but contrariwise (<abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 21-24).</p>

<p>But these prophets who opposed themselves to human sacrifices were
all <i>nazars</i> and <i>initiates</i>. These prophets led a party in the nation against
the priests, as later the Gnostics contended against the Christian Fathers.
Hence, when the monarchy was divided, we find the priests at Jerusalem
and the prophets in the country of Israel. Even Ahab and his sons, who
introduced the Tyrian worship of Baal-Hercules and the Syrian goddess
into Israel, were aided and encouraged by Elijah and Elisha. Few
prophets appeared in Judea till Isaiah, after the northern monarchy had
been overthrown. Elisha anointed Jehu on purpose that he should destroy
the royal families of both countries, and so unite the people into
one civil polity. For the Temple of Solomon, desecrated by the priests,
no Hebrew prophet or initiate cared a straw. Elijah never went to it,
nor Elisha, Jonah, Nahum, Amos, or any other Israelite. While the
initiates were holding to the “secret doctrine” of Moses, the people, led
by their priests, were steeped in idolatry exactly the same as that of the
Pagans. It is the popular views and interpretations of Jehovah that the
Christians have adopted.</p>

<p>The question is likely to be asked: “In the view of so much evidence
to show that Christian theology is only a <i lang="fr">pot-pourri</i> of Pagan
mythologies, how can it be connected with the religion of Moses?” The
early Christians, Paul and his disciples, the Gnostics and their successors
generally, regarded Christianity and Judaism as essentially distinct. The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_526">526</a></span>

latter, in their view, was an antagonistic system, and from a lower origin.
“Ye received the law,” said Stephen, “from the ministration of angels,”
or æons, and not from the Most High Himself. The Gnostics, as we
have seen, taught that Jehovah, the Deity of the Jews, was Ilda-Baoth,
the son of the ancient <i>Bohu</i>, or Chaos, the adversary of Divine Wisdom.</p>

<p>The question may be more than easily answered. The <em>law of Moses,
and the so-called monotheism of the Jews, can hardly be said to have been
more than two or three centuries older than Christianity</em>. The <cite>Pentateuch</cite>
itself, we are able to show, was written and revised upon this “new
departure,” at a period subsequent to the colonization of Judea under
the authority of the kings of Persia. The Christian Fathers, in their
eagerness to make their new system dovetail with Judaism, and so avoid
Paganism, unconsciously shunned Scylla only to be caught in the whirlpool
of Charybdis. Under the monotheistic stucco of Judaism was unearthed
the same familiar mythology of Paganism. But we should not regard the
Israelites with less favor for having had a Moloch and being like the
natives. Nor should we compel the Jews to do penance for their
fathers. They had their prophets and their law, and were satisfied with
them. How faithfully and nobly they have stood by their ancestral
faith under the most diabolical persecutions, the present remains of a
once-glorious people bear witness. The Christian world has been in a
state of convulsion from the first to the present century; it has been
cleft into thousands of sects; but the Jews remain substantially united.
Even their differences of opinion do not destroy their unity.</p>

<p>The Christian virtues inculcated by Jesus in the sermon on the mount
are nowhere exemplified in the Christian world. The Buddhist ascetics
and Indian fakirs seem almost the only ones that inculcate and practice
them. Meanwhile the vices which coarse-mouthed slanderers have attributed
to Paganism, are current everywhere among Christian Fathers and
Christian Churches.</p>

<p>The boasted wide gap between Christianity and Judaism, that is
claimed on the authority of Paul, exists but in the imagination of the
pious. We are nought but the inheritors of the intolerant Israelites of
ancient days; not the Hebrews of the time of Herod and the Roman
dominion, who, with all their faults, kept strictly orthodox and monotheistic,
but the Jews who, under the name of Jehovah-Nissi, worshipped
Bacchus-Osiris, Dio-Nysos, the multiform Jove of Nyssa, the Sinai of
Moses. The kabalistic demons—allegories of the profoundest meaning—were
adopted as objective entities, and a Satanic hierarchy carefully
drawn by the orthodox demonologists.</p>

<p>The Rosicrucian motto, “<i lang="la">Igne natura renovatur integra</i>,” which the
alchemists interpret as nature renovated by fire, or matter by spirit, is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_527">527</a></span>

made to be accepted to this day as <i>Iesus Nazarenus rex Iudæorum</i>. The
mocking satire of Pilate is accepted literally, and the Jews made to
unwittingly confess thereby the royalty of Christ; whereas, if the inscription
is not a forgery of the Constantinian period, it yet is the action of
Pilate, against which the Jews were first to violently protest. I. H. S. is
interpreted <i lang="la">Iesus Hominum Salvator</i>, and <i lang="la">In hoc signo</i>, whereas ΙΗΣ is one
of the most ancient names of Bacchus. And more than ever do we begin
to find out, by the bright light of comparative theology, that the great
object of Jesus, the initiate of the inner sanctuary, was to open the eyes
of the fanatical multitude to the difference between the highest Divinity—the
mysterious and never-mentioned ΙΑΟ of the ancient Chaldean and
later Neo-platonic initiates—and the Hebrew Yahuh, or Yaho (Jehovah).
The modern Rosicrucians, so violently denounced by the Catholics, now
find brought against them, as the most important charge, the fact that
they accuse Christ of having destroyed the worship of Jehovah. Would
to Heaven he could have been allowed the time to do so, for the world
would not have found itself still bewildered, after nineteen centuries of
mutual massacres, among 300 quarrelling sects, and with a personal
Devil reigning over a terrorized Christendom!</p>

<p>True to the exclamation of David, paraphrased in <cite>King James’ Version</cite>
as “all the gods of the nations are idols,” <i>i.e.</i>, devils, Bacchus or the
“first-born” or the Orphic theogony, the Monogenes, or “only-begotten”
of Father Zeus and Koré, was transformed, with the rest of the
ancient myths, into a devil. By such a degradation, the Fathers, whose
pious zeal could only be surpassed by their ignorance, have unwittingly
furnished evidence against themselves. They have, with their own hands,
paved the way for many a future solution, and greatly helped modern
students of the science of religions.</p>

<p>It was in the Bacchus-myth that lay concealed for long and dreary
centuries both the future vindication of the reviled “gods of the nations,”
and the last clew to the enigma of Jehovah. The strange duality of
Divine and mortal characteristics, so conspicuous in the Sinaitic Deity,
begins to yield its mystery before the untiring inquiry of the age. One
of the latest contributions we find in a short but highly-important paper
in the <cite>Evolution</cite>, a periodical of New York, the closing paragraph of
which throws a flood of light on Bacchus, the Jove of Nysa, who was
worshipped by the Israelites as Jehovah of Sinai.</p>

<p>“Such was the Jove of Nysa to his worshippers,” concludes the author.
“He represented to them alike the world of nature and the world of
thought. He was the ‘Sun of righteousness, with healing on his wings,’
and he not only brought joy to mortals, but opened to them hope beyond
mortality of immortal life. Born of a human mother, he raised her from

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_528">528</a></span>

the world of death to the supernal air, to be revered and worshipped. At
once lord of all worlds, he was in them all alike the Saviour.</p>

<p>“Such was Bacchus, the prophet-god. A change of cultus, decreed
by the Murderer-Imperial, the Emperor Theodosius, at the instance of
Ghostly-Father Ambrosius, of Milan, has changed his title to Father of
Lies. His worship, before universal, was denominated Pagan or <em>local</em>,
and his rites stigmatized as witchcraft. His orgies received the name
of <i>Witches’ Sabbath</i>, and his favorite symbolical form with the bovine
foot became the modern representative of the Devil with the cloven hoof.
The master of the house having been called Beelzebub, they of his household
were alike denounced as having commerce with the powers of darkness.
Crusades were undertaken; whole peoples massacred. Knowledge
and the higher learning were denounced as magic and sorcery. Ignorance
became the mother of devotion—such as was then cherished. Galileo
languished long years in prison for teaching that the sun was in the centre
of the solar universe. Bruno was burned alive at Rome in 1600 for
reviving the ancient philosophy; yet, queerly enough, the Liberalia have
become a festival of the
 <span class="lock">Church,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1036" id="FNanchor_1036">[1036]</a></span>
 Bacchus is a saint in the calendar four
times repeated, and at many a shrine he may be seen reposing in the
arms of his deified mother. The names are changed; the ideas remain as
<span class="lock">before.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1037" id="FNanchor_1037">[1037]</a></span></p>

<p>And now that we have shown that we must indeed “bid an eternal
farewell to all the rebellious angels,” we naturally pass to an examination
of the God Jesus, who was manufactured out of the man Jesus to redeem
us from these very mythical devils, as Father Ventura shows us. This
labor will of course necessitate once more a comparative inquiry into the
history of Gautama-Buddha, his doctrines and his “miracles,” and those
of Jesus and the predecessor of both—Christna.</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Unluckily</span> for those who would have been glad to render justice
to the ancient and modern religious philosophies of the Orient, a
fair opportunity has hardly ever been given to them. Of late there has
been a touching accord between philologists holding high official positions,
and missionaries from heathen lands. Prudence before truth when
the latter endangers our sinecures! Besides, how easy to compromise
with conscience. A State religion is a prop of government; all State
religions are “exploded humbugs”; therefore, since one is as good, or
rather as bad, as another, <em>the</em> State religion may as well be supported.
Such is the diplomacy of official science.</p>

<p>Grote in his <cite>History of Greece</cite>, assimilates the Pythagoreans to the
Jesuits, and sees in their Brotherhood but an ably-disguised object to
acquire political ascendancy. On the loose testimony of Herakleitus
and some other writers, who accused Pythagoras of craft, and described
him as a man “of extensive research... but artful for mischief and
destitute of sound judgment,” some historical biographers hastened to
present him to posterity in such a character.</p>

<p>How then if they must accept the Pythagoras painted by the satirical
Timon: “a juggler of solemn speech engaged in fishing for men,”
can they avoid judging of Jesus from the sketch that Celsus has embalmed
in his satire? Historical impartiality has nought to do with
creeds and personal beliefs, and exacts as much of posterity for one as
for the other. The life and doings of Jesus are far less attested than

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_530">530</a></span>

those of Pythagoras, if, indeed, we can say that they are attested at all by
any <em>historical</em> proof. For assuredly no one will gainsay that as a real
personage Celsus has the advantage as regards the credibility of his testimony
over Matthew, or Mark, or Luke, or John, who never wrote a
line of the <cite>Gospels</cite> attributed to them respectively. Withal Celsus is at
least as good a witness as Herakleitus. He was known as a scholar and
a Neo-platonist to some of the Fathers; whereas the very existence of
the four Apostles must be taken on blind faith. If Timon regarded the
sublime Samian as “a juggler,” so did Celsus hold Jesus, or rather those
who made all the pretenses for him. In his famous work, addressing
the Nazarene, he says: “Let us grant that the wonders were performed
by you ... but are they not common with those who have been taught
by the Egyptians to perform in the middle of the forum for a few oboli.”
And we know, on the authority of the <cite>Gospel according to Matthew</cite>, that
the Galilean prophet was also a man of solemn speech, and that he called
himself and offered to make his disciples “fishers of men.”</p>

<p>Let it not be imagined that we bring this reproach to any who revere
Jesus as God. Whatever the faith, if the worshipper be but sincere, it
should be respected in his presence. If we do not accept Jesus as God,
we revere <em>him as a man</em>. Such a feeling honors him more than if we
were to attribute to him the powers and personality of the Supreme, and
credit him at the same time with having played a useless comedy with
mankind, as, after all, his mission proves scarcely less than a complete
failure; 2,000 years have passed, and Christians do not reckon one-fifth
part of the population of the globe, nor is Christianity likely to progress
any better in the future. No, we aim but at strict justice, leaving all personality
aside. We question those who, adoring neither Jesus, Pythagoras,
nor Apollonius, yet recite the idle gossip of their contemporaries; those
who in their books either maintain a prudent silence, or speak of “our
Saviour” and “our Lord,” as though they believed any more in the
made-up theological Christ, than in the fabulous Fo of China.</p>

<p><em>There were no Atheists in those days of old; no disbelievers or materialists,
in the modern sense of the word, as there were no bigoted detractors.</em>
He who judges the ancient philosophies by their external
phraseology, and quotes from ancient writings sentences <em>seemingly</em>
atheistical, is unfit to be trusted as a critic, for he is unable to penetrate
into the inner sense of their metaphysics. The views of Pyrrho, whose
rationalism has become proverbial, can be interpreted only by the light
of the oldest Hindu philosophy. From Manu down to the latest Swâbhâvika,
its leading metaphysical feature ever was to proclaim the reality
and supremacy of spirit, with a vehemence proportionate to the denial
of the objective existence of our material world—passing phantom of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_531">531</a></span>

temporary forms and beings. The numerous schools begotten by Kapila,
reflect his philosophy no clearer than the doctrines left as a legacy
to thinkers by Timon, Pyrrho’s “Prophet,” as Sextus Empiricus calls
him. His views on the divine repose of the soul, his proud indifference
to the opinion of his fellow men, his contempt for sophistry, reflect in an
equal degree stray beams of the self-contemplation of the Gymnosophists
and of the Buddhist <i>Vaibhâshika</i>. Notwithstanding that he and his followers
are termed, from their state of constant suspense, “skeptics,”
“doubters,” inquirers, and ephectics, only because they postponed their
final judgment on dilemmas, with which our modern philosophers prefer
dealing, Alexander-like, by cutting the Gordian knot, and then declaring
the dilemma a superstition, such men as Pyrrho cannot be pronounced
atheists. No more can Kapila, or Giordano Bruno, or again Spinoza,
who were also treated as atheists; nor yet, the great Hindu poet, philosopher,
and dialectician, Veda-Vyasa, whose principle that all is illusion—save
the Great Unknown and His direct essence—Pyrrho has adopted
in full.</p>

<p>These philosophical beliefs extended like a net-work over the whole
pre-Christian world; and, surviving persecution and misrepresentations,
form the corner-stone of every now existing religion outside Christianity.</p>

<p>Comparative theology is a two-edged weapon, and has so proved
itself. But the Christian advocates, unabashed by evidence, force comparison
in the serenest way; Christian legends and dogmas, they say,
do somewhat resemble the heathen, it is true; but see, while the one
teaches us the existence, powers, and attributes of an all-wise, all-good
Father-God, Brahmanism gives us a multitude of minor gods, and Buddhism
none whatever; one is fetishism and polytheism, the other bald
atheism. Jehovah is the one true God, and the Pope and Martin Luther
are His prophets! This is one edge of the sword, and this the other:
Despite missions, despite armies, despite enforced commercial intercourse,
the “heathen” find nothing in the teachings of Jesus—sublime
though some are—that Christna and Gautama had not taught them
before. And so, to gain over any new converts, and keep the few
already won by centuries of cunning, the Christians give the “heathen”
dogmas more absurd than their own, and cheat them by adopting the habit
of their native priests, and practicing the very “idolatry and fetishism”
which they so disparage in the “heathens.” Comparative theology
works both ways.</p>

<p>In Siam and Burmah, Catholic missionaries have become perfect
Talapoins to all external appearance, <i>i.e.</i>, minus their virtues; and
throughout India, especially in the south, they were denounced by their

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_532">532</a></span>

own colleague, the Abbé
 <span class="lock">Dubois.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1038" id="FNanchor_1038">[1038]</a></span>
 This was afterward vehemently
denied. But now we have living witnesses to the correctness of the
charge. Among others, Captain O’Grady, already quoted, a native of
Madras, writes the following on this systematic method of
 <span class="lock">deception:<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1039" id="FNanchor_1039">[1039]</a></span>
“The hypocritical beggars profess total abstinence and horror of flesh to
conciliate converts from Hinduism.... I got one father, or rather, he
got himself gloriously drunk in my house, time and again, and the way
he pitched into roast beef was a caution.” Further, the author has pretty
stories to tell of “black-faced Christs,” “Virgins on wheels,” and of
Catholic processions in general. We have seen such solemn ceremonies
accompanied by the most infernal cacophony of a Cingalese orchestra,
tam-tam and gongs included, followed by a like Brahmanic procession,
which, for its picturesque coloring and <i lang="fr">mise en scène</i>, looked far more
solemn and imposing than the Christian saturnalias. Speaking of one of
these, the same author remarks: “It was more devilish than religious....
The bishops walked off
 <span class="lock">Romeward,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1040" id="FNanchor_1040">[1040]</a></span>
 with a mighty pile of Peter’s
pence gathered in the minutest sums, with gold ornaments, nose-rings,
anklets, elbow bangles, etc., etc., in profusion, recklessly thrown in heaps
at the feet of the grotesque copper-colored image of the Saviour, with its
Dutch metal halo and gaudily-striped cummerbund and—shade of Raphael!—blue
<span class="lock">turban.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1041" id="FNanchor_1041">[1041]</a></span></p>

<p>As every one can see, such voluntary contributions make it quite
profitable to mimic the native Brahmans and bonzes. Between the
worshippers of Christna and Christ, or Avany and the Virgin Mary, there
is less substantial difference, in fact, than between the two native sects,
the Vishnavites and the Sivites. For the <em>converted</em> Hindus, Christ is a
slightly modified Christna, that is all. Missionaries carry away rich donations
and Rome is satisfied. Then comes a year of famine; but the
nose-rings and gold elbow-bangles are gone and people starve by thousands.
What matters it? They die in Christ, and Rome scatters her
blessings over their corpses, of which thousands float yearly down the
sacred rivers to the
 <span class="lock">ocean.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1042" id="FNanchor_1042">[1042]</a></span>
 So servile are the Catholics in their imitation,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_533">533</a></span>

and so careful not to give offense to their parishioners, that if they
happen to have a few higher caste converts in a Church, no pariah nor
any man of the lower castes, however good a Christian he may be, can
be admitted into the same Church with them. And yet they dare call
themselves the servants of Him who sought in preference the society of
the publicans and sinners; and whose appeal—“Come unto me all ye
that are heavy laden, and I will give you rest” has opened to him the
hearts of millions of the suffering and the oppressed!</p>

<p>Few writers are as bold and outspoken as the late lamented Dr.
Thomas Inman, of Liverpool, England. But however small their number,
these men all agree unanimously, that the philosophy of both Buddhism
and Brahmanism must rank higher than Christian theology, and teach
neither atheism or fetishism. “To my own mind,” says Inman, “the
assertion that Sakya did not believe in God is wholly unsupported. Nay,
his whole scheme is built upon the belief that there are powers above
which are capable of punishing mankind for their sins. It is true that
these gods were not called Elohim, nor Jah, nor Jehovah, nor Jahveh,
nor Adonai, nor Ehieh, nor Baalim, nor Ashtoreth—yet, for the son of
Suddhadana, there was a Supreme
 <span class="lock">Being.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1043" id="FNanchor_1043">[1043]</a></span></p>

<p>There are four schools of Buddhist theology, in Ceylon, Thibet, and
India. One is rather pantheistical than atheistical, but the other three
are purely <em>theistical</em>.</p>

<p>On the first the speculations of our philologists are based. As to the
second, third, and the fourth, their teachings vary but in the external mode
of expression. We have fully explained the spirit of it elsewhere.</p>

<p>As to practical, not theoretical views on the Nirvana, this is what a rationalist
and a skeptic says: “I have questioned at the very doors of
their temples several hundreds of Buddhists, and have not found one but
strove, fasted, and gave himself up to every kind of austerity, to perfect
himself and acquire immortality; not to attain final annihilation.</p>

<p>“There are over 300,000,000 of Buddhists who fast, pray, and toil....
Why make of these 300,000,000 of men idiots and fools, macerating
their bodies and imposing upon themselves most fearful privations of
every nature, in order to reach a fatal annihilation which must overtake
them <span class="lock">anyhow?”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1044" id="FNanchor_1044">[1044]</a></span></p>

<p>As well as this author we have questioned Buddhists and Brahmanists
and studied their philosophy. <i>Apavarg</i> has wholly a different meaning

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_534">534</a></span>

from annihilation. It is but to become more and more like Him, of
whom he is one of the refulgent sparks, that is the aspiration of every
Hindu philosopher and the hope of the most ignorant is <em>never to yield up
his distinct individuality</em>. “Else,” as once remarked an esteemed correspondent
of the author, “mundane and separate existence would look
like God’s comedy and our tragedy; sport to Him that we work and
suffer, death to us to suffer it.”</p>

<p>The same with the doctrine of metempsychosis, so distorted by European
scholars. But as the work of translation and analysis progresses,
fresh religious beauties will be discovered in the old faiths.</p>

<p>Professor Whitney has in his translation of the <cite>Vedas</cite> passages in
which he says, the assumed importance of the body to its old tenant is
brought out in the strongest light. These are portions of hymns read
at the funeral services, over the body of the departed one. We quote
them from Mr. Whitney’s scholarly work:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry small">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Start onward! bring together all thy members;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">let not thy limbs be left, nor yet thy body;</div>

    <div class="verse indent6">Wherever it delights thee, go thou thither.”</div>

    <div class="poemcenter"> *     *     *     *     *</div>

         Fathers!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1045" id="FNanchor_1045">[1045]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The “body” here referred to is not the physical, but the <em>astral</em> one—a
very great distinction, as may be seen.</p>

<p>Again, belief in the individual existence of the immortal spirit of man
is shown in the following verses of the Hindu ceremonial of incremation
and burial.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">“They who within the sphere of earth are stationed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">or who are settled now in realms of pleasure,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The “fore-heaven” the third heaven is styled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">and where the Fathers have their seat.”—(<cite>Rig-Veda</cite>, <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>With such majestic views as these people held of God and the immortality
of man’s spirit, it is not surprising that a comparison between the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_535">535</a></span>

Vedic hymns and the narrow, unspiritual Mosaic books should result to
the advantage of the former in the mind of every unprejudiced scholar.
Even the ethical code of <cite>Manu</cite> is incomparably higher than that of the
<cite>Pentateuch</cite> of Moses, in the literal meaning of which all the uninitiated
scholars of two worlds cannot find a single proof that the ancient Jews
believed either in a future life or an immortal spirit in man, or that Moses
himself ever taught it. Yet, we have eminent Orientalists who begin to
suspect that the “dead letter” conceals something not apparent at first
sight. So Professor Whitney tells us that “as we look yet further into
the forms of the modern Hindu ceremonial we discover not a little of the
same discordance between creed and observance; the one is not explained
by the other,” says this great American scholar. He adds: “We are
forced to the conclusion either that India derived its system of rites from
some foreign source, and practiced them blindly, careless of their true
import, or <em>else that those rites are the production of another doctrine of
older date</em>, and have maintained themselves in popular usage after the
decay of the creed of which they were the original
 <span class="lock">expression.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1046" id="FNanchor_1046">[1046]</a></span></p>

<p>This creed has not decayed, and its hidden philosophy, as understood
now by the initiated Hindus, is just as it was 10,000 years ago. But can
our scholars seriously hope to have it delivered unto them upon their first
demand? Or do they still expect to fathom the mysteries of the World-Religion
in its popular exoteric rites?</p>

<p>No orthodox Brahmans and Buddhists would deny the Christian
incarnation; only, they understand it in their own philosophical way, and
how could they deny it? The very corner-stone of their religious system
is periodical incarnations of the Deity. Whenever humanity is about
merging into materialism and moral degradation, a Supreme Spirit incarnates
himself in his creature selected for the purpose. The “Messenger
of the Highest” links itself with the duality of matter and soul, and the
triad being thus completed by the union of its Crown, a saviour is born,
who helps restore humanity to the path of truth and virtue. The early
Christian Church, all imbued with Asiatic philosophy, evidently shared
the same belief—otherwise <em>it would have neither erected into an article of
faith the second advent, nor cunningly invented the fable of Anti-Christ
as a precaution against possible future incarnations</em>. Neither could they
have imagined that Melchisedek was an avatar of Christ. They had
only to turn to the <cite>Bagavedgitta</cite> to find Christna or Bhagaved saying
to Arjuna: “He who follows me is saved by wisdom and even by works....
<em>As often as virtue declines in the world, I make myself manifest to
save it.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_536">536</a></span>

Indeed, it is more than difficult to avoid sharing this doctrine of
periodical incarnations. Has not the world witnessed, at rare intervals,
the advent of such grand characters as Christna, Sakya-muni, and Jesus?
Like the two latter personages, Christna seems to have been a real being,
deified by his school at some time in the twilight of history, and made to
fit into the frame of the time-honored religious programme. Compare
the two Redeemers, the Hindu and the Christian, the one preceding the
other by some thousands of years; place between them Siddhârtha
Buddha, reflecting Christna and projecting into the night of the future his
own luminous shadow, out of whose collected rays were shaped the outlines
of the mythical Jesus, and from whose teachings were drawn those
of the historical Christos; and we find that under one identical garment
of poetical legend lived and breathed three real human figures. The
individual merit of each of them is rather brought out in stronger relief
than otherwise by this same mythical coloring; for no unworthy character
could have been selected for deification by the popular instinct, so unerring
and just when left untrammeled. <i lang="la">Vox populi, vox Dei</i> was once true,
however erroneous when applied to the present priest-ridden mob.</p>

<p>Kapila, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, Basilides, Marcian, Ammonius and
Plotinus, founded schools and sowed the germs of many a noble thought,
and disappearing left behind them the refulgence of demi-gods. But the
three personalities of Christna, Gautama, and Jesus appeared like true
gods, each in his epoch, and bequeathed to humanity three religions built on
the imperishable rock of ages. That all three, especially the Christian
faith, have in time become adulterated, and the latter almost unrecognizable,
is no fault of either of the noble Reformers. It is the priestly self-styled
husbandmen of the “vine of the Lord” who must be held to
account by future generations. Purify the three systems of the dross of
human dogmas, the pure essence remaining will be found identical. Even
Paul, the great, the honest apostle, in the glow of his enthusiasm either
unwittingly perverted the doctrines of Jesus, or else his writings are disfigured
beyond recognition. The <cite>Talmud</cite>, the record of a people who,
notwithstanding his apostasy from Judaism, yet feel compelled to acknowledge
Paul’s greatness as a philosopher and religionist, says of Aher
 <span class="lock">(Paul),<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1047" id="FNanchor_1047">[1047]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_537">537</a></span>

in the <cite>Yerushalmi</cite>, that “he corrupted the work of that man”—meaning
<span class="lock">Jesus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1048" id="FNanchor_1048">[1048]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, before this smelting is completed by honest science and
future generations, let us glance at the present aspect of the legendary
three religions.</p>

<p>Such is the present aspect of these three great religions, of which
each is in turn reflected in its successor. Had the Christian dogmatizers
stopped there, the results would not have been so disastrous, for it would
be hard, indeed, to make a bad creed out of the lofty teachings of Gautama,
or Christna, as <i>Bhagaved</i>. But they went farther, and added to
pure primitive Christianity the fables of Hercules, Orpheus, and Bacchus.
As Mussulmans will not admit that their <cite>Koran</cite> is built on the
substratum of the Jewish <cite>Bible</cite>, so the Christians will not confess that
they owe next to everything to the Hindu religions. But the Hindus
have chronology to prove it to them. We see the best and most learned
of our writers uselessly striving to show that the extraordinary similarities—amounting
to identity—between Christna and Christ are due to the
spurious <cite>Gospels of the Infancy</cite> and of <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas</cite> having “probably
circulated on the coast of Malabar, and giving color to the story of
 <span class="lock">Christna.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1051" id="FNanchor_1051">[1051]</a></span>
 Why not accept truth in all sincerity, and reversing matters,
admit that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Thomas, faithful to that policy of proselytism which
marked the earliest Christians, when he found in Malabar the original
of the mythical Christ in Christna, tried to blend the two; and, adopting
in his gospel (from which all others were copied) the most important details
of the story of the Hindu Avatar, engrafted the Christian heresy on
the primitive religion of Christna. For any one acquainted with the
spirit of Brahmanism, the idea of Brahmans accepting anything from a
stranger, especially from a foreigner, is simply ridiculous. That they,
the most fanatic people in religious matters, who, during centuries,
cannot be compelled to adopt the most simple of European usages,
should be suspected of having introduced into their sacred books unverified

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_540">540</a></span>

legends about a foreign God, is something so preposterously illogical,
that it is really waste of time to contradict the idea!</p>

<p>We will not stop to examine the too well-known resemblances
between the external form of Buddhistic worship—especially Lamaism—and
Roman Catholicism, for noticing which poor Huc paid dear—but
proceed to compare the most vital points. Of all the original manuscripts

 The reading of these two books, and the discovery
in them of similarities of thought and doctrine often amounting
to identity, prompted Dr. Inman to write the many profoundly true passages
embodied in one of his last works, <cite>Ancient Faith and</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>Modern</cite>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1054" id="FNanchor_1054">[1054]</a></span>
“I speak with sober earnestness,” writes this kind-hearted, sincere
scholar, “when I say that after forty years’ experience among those who
profess Christianity, and those who proclaim ... more or less quietly
their disagreement with it, I have noticed more sterling virtue and morality
amongst the last than the first.... I know personally many pious,
good Christian people, whom I honor, admire, and, perhaps, would be
glad to emulate or to equal; but they deserve the eulogy thus passed on
them, in consequence of their good sense, having ignored the doctrine
of faith to a great degree, and having cultivated the practice of good
works.... In my judgment the most praiseworthy Christians whom I
know are <em>modified Buddhists</em>, though probably, not one of them ever
heard of <span class="lock">Siddârtha.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1055" id="FNanchor_1055">[1055]</a></span></p>

<p>Between the Lamaico-Buddhistic and Roman Catholic articles of
faith and ceremonies, there are fifty-one points presenting a perfect and
striking similarity; and four diametrically antagonistic.</p>

may find them carefully noted in Inman’s work on <i>Ancient Faith and

<p>Which of these theologies most commends itself to the sincere
inquirer, is a question that may safely be left to the sound judgment of
the reader. One offers light, the other darkness.</p>

<p>The <cite>Wheel of the Law</cite> has the following:</p>

<p>“Buddhists believe that every act, word, or thought has its consequence,
which will appear sooner or later in the present or in the future
state. Evil acts will produce evil
 <span class="lock">consequences,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1057" id="FNanchor_1057">[1057]</a></span>
 good acts will produce
good consequences: prosperity in this world, or birth in heaven
... in some future
 <span class="lock">state.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1058" id="FNanchor_1058">[1058]</a></span></p>

<p>This is strict and impartial justice. This is the idea of a Supreme
Power which cannot fail, and therefore, can have neither wrath nor
mercy, but leaves every cause, great or small, to work out its inevitable
effects. “With what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you
 <span class="lock">again”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1059" id="FNanchor_1059">[1059]</a></span>
 neither by expression nor implication points to any hope of
future mercy or salvation by proxy. Cruelty and mercy are finite feelings.
The Supreme Deity is infinite, hence it can only be <span class="allsmcap">JUST</span>, and
Justice must be blind. The ancient Pagans held on this question far
more philosophical views than modern Christians, for they represented
their Themis blindfold. And the Siamese author of the work under
notice, has again a more reverent conception of the Deity than the Christians
have, when he thus gives vent to his thought: “A Buddhist might
believe in the existence of a God, sublime above all human qualities and
attributes—a perfect God, above love, and hatred, and jealousy, calmly
resting in a quiet happiness that nothing could disturb; and of such a
God he would speak no disparagement, not from a desire to please Him,
or fear to offend Him, but from natural veneration. But he cannot
understand a God with the attributes and qualities of men, a God who
loves and hates, and shows anger; a Deity, who, whether described to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_542">542</a></span>

him by Christian missionaries, or by Mahometans, or Brahmans, or Jews,
falls below his standard of even an ordinary good
 <span class="lock">man.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1060" id="FNanchor_1060">[1060]</a></span></p>

<p>We have often wondered at the extraordinary ideas of God and His
justice that seem to be honestly held by those Christians who blindly
rely upon the clergy for their religion, and never upon their own reason.
How strangely illogical is this doctrine of the Atonement. We propose
to discuss it with the Christians from the Buddhistic stand-point, and show
at once by what a series of sophistries, directed toward the one object
of tightening the ecclesiastical yoke upon the popular neck, its acceptance
as a divine command has been finally effected; also, that it has
proved one of the most pernicious and demoralizing of doctrines.</p>

<p>The clergy say: no matter how enormous our crimes against the laws
of God and of man, we have but to believe in the self-sacrifice of Jesus
for the salvation of mankind, and His blood will wash out every stain.
God’s mercy is boundless and unfathomable. It is impossible to conceive
of a human sin so damnable that the price paid in advance for the
redemption of the sinner would not wipe it out if a thousandfold worse.
And, furthermore, it is never too late to repent. Though the offender
wait until the last minute of the last hour of the last day of his mortal life,
before his blanched lips utter the confession of faith, he may go to Paradise;
the dying thief did it, and so may all others as vile. These are the
assumptions of the Church.</p>

<p>But if we step outside the little circle of creed and consider the universe
as a whole balanced by the exquisite adjustment of parts, how all
sound logic, how the faintest glimmering sense of Justice revolts against
this Vicarious Atonement! If the criminal sinned only against himself,
and wronged no one but himself; if by sincere repentance he could cause
the obliteration of past events, not only from the memory of man, but also
from that imperishable record, which no deity—not even the Supremest
of the Supreme—can cause to disappear, then this dogma might not be
incomprehensible. But to maintain that one may wrong his fellow-man,
kill, disturb the equilibrium of society, and the natural order of things, and
then—through cowardice, hope, or compulsion, matters not—be forgiven
by believing that the spilling of one blood washes out the other blood
spilt—this is preposterous! Can the <em>results</em> of a crime be obliterated
even though the crime itself should be pardoned? The effects of a cause
are never limited to the boundaries of the cause, nor can the results of
crime be confined to the offender and his victim. Every good as well as
evil action has its effects, as palpably as the stone flung into a calm
water. The simile is trite, but it is the best ever conceived, so let us use

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_543">543</a></span>

it. The eddying circles are greater and swifter, as the disturbing object
is greater or smaller, but the smallest pebble, nay, the tiniest speck,
makes its ripples. And this disturbance is not alone visible and on the
surface. Below, unseen, in every direction—outward and downward—drop
pushes drop until the sides and bottom are touched by the force.
More, the air above the water is agitated, and this disturbance passes, as
the physicists tell us, from stratum to stratum out into space forever and
ever; an impulse has been given to matter, and that is never lost, can
never be recalled!...</p>

<p>So with crime, and so with its opposite. The action may be instantaneous,
the effects are eternal. When, after the stone is once flung
into the pond, we can recall it to the hand, roll back the ripples, obliterate
the force expended, restore the etheric waves to their previous state
of non-being, and wipe out every trace of the act of throwing the missile,
so that Time’s record shall not show that it ever happened, then, <em>then</em>
we may patiently hear Christians argue for the efficacy of this Atonement.</p>

<p>The Chicago <cite>Times</cite> recently printed the hangman’s record of the first
half of the present year (1877)—a long and ghastly record of murders
and hangings. Nearly every one of these murderers received religious
consolation, and many announced that they had received God’s forgiveness
through the blood of Jesus, and were going that day to Heaven!
<em>Their conversion was effected in prison.</em> See how this ledger-balance of
Christian Justice (!) stands: These red-handed murderers, urged on by
the demons of lust, revenge, cupidity, fanaticism, or mere brutal thirst
for blood, slew their victims, in most cases, without giving them time to
repent, or call on Jesus to wash them clean with his blood. They, perhaps,
died sinful, and, of course,—consistently with theological logic—met
the reward of their greater or lesser offenses. But the murderer,
overtaken by human justice, is imprisoned, wept over by sentimentalists,
prayed with and at, pronounces the charmed words of conversion, and
goes to the scaffold a redeemed child of Jesus! Except for the murder,
he would not have been prayed with, redeemed, pardoned. Clearly this
man did well to murder, for thus he gained eternal happiness? And
how about the victim, and his or her family, relatives, dependants, social
relations—has Justice no recompense for them? Must they suffer in
this world and the next, while he who wronged them sits beside the
“holy thief” of Calvary and is forever blessed? On this question the
clergy keep a prudent silence.</p>

<p>Steve Anderson was one of these American criminals—convicted of
double murder, arson, and robbery. Before the hour of his death he was
“converted,” but, the record tells us that “<cite>his clerical attendants objected
to his reprieve, on the ground that they felt sure of his salvation</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_544">544</a></span>

<cite>should he die then, but could not answer for it if his execution was postponed</cite>.”
We address these ministers, and ask them to tell us on what
grounds they felt sure of such a monstrous thing. How they could feel
<i>sure</i>, with the dark future before them, and the endless results of this
double murder, arson, and robbery? They could be sure of nothing, but
that their abominable doctrine is the cause of three-fourths of the crimes
of so-called Christians; that these terrific causes must produce like monstrous
effects, which in their turn will beget other results, and so roll on
throughout eternity to an accomplishment that no man can calculate.</p>

<p>Or take another crime, one of the most selfish, cruel, and heartless,
and yet the most frequent, the seduction of a young girl. Society, by an
instinct of self-preservation, pitilessly judges the victim, and ostracizes
her. She may be driven to infanticide, or self-murder, or if too averse to
die, live to plunge into a career of vice and crime. She may become the
mother of criminals, who, as in the now celebrated Jukes, of whose appalling
details Mr. Dugdale has published the particulars, breed other generations
of felons to the number of hundreds, in fifty or sixty years. All this
social disaster came through one man’s selfish passion; shall he be forgiven
by Divine Justice until his offense is expiated, and punishment fall
only upon the wretched human scorpions begotten of his lust?</p>

<p>An outcry has just been made in England over the discovery that
Anglican priests are largely introducing auricular confession and granting
absolution after enforcing penances. Inquiry shows the same thing prevailing
more or less in the United States. Put to the ordeal of cross-examination,
the clergy quote triumphantly from the English <cite>Book of Common
Prayer</cite> the rubrics which clearly give them the absolving authority,
through the power of “God, the Holy Ghost,” committed unto them by
the bishop by imposition of hands at their ordination. The bishop, questioned,
points to <cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="sixteen">xvi.</abbr>, 19, for the source of his authority to bind
and loose on earth those who are to be blessed or damned in heaven;
and to the apostolic succession for proof of its transmission from Simon
Barjona to himself. The present volumes have been written to small
purpose if they have not shown, 1, that Jesus, the Christ-God, is a myth
concocted two centuries after the real Hebrew Jesus died; 2, that,
therefore, he never had any authority to give Peter, or any one else, plenary
power; 3, that even if he had given such authority, the word Petra
(rock) referred to the revealed truths of the Petroma, not to him who
thrice denied him; and that besides, the apostolic succession is a gross
and palpable fraud; 4, that the <cite>Gospel according to Matthew</cite> is a fabrication
based upon a wholly different manuscript. The whole thing,
therefore, is an imposition alike upon priest and penitent. But putting
all these points aside for the moment, it suffices to ask these pretended

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_545">545</a></span>

agents of the three gods of the Trinity, how they reconcile it with the most
rudimental notions of equity, that if the power to pardon sinners for sinning
has been given them, <em>they did not also receive the ability by miracle
to obliterate the wrongs done against person or property</em>. Let them restore
life to the murdered; honor to the dishonored; property to those
who have been wronged, and force the scales of human and divine justice
to recover their equilibrium. Then we may talk of their divine commission
to bind and loose. Let them say, if they can do this. Hitherto
the world has received nothing but sophistry—believed on <em>blind</em> faith;
we ask palpable, tangible evidence of their God’s justice and mercy.
But all are silent; no answer, no reply, and still the inexorable unerring
Law of Compensation proceeds on its unswerving path. If we but watch
its progress, we will find that it ignores all creeds, shows no preferences,
but its sunlight and its thunderbolts fall alike on heathen and Christian.
No absolution can shield the latter when guilty, no anathema hurt the
former when innocent.</p>

<p>Away from us such an insulting conception of divine justice as that
preached by priests on their own authority. It is fit only for cowards
and criminals! If they are backed by a whole array of Fathers and
Churchmen, we are supported by the greatest of all authorities, an instinctive
and reverential sense of the everlasting and everpresent law of
harmony and justice.</p>

<p>But, besides that of reason, we have other evidence to show that such
a construction is wholly unwarranted. The <cite>Gospels</cite> being “Divine revelation,”
doubtless Christians will regard their testimony as conclusive.
Do they affirm that Jesus gave himself as a voluntary sacrifice? On the
contrary, there is not a word to sustain the idea. They make it clear
that he would rather have lived to continue what he considered his mission,
and that <em>he died because he could not help it, and only when betrayed</em>.
Before, when threatened with violence, <em>he had made himself invisible</em> by
employing the mesmeric power over the bystanders, claimed by every
Eastern adept, and escaped. When, finally, he saw that his time had
come, he succumbed to the inevitable. But see him in the garden, on
the Mount of Olives, writhing in agony until “his sweat was, as it were,
great drops of blood,” praying with fervid supplication that the cup might
be removed from him; exhausted by his struggle to such a degree that an
angel from heaven had to come and strengthen him; and say if the picture
is that of a self-immolating hostage and martyr. To crown all, and leave
no lingering doubt in our minds, we have his own despairing words,
“<span class="smcap">Not my will</span>, <em>but thine</em>, be done!” (<cite>Luke</cite> <abbr title="twenty-two">xxii.</abbr> 42, 43.)</p>

<p>Again, in the <cite>Puranas</cite> it may be found that Christna was nailed to
a tree by the arrow of a hunter, who, begging the dying god to forgive

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_546">546</a></span>

him, receives the following answer: “Go, hunter, through my favor, to
Heaven, the abode of the gods.... Then the illustrious Christna, having
united himself with his own pure, spiritual, inexhaustible, inconceivable,
unborn, undecaying, imperishable, and universal Spirit, which is one with
Vasudeva, abandoned his mortal body, and ... he became Nirguna”
(Wilson’s <cite>Vishnu Purana</cite>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 612). Is not this the original of the story
of Christ forgiving the thief on the cross, and promising him a place in
Heaven? Such examples “challenge inquiry as to their origin and meaning
<em>so long anterior to Christianity</em>,” says Dr. Lundy in <cite>Monumental Christianity</cite>,
and yet to all this he adds: “The idea of Krishna as a shepherd,
I take to be older than either (the <cite>Gospel of Infancy</cite> and that of <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
John</cite>), <em>and prophetic of Christ</em>” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 156).</p>

<p>Facts like these, perchance, furnished later a plausible pretext for
declaring apocryphal all such works as the <cite>Homilies</cite>, which proved but
too clearly the utter want of any early authority for the doctrine of
atonement. The <cite>Homilies</cite> clash but little with the <cite>Gospels</cite>; they disagree
entirely with the dogmas of the Church. Peter knew nothing of
the atonement; and his reverence for the mythical father Adam would
never have allowed him to admit that this patriarch had sinned and was
accursed. Neither do the Alexandrian theological schools appear to
have been cognizant of this doctrine, nor Tertullian; nor was it discussed
by any of the earlier Fathers. Philo represents the story of the <em>Fall</em> as
symbolical, and Origen regarded it the same way as Paul, as an
 <span class="lock">allegory.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1061" id="FNanchor_1061">[1061]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether they will or not, the Christians have to credit the foolish
story of Eve’s temptation by a serpent. Besides, Augustine has formally
pronounced upon the subject. “God, by His arbitrary will,” he says,
“has selected beforehand certain persons, <em>without regard to foreseen
faith or good actions, and has irretrievably ordained to bestow upon them
eternal happiness; while He has condemned others in the same way to
eternal reprobation</em>!!” (<i lang="la">De dono</i>
 <span class="lock"><i lang="la">perseverantiæ</i>).<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1062" id="FNanchor_1062">[1062]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_547">547</a></span>

Calvin promulgated views of Divine partiality and bloodthirstiness
equally abhorrent. “The human race, corrupted radically in the fall
with Adam, has upon it the guilt and impotence of original sin; its
redemption can be achieved only through an incarnation and a propitiation;
of this redemption only electing grace can make the soul a participant,
and such grace, once given, is never lost; <em>this election can come only
from God, and it includes only a part of the race, the rest being left to
perdition</em>; election and perdition (the <i lang="la">horribile decretum</i>) are both predestinated
in the Divine plan; that plan is a decree, and this decree is
eternal and unchangeable ... justification is by <em>faith alone</em>, and <em>faith
is the gift of God</em>.”</p>

<p>O Divine Justice, how blasphemed has been thy name! Unfortunately
for all such speculations, belief in the propitiatory efficacy of blood can
be traced to the oldest rites. Hardly a nation remained ignorant of it.
Every people offered animal and even human sacrifices to the gods, in
the hope of averting thereby public calamity, by pacifying the wrath of
some avenging deity. There are instances of Greek and Roman generals
offering their lives simply for the success of their army. Cæsar complains
of it, and calls it a superstition of the Gauls. “They devote
themselves to death ... believing that unless life is rendered for life the
immortal gods cannot be appeased,” he writes. “If any evil is about to
befall either those who now sacrifice, or Egypt, may it be averted on this
head,” was pronounced by the Egyptian priests when sacrificing one of
their sacred animals. And imprecations were uttered over the head of
the expiatory victim, around whose horns a piece of byblus was
 <span class="lock">rolled.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1064" id="FNanchor_1064">[1064]</a></span>
The animal was generally led to some barren region, sacred to Typhon,
in those primitive ages when this fatal deity was yet held in a certain consideration
by the Egyptians. It is in this custom that lies the origin of
the “scape-goat” of the Jews, who, when the rufous ass-god was rejected
by the Egyptians, began sacrificing to another deity the “red heifer.”</p>

<p>“Let all sins that have been committed in this world fall on me that
the world may be delivered,” exclaimed Gautama, the Hindu Saviour,
centuries before our era.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_548">548</a></span>

No one will pretend to assert in our own age that it was the Egyptians
who borrowed anything from the Israelites, as they now accuse the
Hindus of doing. Bunsen, Lepsius, Champollion, have long since
established the precedence of Egypt over the Israelites in age as well as
in all the religious rites that we now recognize among the “chosen people.”
Even the <cite>New Testament</cite> teems with quotations and repetitions
from the <cite>Book of the Dead</cite>, and Jesus, if everything attributed to him by
his four biographers is true—must have been acquainted with the Egyptian
Funereal
 <span class="lock">Hymns.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1065" id="FNanchor_1065">[1065]</a></span>
 In the Gospel according to <cite>Matthew</cite> we find
whole sentences from the ancient and sacred <cite>Ritual</cite> which preceded our
era by more than 4,000 years. We will again
 <span class="lock">compare.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1066" id="FNanchor_1066">[1066]</a></span></p>

<p>The “soul” under trial is brought before Osiris, the “Lord of
Truth,” who sits decorated with the Egyptian cross, emblem of eternal
life, and holding in his right hand the <i>Vannus</i> or the flagellum of
 <span class="lock">justice.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1067" id="FNanchor_1067">[1067]</a></span>
The spirit begins, in the “Hall of the Two Truths,” an earnest appeal,
and enumerates its good deeds, supported by the responses of the forty-two
assessors—<em>its incarnated deeds and accusers</em>. If justified, it is addressed
as Osiris, thus assuming the appellation of the Deity whence its
divine essence proceeded, and the following words, full of majesty and
justice, are pronounced! “Let the <em>Osiris</em> go; ye see he is without
fault.... He lived on truth, he has fed on truth.... <em>The god has
welcomed him</em> as he desired. <em>He has given food to my hungry, drink to
my thirsty ones, clothes to my naked</em>.... He has made the sacred food
of the gods the meat of the spirits.”</p>

<p>In the parable of <cite>the Kingdom of Heaven</cite> (<cite>Matthew</cite>
 <abbr title="twenty-five">xxv.</abbr>), the <em>Son
of Man</em> (Osiris is also called the Son) sits upon the throne of his glory,
judging the nations, and says to the justified, “Come ye blessed of my
Father (<em>the</em> God) inherit the kingdom.... For <cite>I was an hungered, and
ye gave me meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me drink</cite> ... <cite>naked and</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_549">549</a></span>

<cite>ye clothed</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite>me</cite>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1068" id="FNanchor_1068">[1068]</a></span>
 To complete the resemblance (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 12): John
is made to describe Christ as Osiris, “whose <em>fan</em> (winnow or <i>vannus</i>) is
in his hand, and who will “purge his floor and gather his wheat into the
garner.”</p>

<p>The same in relation to Buddhist legends. In <cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> 19,
Jesus is made to say: “Follow me and I will make you <em>fishers</em> of men,”
the whole adapted to a conversation between him and Simon Peter and
Andrew his brother.</p>

<p>In Schmidt’s “<cite lang="de">Der Weise und der</cite>
 <span class="lock"><cite lang="de">Thor</cite>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1069" id="FNanchor_1069">[1069]</a></span>
 a work full of anecdotes
about Buddha and his disciples, the whole from original texts, it is said
of a new convert to the faith, that “he had been caught by the hook of
the doctrine, just as a fish, who has caught at the bait and line is securely
pulled out.” In the temples of Siam the image of the expected Buddha,
the Messiah Maitree, is represented with a fisherman’s net in the hand,
while in Thibet he holds a kind of a trap. The explanation of it reads
as follows: “He (Buddha) disseminates upon the Ocean of birth
and decay the Lotus-flower of the excellent law as <em>a bait</em>; with the loop
of devotion, never cast out in vain, he brings living beings up like fishes,
and carries them to the other side of the river, where there is true
 <span class="lock">understanding.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1070" id="FNanchor_1070">[1070]</a></span></p>

<p>Had the erudite Archbishop Cave, Grabe, and Dr. Parker, who so
zealously contended in their time for the admission of the <cite>Epistles of
Jesus Christ and Abgarus, King of Edessa</cite>, into the Canon of the
<cite>Scripture</cite>, lived in our days of Max Müller and Sanscrit scholarship, we
doubt whether they would have acted as they did. The first mention of
these Epistles ever made, was by the famous Eusebius. This pious
bishop seems to have been self-appointed to furnish Christianity with the
most unexpected proofs to corroborate its wildest fancies. Whether

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_550">550</a></span>

among the many accomplishments of the Bishop of Cæsarea, we must
include a knowledge of the Cingalese, Pehlevi, Thibetan, and other languages,
we know not; but he surely transcribed the letters of Jesus and
Abgarus, and the story of the miraculous portrait of Christ taken on a
piece of cloth, by the simple wiping of his face, from the Buddhistical
Canon. To be sure, the bishop declared that he found the letter himself
written in Syriac, preserved among the registers and records of the
city of Edessa, where Abgarus
 <span class="lock">reigned.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1071" id="FNanchor_1071">[1071]</a></span>
 We recall the words of
Babrias: “Myth, O son of King Alexander, is an ancient human
invention of Syrians, who lived in old time under Ninus and Belus.”
Edessa was one of the ancient “holy cities.” The Arabs venerate it to
this day; and the purest Arabic is there spoken. They call it still by
its ancient name Orfa, once the city <i>Arpha-Kasda</i> (Arphaxad) the seat
of a College of Chaldeans and Magi; whose missionary, called Orpheus,
brought thence the Bacchic Mysteries to Thrace. Very naturally, Eusebius
found there the tales which he wrought over into the story of
Abgarus, and the sacred picture taken on a cloth; as that of Bhagavat,
or the blessed Tathagâta
 <span class="lock">(Buddha)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1072" id="FNanchor_1072">[1072]</a></span>
was obtained by King
 <span class="lock">Binsbisara.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1073" id="FNanchor_1073">[1073]</a></span>
The King having brought it, Bhagavat projected his shadow on
 <span class="lock">it.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1074" id="FNanchor_1074">[1074]</a></span>
This bit of “miraculous stuff,” with its shadow, is still preserved, say the
Buddhists; “only the shadow itself is rarely seen.”</p>

<p>In like manner, the Gnostic author of <cite>the Gospel according to John</cite>,
copied and metamorphosed the legend of Ananda who asked drink of a
Matangha woman—the antitype of the woman met by Jesus at the well,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1075" id="FNanchor_1075">[1075]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_551">551</a></span>

and was reminded by her that she belongs to a low caste, and may have
nothing to do with a holy monk. “I do not ask thee, my sister,” answers
Ananda to the woman, “either thy caste or thy family, I only ask thee
for water, if thou canst give me some.” This Matangha woman, charmed
and moved to tears, repents, joins the monastic Order of Gautama, and
becomes a saint, rescued from a life of unchastity by Sakya-muni. Many
of her subsequent actions were used by Christian forgers, to endow Mary
Magdalen and other female saints and martyrs.</p>

<p>“And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a
cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you,
he shall in no wise lose his reward,” says the Gospel (<cite>Matthew</cite> <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 42).
“Whosoever, with a purely believing heart, offers nothing but a handful
of water, or presents so much to the spiritual assembly, or gives drink
therewith to the poor and needy, or to a beast of the field; this meritorious
action will not be exhausted in many
 <span class="lock">ages,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1076" id="FNanchor_1076">[1076]</a></span>
 says the Buddhist
<cite>Canon</cite>.</p>

<p>At the hour of Gautama-Buddha’s birth there were 32,000 wonders
performed. The clouds stopped immovable in the sky, the waters of
the rivers ceased to flow; the flowers ceased unbudding; the birds remained

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_552">552</a></span>

silent and full of wonder; all nature remained suspended in her
course, and was full of expectation. “There was a preternatural light
spread all over the world; animals suspended their eating; the blind
saw; and the lame and dumb were cured,”
 <span class="lock">etc.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1077" id="FNanchor_1077">[1077]</a></span></p>

<p>We now quote from the <cite>Protevangelion</cite>:</p>

<p>“At the hour of the Nativity, as Joseph looked up into the air, ‘I
saw,’ he says, ‘<em>the clouds astonished</em>, and the fowls of the air stopping in
the midst of their flight.... And I beheld the sheep dispersed ...
and <em>yet the sheep stood still</em>; and I looked into a river, and saw the kids
<em>with their mouths close to the water, and touching it, but they did not
drink</em>.</p>

<p>“<em>Then a bright cloud overshadowed the cave.</em> But on a sudden the
cloud became <em>a great light</em> in the cave, so that their eyes could not bear
it.... The hand of Salomé, which was withered, was straightway
cured.... The blind saw; the lame and dumb were
 <span class="lock">cured.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1078" id="FNanchor_1078">[1078]</a></span></p>

<p>When sent to school, the young Gautama, without having ever
studied, completely worsted all his competitors; not only in writing, but
in arithmetic, mathematics, metaphysics, wrestling, archery, astronomy,
geometry, and finally vanquishes his own professors by giving the definition
of sixty-four kinds of writings, which were unknown to the masters
<span class="lock">themselves.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1079" id="FNanchor_1079">[1079]</a></span></p>

<p>And this is what is said again in the <cite>Gospel of the Infancy</cite>: “And
when he (Jesus) was twelve years old ... a certain principal Rabbi
asked him, ‘Hast thou read books?’ and a certain astronomer asked the
Lord Jesus whether he had studied astronomy. And Lord Jesus
explained to him ... about the spheres ... about the physics and
metaphysics. Also things that reason of man had never discovered....
The constitutions of the body, how the soul operated upon the body,
... etc. And at this the master was so surprised that he said: “I
believe this boy was born before Noah ... he is more learned than
any
 <span class="lock">master.’”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1080" id="FNanchor_1080">[1080]</a></span></p>

<p>The precepts of Hillel, who died forty years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, appear rather as
quotations than original expressions in the Sermon on the Mount. Jesus
taught the world nothing that had not been taught as earnestly before
by other masters. He begins his sermon with certain purely Buddhistic

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_553">553</a></span>

precepts that had found acceptance among the Essenes, and were generally
practiced by the <i>Orphikoi</i>, and the Neo-platonists. There were the
Philhellenes, who, like Apollonius, had devoted their lives to moral and
physical purity, and who practiced asceticism. He tries to imbue the
hearts of his audience with a scorn for worldly wealth; a fakir-like unconcern
for the morrow; love for humanity, poverty, and chastity. He
blesses the poor in spirit, the meek, the hungering and the thirsting after
righteousness, the merciful and the peace-makers, and, Buddha-like, leaves
but a poor chance for the proud castes to enter into the kingdom of
heaven. Every word of his sermon is an echo of the essential principles
of monastic Buddhism. The ten commandments of Buddha, as found in
an appendix to the <cite>Prâtimoksha Sûtra</cite> (Pali-Burman text), are elaborated
to their full extent in <cite>Matthew</cite>. If we desire to acquaint ourselves with
the historical Jesus we have to set the mythical Christ entirely aside, and
learn all we can of the man in the first Gospel. His doctrines, religious
views, and grandest aspirations will be found concentrated in his sermon.</p>

<p>This is the principal cause of the failure of missionaries to convert
Brahmanists and Buddhists. These see that the little of really good that
is offered in the new religion is paraded only in theory, while their own
faith demands that those identical rules shall be applied in practice.
Notwithstanding the impossibility for Christian missionaries to understand
clearly the spirit of a religion wholly based on that doctrine of emanation
which is so inimical to their own theology, the reasoning powers of
some simple Buddhistical preachers are so high, that we see a scholar like
 <span class="lock">Gutzlaff,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1081" id="FNanchor_1081">[1081]</a></span>
 utterly silenced and put to great straits by Buddhists. Judson,
the famous Baptist missionary in Burmah, confesses, in his <i>Journal</i>, the difficulties
to which he was often driven by them. Speaking of a certain Ooyan,
he remarks that his strong mind was capable of grasping the most difficult
subjects. “His words,” he remarks, “are as smooth as oil, as sweet as
honey, and as sharp as razors; his mode of reasoning is soft, insinuating,
and acute; and so adroitly does he act his part, that <em>I with the strength
of truth</em>, was scarcely able to keep him down.” It appears though, that
at a later period of his mission, Mr. Judson found that he had utterly mistaken
the doctrine. “I begin to find,” he says, “that the semi-atheism,
which I had sometimes mentioned, is nothing but a refined Buddhism,
having its foundation in the Buddhistic Scriptures.” Thus he discovered
at last that while there is in Buddhism “a generic term of most exalted
perfection actually applied to numerous individuals, a Buddha superior
to the whole host of subordinate deities,” there are also lurking in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_554">554</a></span>

system “the glimmerings of an <i lang="la">anima mundi</i> anterior to, and even superior
to, <span class="lock">Buddha.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1082" id="FNanchor_1082">[1082]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a happy discovery, indeed!</p>

<p>Even the so-slandered Chinese believe in <i>One</i>, Highest God. “The
Supreme Ruler of Heavens.” Yuh-Hwang-Shang-ti, has his name
inscribed only on the golden tablet before the altar of heaven at the great
temple at Pekin, T’Iantan. “This worship,” says Colonel Yule, “is
mentioned by the Mahometan narrator of Shah Rukh’s embassy (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
1421): ‘Every year there are some days on which the emperor eats no
animal food.... He spends his time in an apartment which contains <em>no
idol</em>, and says that <em>he is worshipping the God of</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>Heaven</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1083" id="FNanchor_1083">[1083]</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking of Shahrastani, the great Arabian scholar, Chwolsohn says
that for him Sabaeism was not astrolatry, as many are inclined to think.
He thought “that God is too sublime and too great to occupy Himself
with the immediate management of this world; that He has, therefore,
transferred the government thereof to the gods, and retained only the
most important affairs for Himself; that further, man is too weak to be
able to apply immediately to the Highest; that he must, therefore,
address his prayers and sacrifices to the intermediate divinities, to whom
the management of the world has been entrusted by the Highest.” Chwolsohn
argues that this idea is as old as the world, and that “in the heathen
world this view was universally shared by the
<span class="lock">cultivated.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1084" id="FNanchor_1084">[1084]</a></span></p>

<p>Father Boori, a Portuguese missionary, who was sent to convert the
“poor heathen” of Cochin-China, as early as the sixteenth century, “protests
in despair, in his narrative, that there is not a dress, office, or ceremony
in the Church of Rome, to which the Devil has not here provided
some counterpart. Even when the Father began inveighing against the
idols, he was answered that these were the images of departed great men,
whom they worshipped exactly on the same principle, and in the same
manner, as the Catholics did the images of the apostles and
 <span class="lock">martyrs.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1085" id="FNanchor_1085">[1085]</a></span>
Moreover, these idols have importance but in the eyes of the ignorant
multitudes. The <em>philosophy</em> of Buddhism ignores images and fetishes.
Its strongest vitality lies in its psychological conceptions of man’s <em>inner</em>
self. The road to the supreme state of felicity, called the Ford of Nirvana,
winds its invisible paths through the spiritual, not physical life of
a person while on this earth. The sacred Buddhistical literature points
the way by stimulating man to follow <em>practically</em> the example of Gautama.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_555">555</a></span>

Therefore, the Buddhistical writings lay a particular stress on the
spiritual privileges of man, advising him to cultivate his powers for the
production of <i>Meipo</i> (phenomena) during life, and for the attainment of
Nirvana in the hereafter.</p>

<p>But turning again from the historical to the mythical narratives,
invented alike about Christna, Buddha, and Christ, we find the following:</p>

<p>Setting a model for the Christian avatar and the archangel Gabriel
to follow, the luminous San-tusita (Bodhisat) appeared to Maha-maya
‘like a cloud in the moonlight, coming from the north, and in his hand
holding a white lotus.’ He announced to her the birth of her son, and
circumambulating the queen’s couch thrice ... passed away from the
dewa-loka and was conceived <em>in the world of</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>men</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1086" id="FNanchor_1086">[1086]</a></span>
 The resemblance
will be found still more perfect upon examining the illustrations in mediæval
 <span class="lock">psalters,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1087" id="FNanchor_1087">[1087]</a></span>
 and the panel-paintings of the sixteenth century (in the
Church of Jouy, for instance, in which the Virgin is represented kneeling,
with her hands uplifted toward the Holy Ghost, and the unborn child is
miraculously seen through her body), and then finding the same subject
treated in the identical way in the sculptures in certain convents in
Thibet. In the Pali-Buddhistic annals, and other religious records, it is
stated that Maha-devi and all her attendants were constantly gratified
with the sight of the infant Bodhisatva quietly developing within his
mother’s bosom, and beaming already, from his place of gestation, upon
humanity “the resplendent moonshine of his future
 <span class="lock">benevolence.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1088" id="FNanchor_1088">[1088]</a></span></p>

<p>Ananda, the cousin and future disciple of Sakya-muni, is represented
as having been born at the same time. He appears to have been the
original for the old legends about John the Baptist. For example, the
Pali narrative relates that Maha-maya, while pregnant with the sage,
paid a visit to his mother, as Mary did to the mother of the Baptist.
Immediately, as she entered the apartment, the unborn Ananda greeted
the unborn Buddha-Siddhârtha, who also returned the salutation; and in
like manner the babe, afterward John the Baptist, leaped in the womb of
Elizabeth when Mary came
 <span class="lock">in.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1089" id="FNanchor_1089">[1089]</a></span>
 More even than that; for Didron describes
a scene of salutation, painted on shutters at Lyons, between
Elizabeth and Mary, in which the two unborn infants, both pictured
as outside their mothers, are also saluting each
 <span class="lock">other.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1090" id="FNanchor_1090">[1090]</a></span></p>

<p>If we turn now to Christna and attentively compare the prophecies
respecting him, as collected in the Ramatsariarian traditions of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_556">556</a></span>
<i>Atharva</i>, the <i>Vedangas</i>, and the
 <span class="lock">Vedantas,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1091" id="FNanchor_1091">[1091]</a></span>
 with passages in the <cite>Bible</cite>

Let there be exaggeration or not in attributing to the <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>
and the other books such a great antiquity, the fact remains that <em>these
prophecies and their realization preceded Christianity</em>, and Christna
preceded Christ. That is all we need care to inquire.</p>

<p>One is completely overwhelmed with astonishment upon reading Dr.
Lundy’s <cite>Monumental Christianity</cite>. It would be difficult to say whether
an admiration for the author’s erudition, or amazement at his serene
and unparalleled sophistry is stronger. He has gathered a world of facts
which prove that the religions, far more ancient than Christianity, of
Christna, Buddha, and Osiris had anticipated even its minutest symbols.
His materials come from no forged papyri, no interpolated Gospels, but
from sculptures on the walls of ancient temples, from monuments, inscriptions,
and other archaic relics, only mutilated by the hammers of
iconoclasts, the cannon of fanatics, and the effects of time. He shows
us Christna and Apollo as good shepherds; Christna holding the cruciform
<i>chank</i> and the <i>chakra</i>, and Christna “crucified in space,” as he
calls it (<cite>Monumental Christianity</cite>, fig. 72). Of this figure—borrowed
by Dr. Lundy from Moor’s <cite>Hindu Pantheon</cite>—it may be truly said that
it is calculated to petrify a Christian with astonishment, for it is the
crucified Christ of Romish art to the last degree of resemblance. Not a
feature is lacking; and, the author says of it himself: “This representation
I believe to be anterior to Christianity.... It looks like a Christian
crucifix in many respects.... The drawing, the attitude, the nail-marks
in hands and feet, indicate a Christian origin, while the Parthian
coronet of seven points, the absence of the wood, and of the usual inscription,
and the rays of glory above, would seem to point to some other
than a Christian origin. Can it be the victim-man, or the priest and
victim both in one, of the Hindu Mythology, who offered himself a
sacrifice before the worlds were? Can it be Plato’s Second God who
impressed himself on the universe in the form of the cross? Or is it his
divine man who would be scourged, tormented, fettered; have his eyes
burnt out; and lastly ... <em>would be crucified</em>?” (<cite>Republic</cite>, <abbr title="chapter two">c. ii.</abbr>, p.
52, <abbr title="Spencer Translation"><cite>Spens. Trans.</cite></abbr>). It is all that and much more; <cite>Archaic Religious
Philosophy</cite> was universal.</p>

<p>As it is, Dr. Lundy contradicts Moor, and maintains that this figure
is that of <i>Wittoba</i>, one of the avatars of Vishnu, hence Christna, and
<em>anterior to Christianity</em>, which is a fact not very easily to be put down.
And yet although he finds it prophetic of Christianity, he thinks it has no
relation whatever to Christ! His only reason is that “in a Christian
crucifix the glory always comes from the sacred head; here it is from
above and beyond.... The Pundit’s Wittoba then, given to Moor,
would seem to be the crucified <i>Krishna</i>, the shepherd-god of Mathura

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_558">558</a></span>

... a <em>Saviour—the Lord of the Covenant, as well as Lord of Heaven and
earth—pure and impure, light and dark, good and bad, peaceful and war
like, amiable and wrathful, mild and turbulent, forgiving and vindictive,
God and a strange mixture of man</em>, but not the Christ of the Gospels.”</p>

<p>Now all these qualities must pertain to Jesus as well as to Christna.
The very fact that Jesus was a man upon the mother’s side—even though
he were a <em>God</em>, implies as much. His behavior toward the fig-tree, and
his self-contradictions, in <cite>Matthew</cite>, where at one time he promises peace
on earth, and at another the sword, etc., are proofs in this direction.
Undoubtedly this cut was never intended to represent Jesus of Nazareth.
It was Wittoba, as Moor was told, and as moreover the Hindu <cite>Sacred
Scriptures</cite> state, Brahma, the sacrificer who is “at once both sacrificer
and victim;” it is “Brahma, victim in His Son Christna, who came to
die on earth for our salvation, who Himself accomplishes the solemn
sacrifice (of the Sarvameda).” And yet, it is the man Jesus as well as
the man Christna, for both were united to their <i>Chrestos</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we have either to admit periodical “incarnations,” or let
Christianity go as the greatest imposture and plagiarism of the ages!</p>

<p>As to the Jewish <cite>Scriptures</cite>, only such men as the Jesuit de Carrière,
a convenient representative of the majority of the Catholic clergy, can
still command their followers to accept only the chronology established
by the Holy Ghost. It is on the authority of the latter that we learn
that Jacob went, with a family of seventy persons, all told, to settle in
Egypt in <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> 2298, and that in <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> 2513—just 215 years afterward—these
seventy persons had so increased that they left Egypt 600,000
fighting men strong, “without counting women and children,” which,
according to the science of statistics, should represent a total population
of between two and three millions!! Natural history affords no parallel
to such fecundity, except in red herrings. After this let the Christian
missionaries laugh, if they can, at Hindu chronology and computations.</p>

<p>“Happy are those persons, but not to be envied,” exclaims Bunsen,
“who have no misgivings about making Moses march out with more
than two millions of people at the end of a popular conspiracy and rising,
in the sunny days of the eighteenth dynasty; who make the Israelites
conquer Kanaan under Joshua, during and previous to the most formidable
campaigns of conquering Pharaohs in that same country. The Egyptian
and Assyrian annals, combined with the historical criticism of the
<cite>Bible</cite>, prove that the exodus could only have taken place under Menephthah,
so that Joshua could not have crossed the Jordan before Easter
1280, the last campaign of Ramses <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in Palestine being in
 <span class="lock">1281.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1092" id="FNanchor_1092">[1092]</a></span></p>

But we must resume the thread of our narrative with Buddha.</p>

<p>Neither he nor Jesus ever wrote one word of their doctrines. We
have to take the teachings of the masters on the testimony of the disciples,
and therefore it is but fair that we should be allowed to judge both
doctrines on their intrinsic value. Where the logical preponderance
lies, may be seen in the results of frequent encounters between Christian
missionaries and Buddhist theologians (<i>pungui</i>). The latter usually,
if not invariably, have the better of their opponents. On the other hand,
the “Lama of Jehovah” rarely fails to lose his temper, to the great delight
of the Lama of Buddha, and practically demonstrates his religion of patience,
mercy, and charity, by abusing his disputant in the most uncanonical
language. This we have witnessed repeatedly.</p>

<p>Despite the notable similarity of the direct teachings of Gautama and
Jesus, we yet find their respective followers starting from two diametrically
opposite points. The Buddhist divine, following literally the ethical
doctrine of his master, remains thus true to the legacy of Gautama;
while the Christian minister, distorting the precepts recorded by the four
<cite>Gospels</cite> beyond recognition, teaches, not that which Jesus taught, but
the absurd, too often pernicious, interpretations of fallible men—Popes,
Luthers, and Calvins included. The following are two instances selected
from both religions, and brought into contrast. Let the reader judge for
himself:</p>

<p>“Do not believe in anything because it is rumored and spoken of by
many,” says Buddha; “do not think that is a proof of its truth.</p>

<p>“Do not believe merely because the written statement of some old
sage is produced; do not be sure that the writing has ever been revised
by the said sage, or can be relied on. Do not believe in what you have
fancied, thinking that, <em>because an idea is extraordinary, it must have been
implanted by a Deva, or some wonderful being</em>.</p>

<p>“Do not believe in guesses, that is, assuming something at hap-hazard
as a starting-point, and then drawing conclusions from it—reckoning your
two and your three and your four <em>before you have fixed your number one</em>.</p>

<p>“<em>Do not believe merely on the authority of your teachers and masters</em>,
or believe and practice merely <em>because they believe and practice</em>.</p>

<p>“I [Buddha] tell you all, you must of yourselves know that this is
evil, this is punishable, this is censured by wise men; belief in this will
bring no advantage to any one, but will cause sorrow; and when you
know this, then eschew
 <span class="lock">it.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1093" id="FNanchor_1093">[1093]</a></span></p>

<p>It is impossible to avoid contrasting with these benevolent and human
sentiments, the fulminations of the Œcumenical Council and the Pope,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_560">560</a></span>
against the employment of reason, and the pursuit of science when it
clashes with revelation. The atrocious Papal benediction of Moslem arms
and cursing of the Russian and Bulgarian Christians have roused the indignation
of some of the most devoted Catholic communities. The Catholic
Czechs of Prague on the day of the recent semi-centennial jubilee of
Pius <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr>, and again on the 6th of July, the day sacred to the memory of
John Huss, the burned martyr, to mark their horror of the Ultramontane
policy in this respect, gathered by thousands upon the neighboring Mount
Zhishko, and with great ceremony and denunciations, burned the Pope’s
portrait, his Syllabus, and last allocution against the Russian Czar, saying
that they were good Catholics, but better Slavs. Evidently, the memory
of John Huss is more sacred to them than the Vatican Popes.</p>

<p>“The worship of words is more pernicious than the worship of
images,” remarks Robert Dale Owen. “Grammatolatry is the worst
species of idolatry. We have arrived at an era in which literalism is
destroying faith.... The letter
 <span class="lock">killeth.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1094" id="FNanchor_1094">[1094]</a></span></p>

<p>There is not a dogma in the Church to which these words can be
better applied than to the doctrine of
 <span class="lock"><i>transubstantiation</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1095" id="FNanchor_1095">[1095]</a></span>
 “Whoso
eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life,” Christ is made
to say. “This is a hard saying,” repeated his dismayed listeners. The
answer <em>was that of an initiate</em>. “Doth this offend you? It is the Spirit
that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing. The words (<i>remata</i>, or
arcane utterances) that I speak unto you, they are Spirit and they are
Life.”</p>

<p>During the Mysteries wine represented Bacchus, and bread
 <span class="lock">Ceres.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1096" id="FNanchor_1096">[1096]</a></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_561">561</a></span>

The hierophant-initiator presented symbolically before the final <em>revelation</em>
wine and bread to the candidate who had to eat and drink of both in
token that the spirit was to quicken matter, <i>i.e.</i>, the divine wisdom was
to enter into his body through what was to be revealed to him. Jesus, in
his Oriental phraseology, constantly assimilated himself to the true vine
(<cite>John</cite> <abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 1). Furthermore, the hierophant, the discloser of the Petroma,
was called “Father.” When Jesus says, “Drink ... this is my
blood,” what else was meant, it was simply a metaphorical assimilation
of himself to the vine, which bears the grape, whose juice is its blood—wine.
It was a hint that as he had himself been initiated by the
“Father,” so he desired to initiate others. His “Father” was the husbandman,
himself the vine, his disciples the branches. His followers
being ignorant of the terminology of the Mysteries, wondered; they even
took it as an offense, which is not surprising, considering the Mosaic injunction
against blood.</p>

<p>There is quite enough in the four gospels to show what was the
secret and most fervent hope of Jesus; the hope in which he began to
teach, and in which he died. In his immense and unselfish love for humanity,
he considers it unjust to deprive the many of the results of the
knowledge acquired by the few. This result he accordingly preaches—the
unity of a spiritual God, whose temple is within each of us, and in whom
we live as He lives in us—in spirit. This knowledge was in the hands
of the Jewish adepts of the school of Hillel and the kabalists. But the
“scribes,” or lawyers, having gradually merged into the dogmatism of
the dead letter, had long since separated themselves from the Tanaïm,
the true spiritual teachers; and the practical kabalists were more or less
persecuted by the Synagogue. Hence, we find Jesus exclaiming: “Woe
unto you lawyers! <cite>For ye have taken away the key of knowledge</cite> [the Gnosis]:
ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering ye prevented”
(<cite>Luke</cite> <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr> 52). The meaning here is clear. They did take the
key away, and could not even profit by it themselves, for the <i>Masorah</i>
(tradition) had become a closed book to themselves as well as to others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_562">562</a></span>

Neither Renan nor Strauss, nor the more modern Viscount Amberley
seem to have had the remotest suspicion of the real meaning of many of
the parables of Jesus, or even of the character of the great Galilean philosopher.
Renan, as we have seen, presented him to us as a Gallicized
Rabbi, “<i lang="fr">le plus charmant de tous</i>,” still but a Rabbi; and one, moreover,
who does not even come out of the school of Hillel, or any school
either, albeit he terms him repeatedly “the charming
 <span class="lock">doctor.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1097" id="FNanchor_1097">[1097]</a></span>
 He
shows him as a sentimental young enthusiast, sprung out of the plebeian
classes of Galilee, who imagines the ideal kings of his parables the empurpled
and jewelled beings of whom one reads in nursery
 <span class="lock">tales.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1098" id="FNanchor_1098">[1098]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord Amberley’s Jesus, on the other hand, is an “iconoclastic idealist,”
far inferior in subtilty and logic to his critics. Renan looks over at
Jesus with the one-sidedness of a Semitomaniac; Viscount Amberley
looks down upon him from the social plane of an English lord. <i lang="la">Apropos</i>
of this marriage-feast parable, which he considers as embodying “a curious
theory of social intercourse,” the Viscount says: “Nobody can
object to charitable individuals asking poor people or invalids <em>without
rank</em> at their houses.... But we cannot admit that this kind action
ought to be rendered obligatory ... it is eminently desirable that we
should do exactly what Christ would forbid us doing—namely, invite our
neighbors and be invited by them as circumstances may require. The
fear that we may receive a recompense for the dinner-parties we may
give, is surely chimerical.... Jesus, in fact, overlooks entirely the
more intellectual side of
 <span class="lock">society.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1099" id="FNanchor_1099">[1099]</a></span>
 All of which unquestionably shows
that the “Son of God” was no master of social etiquette, nor fit for
“society;” but it is also a fair example of the prevalent misconception
of even his most suggestive parables.</p>

<p>The theory of Anquetil du Perron that the <cite>Bagaved-gita</cite> is an independent
work, as it is absent from several manuscripts of the <cite>Mahâ-Bhârata</cite>,
may be as much a plea for a still greater antiquity as the reverse.
The work is purely metaphysical and ethical, and in a certain sense it is
<em>anti-Vedic</em>; so far, at least, that it is in opposition with many of the
later Brahmanical interpretations of the <cite>Vedas</cite>. How comes it, then,
that instead of destroying the work, or, at least, of sentencing it as uncanonical—an
expedient to which the Christian Church would never have
failed to resort—the Brahmans show it the greatest reverence? Perfectly
<em>unitarian</em> in its aim, it clashes with the popular idol-worship.
Still, the only precaution taken by the Brahmans to keep its tenets from
becoming too well known, is to preserve it more secretly than any other

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_563">563</a></span>

religious book from every caste except the sacerdotal; and, to impose
upon that even, in many cases, certain restrictions. The grandest mysteries
of the Brahmanical religion are embraced within this magnificent
poem; and even the Buddhists recognize it, explaining certain dogmatic
difficulties in their own way. “Be unselfish, subdue your senses
and passions, which obscure reason and lead to deceit,” says Christna to
his disciple Arjuna, thus enunciating a purely Buddhistic principle.
“Low men follow examples, great men give them.... The soul ought
to free itself from the bonds of action, and act absolutely according to
its divine origin. <em>There is but one God</em>, and all other devotas are inferior,
and mere forms (powers) of Brahma or of myself. <em>Worship by
deeds predominates over that of</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>contemplation.</em>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1100" id="FNanchor_1100">[1100]</a></span></p>

<p>This doctrine coincides perfectly with that of Jesus
 <span class="lock">himself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1101" id="FNanchor_1101">[1101]</a></span>
 Faith
alone, unaccompanied by “works,” is reduced to naught in the <cite>Bagaved-gita</cite>.
As to the <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite>, it was and is preserved in such secrecy
by the Brahmans, that it is a matter of doubt whether the Orientalists
have a <em>complete</em> copy of it. One who has read what Abbé Dubois
says may well doubt the fact. “Of the last species—the Atharva—there
are very few,” he says, writing of the <cite>Vedas</cite>, “and many people
suppose they no longer exist. But the truth is, they do exist, though
they conceal themselves with more caution than the others, from the
fear of being suspected to be initiated in the magic mysteries and other
dreaded mysteries which the work is believed to
 <span class="lock">teach.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1102" id="FNanchor_1102">[1102]</a></span></p>

<p>There were even those among the highest <i>epoptæ</i> of the greater
<i>Mysteries</i> who knew nothing of their last and dreaded rite—the voluntary
transfer of life from hierophant to candidate. In
 <span class="lock"><cite>Ghost-Land</cite><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1103" id="FNanchor_1103">[1103]</a></span>
 this
mystical operation of the adept’s transfer of his spiritual entity, after the
death of his body, into the youth he loves with all the ardent love of a
spiritual parent, is superbly described. As in the case of the reïncarnation
of the lamas of Thibet, an adept of the highest order may live indefinitely.
His mortal casket wears out notwithstanding certain alchemical
secrets for prolonging the youthful vigor far beyond the usual limits,
yet the body can rarely be kept alive beyond ten or twelve score of years.
The old garment is then worn out, and the spiritual Ego forced to leave
it, selects for its habitation a new body, fresh and full of healthy vital
principle. In case the reader should feel inclined to ridicule this assertion

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_564">564</a></span>

of the possible prolongation of human life, we may as well refer him
to the statistics of several countries. The author of an able article in the
<cite>Westminster Review</cite>, for October, 1850, is responsible for the statement that
in England, they have the authentic instances of one Thomas Jenkins dying
at the age of 169, and “Old Parr” at 152; and that in Russia some of
the peasants are “known to have reached 242
 <span class="lock">years.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1104" id="FNanchor_1104">[1104]</a></span>
 There are also
cases of centenarianism reported among the Peruvian Indians. We are
aware that many able writers have recently discredited these claims to an
extreme longevity, but we nevertheless affirm our belief in their truth.</p>

<p>True or false there are “superstitions” among the Eastern people such
as have never been dreamed even by an Edgar Poe or a Hoffmann. And
these beliefs run in the very blood of the nations with which they originated.
Carefully stripped of exaggeration they will be found to embody
an universal belief in those restless, wandering, astral souls, which are
called ghouls and vampires. An Armenian Bishop of the fifth century,
named Yeznik, gives a number of such narratives in a manuscript work
(Book <abbr title="one, sections">i., §§</abbr> 20, 30), preserved some thirty years ago in the library of the
Monastery of
 <span class="lock">Etchmeadzine.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1105" id="FNanchor_1105">[1105]</a></span>
 Among others, there is a tradition dating
from the days of heathendom, that whenever a hero whose life is needed
yet on earth falls on the battle-field, the Aralez, the popular gods of ancient
Armenia, empowered to bring back to life those slaughtered in
battle, lick the bleeding wounds of the victim, and breathe on them until
they have imparted a new and vigorous life. After that the warrior rises,
washes off all traces of his wounds, and resumes his place in the fray. But
his immortal spirit has fled; and for the remainder of his days he lives—a
deserted temple.</p>

<p>Once that an adept was initiated into the last and most solemn mystery
of the life-transfer, the awful <em>seventh</em> rite of the great sacerdotal
operation, which is the highest theurgy, he belonged no more to this
world. His soul was free thereafter, and the <em>seven</em> mortal sins lying in
wait to devour his heart, as the soul, liberated by death, would be crossing
the <em>seven</em> halls and <em>seven</em> staircases, could hurt him no more alive or
dead; he has passed the “twice seven trials,” the <em>twelve</em> labors of the
final
 <span class="lock">hour.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1106" id="FNanchor_1106">[1106]</a></span></p>

<p>The High Hierophant alone knew how to perform this solemn operation

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_565">565</a></span>
by infusing his own vital life and astral soul into the adept, chosen
by him for his successor, who thus became endowed with a double
 <span class="lock">life.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1107" id="FNanchor_1107">[1107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man <em>be born again</em>, he cannot
see the kingdom of God” (<cite>John</cite> <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr> 3). Jesus tells Nicodemus,
“That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the
spirit is spirit.”</p>

<p>This allusion, so unintelligible in itself, is explained in the <cite>Satapa-Brâhmana</cite>.
It teaches that a man striving after spiritual perfection
must have <em>three</em> births: 1st. Physical from his mortal parents; <abbr title="Second">2d</abbr>. <em>Spiritual</em>,
through religious sacrifice (initiation); 3d. His final birth into the
world of spirit—at death. Though it may seem strange that we should
have to go to the old land of the Punjâb and the banks of the sacred
Ganges, for an interpreter of words spoken in Jerusalem and expounded
on the banks of the Jordan, the fact is evident. This second birth, or
regeneration of spirit, after the natural birth of that which is born of the
flesh, might have astonished a Jewish ruler. Nevertheless, it had been
taught 3,000 years before the appearance of the great Galilean
prophet, not only in old India but to all the <i>epoptæ</i> of the Pagan initiation,
who were instructed in the great mysteries of <span class="smcap">Life</span> and <span class="smcap">Death</span>.
This secret of secrets, that <em>soul</em> is not knit to flesh, was practically demonstrated
in the instance of the Yogis, the followers of Kapila. Having
emancipated their souls from the fetters of <i>Prakriti</i>, or <i>Mahat</i> (the
physical perception of the senses and mind—in one sense, creation),
they so developed their soul-power and <em>will-force</em>, as to have actually
enabled themselves, while on earth, to communicate with the supernal
worlds, and perform what is bunglingly termed
 <span class="lock">“miracles.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1108" id="FNanchor_1108">[1108]</a></span>
 Men

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_566">566</a></span>
whose astral spirits have attained on earth the <i>nehreyasa</i>, or the <i>mukti</i>,
are half-gods; disembodied spirits, they reach Moksha or <i>Nirvana</i>,
and this is their <em>second</em> spiritual birth.</p>

<p>Buddha teaches the doctrine of a new birth as plainly as Jesus does.
Desiring to break with the ancient Mysteries, to which it was impossible
to admit the ignorant masses, the Hindu reformer, though generally
silent upon more than one secret dogma, clearly states his thought in several
passages. Thus, he says: “<cite>Some people are born again</cite>; evil-doers
go to Hell; righteous people go to Heaven; those who are free from all
worldly desires enter Nirvana” (<cite>Precepts of the Dhammapada</cite>, v., 126).
Elsewhere Buddha states that “it is better to believe in a future life, in
which happiness or misery can be felt; for if the heart believes therein,
it will abandon sin and act virtuously; and even if there is no resurrection,
such a life will bring a good name and the regard of men. <em>But those
who believe in extinction at death will not fail to commit any sin</em> that they
may choose, because of their disbelief in a
 <span class="lock">future.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1109" id="FNanchor_1109">[1109]</a></span></p>

<p>The <cite>Epistle to the Hebrews</cite> treats of the sacrifice of blood. “Where
a testament is,” says the writer, “there must be of necessity <em>the death</em> of
the testator.... Without the shedding <em>of blood</em> is no remission.” Then
again: “Christ glorified not himself to <em>be made High Priest</em>; but He
that said unto him: Thou art my son; <span class="smcap">to-day have I begotten thee</span>”
(<abbr title="Hebrews five"><cite>Heb.</cite> v.</abbr> 5). This is a very clear inference, that, 1, Jesus was considered
only in the light of a high priest, like Melchisedek—another <i>avatar</i>, or incarnation
of Christ, according to the Fathers; and, 2, that the writer thought
that Jesus had become a “Son of God” only at the moment of his initiation
by water; hence, that he was not born a god, neither was he begotten
physically by Him. Every initiate of the “last hour” became, by the
very fact of his initiation, a son of God. When Maxime, the Ephesian,
initiated the Emperor Julian into the Mithraïc Mysteries, he pronounced
as the usual formula of the rite, the following: “By this blood, I wash
thee from thy sins. The Word of the Highest has entered unto thee, and
His Spirit henceforth will rest upon the <span class="allsmcap">NEWLY-BORN</span>, <em>the now</em>-begotten
of the Highest God.... Thou art the son of Mithra.” “Thou art the
‘<em>Son of God</em>,’” repeated the disciples after Christ’s baptism. When Paul
shook off the viper into the fire without further injury to himself, the people
of Melita said “that he was <em>a god</em>” (<cite>Acts</cite> <abbr title="twenty-eight">xxviii.</abbr>). “He is the son
of God, the Beautiful!” was the term used by the disciples of Simon

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_567">567</a></span>
Magus, for they thought they recognized the “great power of God” in
him.</p>

<p>A man can have no god that is not bounded by his own human conceptions.
The wider the sweep of his spiritual vision, the mightier will
be his deity. But where can we find a better demonstration of Him than
in man himself; in the spiritual and divine powers lying dormant in
every human being? “The very capacity to imagine the possibility of
thaumaturgical powers, is itself evidence that they exist,” says the author
of <cite>Prophecy</cite>. “The critic, as well as the skeptic, is generally inferior
to the person or subject that he is reviewing, and, therefore, is hardly a
competent witness. <em>If there are counterfeits, somewhere there must have
been a genuine</em>
 <span class="lock">original.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1110" id="FNanchor_1110">[1110]</a></span></p>

<p>Blood begets phantoms, and its emanations furnish certain spirits with
the materials required to fashion their temporary appearances. “Blood,”
says Levi, “is the first incarnation of the universal fluid; it is the materialized
<em>vital light</em>. Its birth is the most marvellous of all nature’s marvels;
it lives only by perpetually transforming itself, for it is the universal
Proteus. The blood issues from principles where there was none of it
before, and it becomes flesh, bones, hair, nails ... tears, and perspiration.
It can be allied neither to corruption nor death; when life is gone,
it begins decomposing; if you know how to reänimate it, to infuse
into it life by a new magnetization of its globules, life will return to it
again. The universal substance, with its double motion, is the great
arcanum of being; blood is the great arcanum of life.”</p>

<p>“Blood,” says the Hindu Ramatsariar, “contains all the mysterious
secrets of existence, no living being can exist without. It is profaning
the great work of the Creator to eat blood.”</p>

<p>In his turn Moses, following the universal and traditional law, forbids
eating blood.</p>

<p>Paracelsus writes that with the fumes of blood one is enabled to call
forth any spirit we desire to see; for with its emanations it will build itself
an appearance, a <em>visible</em> body—only this is sorcery. The hierophants
of Baal made deep incisions all over their bodies and produced
apparitions, objective and tangible, with their own blood. The followers
of a certain sect in Persia, many of whom may be found around the Russian
settlements in Temerchan-Shoura, and Derbent, have their religious
mysteries in which they form a large ring, and whirl round in a frantic
dance. Their temples are ruined, and they worship in large temporary
buildings, securely enclosed, and with the earthen floor deeply strewn with
sand. They are all dressed in long white robes, and their heads are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_568">568</a></span>
bare and closely shaved. Armed with knives, they soon reach a point
of furious exaltation, and wound themselves and others until their garments
and the sand on the floor are soaked with blood. Before the
end of the “Mystery” <em>every man has a companion</em>, who whirls round
with him. Sometimes the spectral dancers have <em>hair on their heads</em>, which
makes them quite distinct from their unconscious creators. As we have
solemnly promised never to divulge the principal details of this terrible
ceremony (which we were allowed to witness but once), we must leave
the <span class="lock">subject.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1111" id="FNanchor_1111">[1111]</a></span></p>

<p>In the days of antiquity the sorceresses of Thessaly added sometimes
to the blood of a black lamb that of an infant, and by this means evoked
the shadows. The priests were taught the art of calling up the spirits
of the dead, as well as those of the elements, but their mode was certainly
not that of Thessalian sorceresses.</p>

<p>Among the Yakuts of Siberia there is a tribe dwelling on the very
confines of the Transbaïkal regions near the river Vitema (eastern
Siberia) which practices sorcery as known in the days of the Thessalian
witches. Their religious beliefs are curious as a mixture of philosophy
and superstition. They have a chief or supreme god Aij-Taïon, who did
not create, they say, but only <em>presides</em> over the creation of all the worlds.
He lives on the <em>ninth</em> heaven, and it is but from the <em>seventh</em> that the
other minor gods—his servants—can manifest themselves to their creatures.
This ninth heaven, according to the revelation of the minor
deities (spirits, we suppose), has three suns and three moons, and the
ground of this abode is formed of four lakes (the four cardinal points) of
“soft air” (ether), instead of water. While they offer no sacrifices to the
Supreme Deity, for he needs none, they do try to propitiate both the
good and bad deities, which they respectively term the “white” and the
“black” gods. They do it, because neither of the two classes are good
or bad through personal merit or demerit. As they are all subject to
the Supreme Aij-Taïon, and each has to carry on the duty assigned to
him from eternity, they are not responsible for either the good or evil
they produce in this world. The reason given by the Yakuts for
such sacrifices is very curious. Sacrifices, they say, help each class of
gods to perform their mission the better, and so please the Supreme;
and every mortal that helps either of them in performing his duty must,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_569">569</a></span>
therefore, please the Supreme as well, for he will have helped justice to
take place. As the “black” gods are appointed to bring diseases, evils,
and all kinds of calamities to mankind, each of which is a punishment
for some transgression, the Yakuts offer to them “bloody” sacrifices of
animals; while to the “white” they make pure offerings, consisting generally
of an animal consecrated to some special god and taken care of
with great ceremony, as having become sacred. According to their
ideas the souls of the dead become “shadows,” and are doomed to wander
on earth, till a certain change takes place either for the better or
worse, which the Yakuts do not pretend to explain. The <em>light</em>
shadows, <i>i.e.</i>, those of good people, become the guardians and protectors
of those they loved on earth; the “dark” shadows (the wicked) always
seek, on the contrary, to hurt those they knew, by inciting them to crimes,
wicked acts, and otherwise injuring mortals. Besides these, like the
ancient Chaldees, they reckon seven divine <i>Sheitans</i> (dæmons) or minor
gods. It is during the sacrifices of blood, which take place at night, that
the Yakuts call forth the wicked or <em>dark</em> shadows, to inquire of them
what they can do to arrest their mischief; hence, <em>blood is necessary</em>,
for without its fumes the ghosts could not make themselves clearly visible,
and would become, according to their ideas, but the more dangerous,
for they would suck it from living persons by their perspiration.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1112" id="FNanchor_1112">[1112]</a>
As to the good, <em>light</em> shadows, they need not be called out; besides that,
such an act disturbs them; they can make their presence felt, when
needed, without any preparation and ceremonies.</p>

<p>The blood-evocation is also practiced, although with a different purpose,
in several parts of Bulgaria and Moldavia, especially in districts in
the vicinity of Mussulmans. The fearful oppressions and slavery to
which these unfortunate Christians have been subjected for centuries has
rendered them a thousand-fold more impressible, and at the same time
more superstitious, than those who live in civilized countries. On every
seventh of May the inhabitants of every Moldavo-Valachian and Bulgarian
city or village, have what they term the “feast of the dead.”
After sunset, immense crowds of women and men, each with a lighted
wax taper in hand, resort to the burial places, and pray on the tombs of
their departed friends. This ancient and solemn ceremony, called
<i>Trizna</i>, is everywhere a reminiscence of primitive Christian rites, but
far more solemn yet, while in Mussulman slavery. Every tomb is furnished
with a kind of cupboard, about half a yard high, built of four
stones, and with hinged double-doors. These closets contain what is
termed the household of the defunct: namely, a few wax tapers, some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_570">570</a></span>
oil and an earthen lamp, which is lighted on that day, and burns for
twenty-four hours. Wealthy people have silver lamps richly chiselled,
and bejewelled images, which are secure from thieves, for in the burial
ground the closets are even left open. Such is the dread of the population
(Mussulman and Christian) of the revenge of the dead that a
thief bold enough to commit any murder, would never dare touch the
property of a dead person. The Bulgarians have a belief that every
Saturday, and especially the eve of Easter Sunday, and until Trinity
day (about seven weeks) the souls of the dead descend on earth, some
to beg forgiveness from those living whom they had wronged; others to
protect and commune with their loved ones. Faithfully following the
traditional rites of their forefathers, the natives on each Saturday of
these seven weeks keep either lamps or tapers lighted. In addition to
that, on the <em>seventh</em> of May they drench the tombs with grape wine, and
burn incense around them from sunset to sunrise. With the inhabitants
of towns, the ceremony is limited to these simple observances. With
some of the rustics though, the rite assumes the proportions of a theurgic
evocation. On the eve of Ascension Day, Bulgarian women light a
quantity of tapers and lamps; the pots are placed upon tripods, and
incense perfumes the atmosphere for miles around; while thick white
clouds of smoke envelope each tomb, as though a veil had separated it
from the others. During the evening, and until a little before midnight,
in memory of the deceased, acquaintances and a certain number of
mendicants are fed and treated with wine and <i>raki</i> (grape-whiskey), and
money is distributed among the poor according to the means of the surviving
relatives. When the feast is ended, the guests approaching the
tomb and addressing the defunct by name, thank him or her for the
bounties received. When all but the nearest relatives are gone, a
woman, usually the most aged, remains alone with the dead, and—some
say—resorts to the ceremony of invocation.</p>

<p>After fervent prayers, repeated face downward on the grave-mound,
more or less drops of blood are drawn from near the left bosom, and
allowed to trickle upon the tomb. This gives strength to the invisible
spirit which hovers around, to assume for a few instants a visible form,
and whisper his instructions to the Christian theurgist—if he has any to
offer, or simply to “bless the mourner” and then disappear again till
the following year. So firmly rooted is this belief that we have heard,
in a case of family difficulty, a Moldavian woman appeal to her sister
to put off every decision till Ascension-night, when their dead father
<em>would be able to tell them of his will and pleasure in person</em>; to which
the sister consented as simply as though their parent were in the next
room.</p>

That there are fearful secrets in nature may well be believed when,
as we have seen in the case of the Russian <i>Znachar</i>, the sorcerer <em>cannot</em>
die until he has passed the word to another, and the hierophants of
White Magic rarely do. It seems as if the dread power of the “Word”
could only be entrusted to one man of a certain district or body of
people at a time. When the Brahmâtma was about to lay aside the
burden of physical existence, he imparted his secret to his successor,
either orally, or by a writing placed in a securely-fastened casket which
went into the latter’s hands alone. Moses “lays his hands” upon his
neophyte, Joshua, in the solitudes of Nebo and passes away forever.
Aaron initiates Eleazar on Mount Hor, and dies. Siddhârtha-Buddha
promises his mendicants before his death to live in him who shall deserve
it, embraces his favorite disciple, whispers in his ear, and dies; and as
John’s head lies upon the bosom of Jesus, he is told that he shall
“tarry” until he shall come. Like signal-fires of the olden times,
which, lighted and extinguished by turns upon one hill-top after another,
conveyed intelligence along a whole stretch of country, so we see a long
line of “wise” men from the beginning of history down to our own
times communicating the word of wisdom to their direct successors.
Passing from seer to seer, the “Word” flashes out like lightning, and
while carrying off the initiator from human sight forever, brings the new
initiate into view. Meanwhile, whole nations murder each other in the
name of another “Word,” an empty substitute accepted literally by
each, and misinterpreted by all!</p>

<p>We have met few sects which truly practice sorcery. One such is
the Yezidis, considered by some a branch of the Koords, though we believe
erroneously. These inhabit chiefly the mountainous and desolate
regions of Asiatic Turkey, about Mosul, Armenia, and are found even in
 <span class="lock">Syria,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1113" id="FNanchor_1113">[1113]</a></span>
 and Mesopotamia. They are called and known everywhere as
devil-worshippers; and most certainly it is not either through ignorance or
mental obscuration that they have set up the worship and a regular intercommunication
with the lowest and the most malicious of both elementals
and elementaries. They recognize the present wickedness of the chief of
the “black powers;” but at the same time they dread his power, and so try

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_572">572</a></span>
to conciliate to themselves his favors. He is in an open quarrel with
Allah, they say, but a reconciliation can take place between the two at
any day; and those who have shown marks of their disrespect to the
“black one” now, may suffer for it at some future time, and thus have
both God and Devil against them. This is simply a cunning policy that
seeks to propitiate his Satanic majesty, who is no other than the great
<i>Tcherno-bog</i> (the black god) of the Variagi-Russ, the ancient idolatrous
Russians before the days of Vladimir.</p>

<p>Like Wierus, the famous demonographer of the sixteenth century
(who in his <i>Pseudomonarchia Dæmonum</i> describes and enumerates a regular
infernal court, which has its dignitaries, princes, dukes, nobles, and
officers), the Yezidis have a whole pantheon of devils, and use the Jakshas,
aërial spirits, to convey their prayers and respects to Satan their master,
and the Afrites of the Desert. During their prayer-meetings, they join
hands, and form immense rings, with their Sheik, or an officiating priest
in the middle who claps his hands, and intones every verse in honor of
Sheitan (Satan). Then they whirl and leap in the air. When the frenzy
is at its climax, they often wound and cut themselves with their daggers,
occasionally rendering the same service to their next neighbors. But
their wounds do not heal and cicatrize as easily as in the case of lamas
and holy men; for but too often they fall victims to these self-inflicted
wounds. While dancing and flourishing high their daggers without unclasping
hands—for this would be considered a sacrilege, and the spell
instantly broken, they coax and praise Sheitan, and entreat him to manifest
himself in his works by “miracles.” As their rites are chiefly accomplished
during night, they do not fail to obtain manifestations of various
character, the least of which are enormous globes of fire which take the
shapes of the most uncouth animals.</p>

<p>Lady Hester Stanhope, whose name was for many years a power among
the masonic fraternities of the East, is said to have witnessed, personally,
several of these Yezidean ceremonies. We were told by an <i>Ockhal</i>, of
the sect of Druses, that after having been present at one of the Yezidis’
“Devil’s masses,” as they are called, this extraordinary lady, so noted for
personal courage and daring bravery, fainted, and notwithstanding her
usual Emir’s male attire, was recalled to life and health with the greatest
difficulty. Personally, we regret to say, all our efforts to witness one of
these performances failed.</p>

<p>A recent article in a Catholic journal on Nagualism and Voodooism
charges Hayti with being the centre of secret societies, with terrible forms
of initiation and bloody rites, where <em>human infants are sacrificed and
devoured by the adepts</em>(!!) Piron, a French traveller, is quoted at
length, describing a most fearful scene witnessed by him in Cuba, in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_573">573</a></span>
house of a lady whom he never would have suspected of any connection
with so monstrous a sect. “A naked white girl acted as a voodoo
priestess, wrought up to frenzy by dances and incantations that followed the
sacrifice of a white and a black hen. A serpent, trained to its part, and
acted on by the music, coiled round the limbs of the girl, its motions
studied by the votaries dancing around or standing to watch its contortions.
The spectator fled at last in horror when the poor girl fell writhing in an
epileptic fit.”</p>

<p>While deploring such a state of things in Christian countries, the
Catholic article in question explains this tenacity for ancestral religious
rites as evidence of the <em>natural depravity of the human heart</em>, and
makes a loud call for greater zeal on the part of Catholics. Besides repeating
the absurd fiction about devouring children, the writer seems
wholly insensible to the fact that a devotion to one’s faith that centuries
of the most cruel and bloody persecution cannot quench, makes heroes
and martyrs of a people, whereas their conversion to any other faith
would turn them simply into renegades. A compulsory religion can
never breed anything but deceit. The answer received by the missionary
Margil from some Indians supports the above truism. The question
being: “How is it that you are so heathenish after having been Christians
so long?” The answer was: “What would you do, father, if enemies
of your faith entered your land? Would you not take all your
books and vestments and signs of religion and retire to the most secret
caves and mountains? This is just what our priests, and prophets,
and soothsayers, and nagualists have done to this time and are still
doing.”</p>

<p>Such an answer from a Roman Catholic, questioned by a missionary
of either Greek or Protestant Church, would earn for him the crown of a
saint in the Popish martyrology. Better a “heathen” religion that can
extort from a Francis Xavier such a tribute as he pays the Japanese, in
saying that “in virtue and probity they surpassed all the nations he had
ever seen;” than a Christianity whose advance over the face of the earth
sweeps aboriginal nations out of existence as with a hurricane of fire.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1114" id="FNanchor_1114">[1114]</a>
Disease, drunkenness, and demoralization are the immediate results of
apostasy from the faith of their fathers, and conversion into a religion of
mere forms.</p>

<p>What Christianity is doing for British India, we need go to no inimical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_574">574</a></span>
sources to inquire. Captain O’Grady, the British ex-official, says:
“The British government is doing a shameful thing in turning the
natives of India from a sober race to a nation of drunkards. And
for pure <em>greed</em>. Drinking is forbidden by the religion alike of Hindus
and Mussulmans. But ... drinking is daily becoming more and more
prevalent.... What the accursed opium traffic, forced on China by
British greed, has been to that unhappy country, the government
sale of liquor is likely to become to India. For it is a government
monopoly, based on almost precisely the same model as the government
monopoly of tobacco in Spain.... The outside domestics in
European families usually get to be terrible drunkards.... The indoor
servants usually detest drinking, and are a good deal more respectable
in this particular than their masters and mistresses ... everybody
drinks ... bishops, chaplains, freshly-imported boarding-school girls,
and all.”</p>

<p>Yes, these are the “blessings” that the modern Christian religion
brings with its <i>Bibles</i> and <i>Catechisms</i> to the “poor heathen.” Rum and
bastardy to Hindustan; opium to China; rum and foul disorders to
Tahiti; and, worst of all, the example of hypocrisy in religion, and a
practical skepticism and atheism, which, since it seems to be good enough
for <em>civilized</em> people, may well in time be thought good enough for those
whom theology has too often been holding under a very heavy yoke. On
the other hand, everything that is noble, spiritual, elevating, in the old
religion is denied, and even deliberately falsified.</p>

<p>Take Paul, read the little of original that is left of him in the writings
attributed to this brave, honest, sincere man, and see whether any one
can find a word therein to show that Paul meant by the word Christ anything
more than the abstract ideal of the personal divinity indwelling in
man. For Paul, Christ is not a person, but an embodied idea. “If any
man is in Christ he is a new creation,” <em>he is reborn</em>, as after initiation,
for the Lord is spirit—the spirit of man. Paul was the only one of the
apostles who had understood the secret ideas underlying the teachings of
Jesus, although he had never met him. But Paul had been initiated
himself; and, bent upon inaugurating a new and broad reform, one
embracing the whole of humanity, he sincerely set his own doctrines far
above the wisdom of the ages, above the ancient Mysteries and final
revelation to the epoptæ. As Professor A. Wilder well proves in a series
of able articles, it <em>was not Jesus, but Paul who was the real founder of
Christianity</em>. “The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch,”
say the <cite>Acts of the Apostles</cite>. “Such men as Irenæus, Epiphanius, and
Eusebius have transmitted to posterity a reputation for untruth and dishonest
practices; and the heart sickens at the story of the crimes of that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_575">575</a></span>
period,” writes this author, in a recent article.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1115" id="FNanchor_1115">[1115]</a> “It will be remembered,”
he adds, “that when the Moslems overran Syria and Asia Minor for the
first time, they were welcomed by the Christians of those regions as
deliverers from the intolerable oppression of the ruling authorities of the
Church.”</p>

<p>Mahomet never was, neither is he now, considered a god; yet under
the stimulus of his name millions of Moslems have served their God with
an ardor that can never be paralleled by Christian sectarianism. That
they have sadly degenerated since the days of their prophet, does not
alter the case in hand, but only proves the more the prevalence of matter
over spirit all over the world. Besides, they have never degenerated
more from primitive faith than Christians themselves. Why, then, should
not Jesus of Nazareth, a thousandfold higher, nobler, and morally grander
than Mahomet, be as well revered by Christians and followed in practice,
instead of being blindly adored in fruitless faith as a god, and at the same
time worshipped much after the fashion of certain Buddhists, who turn
their wheel of prayers. That this faith has become sterile, and is no
more worthy the name of Christianity than the fetishism of Calmucks
that of the philosophy preached by Buddha, is doubted by none. “We
would not be supposed to entertain the opinion,” says Dr. Wilder, “that
modern Christianity is in any degree identical with the religion preached
by Paul. It lacks his breadth of view, his earnestness, his keen spiritual
perception. Bearing the impress of the nations by which it is professed,
it exhibits as many forms as there are races. It is one thing in Italy and
Spain, but widely differs in France, Germany, Holland, Sweden, Great
Britain, Russia, Armenia, Kurdistan, and Abyssinia. As compared with
the preceding worships, the change seems to be more in name than in
genius. Men had gone to bed Pagans and awoke Christians. As for the
<cite>Sermon on the Mount</cite>, its conspicuous doctrines are more or less repudiated
by every Christian community of any considerable dimensions. Barbarism,
oppression, cruel punishments, are as common now as in the
days of Paganism.</p>

<p>“The Christianity of Peter exists no more; that of Paul supplanted it,
and was in its turn amalgamated with the other world religions. When
mankind are enlightened, or the barbarous races and families are supplanted
by those of nobler nature and instincts, the ideal excellencies may
become realities.</p>

<p>“The ‘Christ of Paul’ has constituted an enigma which evoked the
most strenuous endeavor to solve. He was something else than the Jesus
of the <cite>Gospels</cite>. Paul disregarded utterly their ‘endless genealogies.’ The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_576">576</a></span>
author of the fourth <cite>Gospel</cite>, himself an Alexandrian Gnostic, describes
Jesus as what would now be termed a ‘materialized’ divine spirit. He
was the Logos, or First Emanation—the Metathron.... The ‘mother
of Jesus,’ like the Princess Maya, Danaé, or perhaps Periktioné, had
given birth, not to a love-child, but to a divine offspring. No Jew of
whatever sect, no apostle, no early believer, ever promulgated such an
idea. Paul treats of Christ as a personage rather than as a person. The
sacred lessons of the secret assemblies often personified the divine good
and the divine truth in a human form, assailed by the passions and appetites
of mankind, but superior to them; and this doctrine, emerging from
the crypt, was apprehended by churchlings and gross-minded men as that
of immaculate conception and divine incarnation.”</p>

<p>In the old book, published in 1693 and written by the Sieur de la
Loubère, French Ambassador to the King of Siam, are related many interesting
facts of the Siamese religion. The remarks of the satirical
Frenchman are so pointed that we will quote his words about the Siamese
Saviour—Sommona-Cadom.</p>

<p>“How marvellous soever they pretend the birth of their Saviour has
been, they cease not to give <em>him a father and a</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>mother</em>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1116" id="FNanchor_1116">[1116]</a></span>
 His mother,
whose name is found in some of their <i>Balie</i> (Pali?) books, was called, as
they say, <i>Maha</i> <span class="smcap">Maria</span>, which seems to signify the great Mary, for Maha
signifies great. However it be, this ceases not to give attention to the
missionaries, and has perhaps given occasion to the Siamese to believe
that Jesus being the son of <i>Mary</i>, was brother to Sommona-Cadom, and
that, having been crucified, he was that <em>wicked</em> brother whom they give
to Sommona-Cadom, under the name of Thevetat, and whom they report
to be punished in Hell, with a punishment which participates something
of a cross.... The Siamese expect another Sommona-Cadom, I mean,
another miraculous man like him, whom they already named <i>Pronarote</i>,
and whom they say was foretold by Sommona. He made all sorts of
miracles.... He had two disciples, both standing on each hand of his
idol; one on the right hand, and the other on the left ... the first is
named Pra-Magla, and the second <i>Pra Scaribout</i>.... The father of
Sommona-Cadom was, according to this same <i>Balie</i> Book, a King of
Teve Lanca, that is to say, a King of Ceylon. But <em>the Balie Books
being without date and without the author’s name, have no more authority
than all the traditions, whose origin is</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>unknown</em>.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1117" id="FNanchor_1117">[1117]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_577">577</a></span>

This last argument is as ill-considered as it is naïvely expressed.
We do not know of any book in the whole world less authenticated as to
date, authors’ names, or tradition, than our Christian <cite>Bible</cite>. Under
these circumstances the Siamese have as much reason to believe in their
miraculous Sommona-Cadom as the Christians in their miraculously-born
Saviour. Moreover, they have no better right to force their religion upon
the Siamese, or any other people, against their will, and in their own
country, where they go unasked, than the so-called heathen “to compel
France or England to accept Buddhism at the point of the sword.” A
Buddhist missionary, even in free-thinking America, would daily risk
being mobbed, but this does not at all prevent missionaries from abusing
the religion of the Brahmans, Lamas, and Bonzes, publicly to their teeth;
and the latter are not always at liberty to answer them. This is termed
diffusing the beneficent light of Christianity and civilization upon the
darkness of heathenism!</p>

<p>And yet we find that these pretensions—which might appear ludicrous
were they not so fatal to millions of our fellow-men, who only ask to be
left alone—were fully appreciated as early as in the seventeenth century.
We find the same witty Monsieur de la Loubère, under a pretext of pious
sympathy, giving some truly curious instructions to the ecclesiastical
authorities at
 <span class="lock">home,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1118" id="FNanchor_1118">[1118]</a></span>
 which embody the very soul of Jesuitism.</p>

<p>“From what I have said concerning the opinions of the Orientals,”
he remarks, “it is easy to comprehend how difficult an enterprise it is to
bring them over to the Christian religion; and of what consequence it is
that the missionaries, which preach the Gospel in the East, do perfectly
understand the manners and belief of these people. For as the apostles
and first Christians, when God supported their preaching by so
many wonders, did not on a sudden discover to the heathens all the mysteries
which we adore, but a long time concealed from them, and the
Catechumens themselves, the knowledge of those which might scandalize
them; it seems very rational to me that the missionaries, who have not

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_578">578</a></span>
the gift of miracles, ought not presently to discover to the Orientals all
the mysteries nor all the practices of Christianity.</p>

<p>“’Twould be convenient, for example, if I am not mistaken, not to
preach unto them, <em>without great caution</em>, the worshipping of saints; and
as to the knowledge of Jesus Christ, I think it would be necessary to
manage it with them, if I may so say, and <em>not to speak to them of the
mystery of the Incarnation</em>, till after having convinced them of the
existence of a God Creator. For what probability is there, to begin with,
of persuading the Siamese to remove Sommona-Cadom, Pra Mogla, and
Pra Scaribout from the altars, to set up Jesus Christ, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter, and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Paul, in their stead? ’Twould, perhaps, be more proper not to preach
unto them Jesus Christ crucified, till they have first comprehended that
one may be <em>unfortunate</em> and <em>innocent</em>; and that by the rule received,
even amongst them, which is, that the innocent might load himself with
the crimes of the guilty, it was necessary <em>that a god should become man</em>,
to the end that this man-God should, by a laborious life, and a shameful
but voluntary death, satisfy for all the sins of men; but before all things
it would be necessary to give them the true idea of a God Creator, and
justly provoked against men. The Eucharist, after this, will not scandalize
the Siamese, as it formerly scandalized the Pagans of Europe; forasmuch
as the Siamese do not believe Sommona-Cadom could give his
wife and children to the Talapoins to eat.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, as the Chinese are respectful toward their
parents even to a scruple, I doubt not that if the Gospel should be
presently put into their hands, they would be scandalized at that place,
where, when some told Jesus Christ that his mother and his brethren
asked after him, he answered in such a manner, that he seems so little
to regard them, that he affected not to know them. They would <em>not
be less offended</em> at those other mysterious words, which our divine
Saviour spoke to the young man, who desired time to go and bury
his parents: “Let the dead,” said he, “bury the dead.” Every
one knows the trouble which the Japanese expressed to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Francis
Xavier <em>upon the eternity of damnation</em>, not being able to believe that
their dead parents should fall into so horrible a misfortune for <em>want
of having embraced Christianity, which they had never heard of</em>....
It seems necessary, therefore, to prevent and mollify this thought, by
the means which that great apostle of the Indies used, in first establishing
the idea of an omnipotent, all-wise, and most just God, the author
of all good, to whom only everything is due, and by whose will we owe
unto kings, bishops, magistrates and to our parents the respects which we
owe them.</p>

<p>“These examples are sufficient to show with what precautions it is

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_579">579</a></span>
necessary to prepare the minds of the Orientals to think like us, and
<em>not to be offended with most</em> of the articles of the Christian
 <span class="lock">faith.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1119" id="FNanchor_1119">[1119]</a></span></p>

<p>And what, we ask, is left to preach? With no Saviour, no atonement,
no crucifixion for human sin, no Gospel, no eternal damnation to tell
them of, and no miracles to display, what remained for the Jesuits to
spread among the Siamese but the dust of the Pagan sanctuaries with
which to blind their eyes? The sarcasm is biting indeed. The morality
to which these poor heathen are made to adhere by their ancestral faith
is so pure, that Christianity has to be stripped of every distinguishing
mark before its priests can venture to offer it for their examination. A
religion that cannot be trusted to the scrutiny of an unsophisticated
people who are patterns of filial piety, of honest dealing, of deep reverence
for God and an instinctive horror of profaning His majesty, must
indeed be founded upon error. That it is so, our century is discovering
little by little.</p>

<p>In the general spoliation of Buddhism to make up the new Christian
religion, it was not to be expected that so peerless a character as Gautama-Buddha
would be left unappropriated. It was but natural that after
taking his legendary history to fill out the blanks left in the fictitious
story of Jesus, after using what they could of Christna’s, they should take
the man Sakya-muni and put him in their calendar under an <i>alias</i>.
This they actually did, and the Hindu Saviour in due time appeared on
the list of saints as Josaphat, to keep company with those martyrs of
religion, SS. Aura and Placida, Longinus and Amphibolus.</p>

<p>In Palermo there is even a church dedicated to <i>Divo Josaphat</i>.
Among the vain attempts of subsequent ecclesiastical writers to fix the
genealogy of this mysterious saint, the most original was the making
him Joshua, the son of Nun. But these trifling difficulties being at last
surmounted, we find the history of Gautama copied <em>word for word</em> from
Buddhist sacred books, into the <cite>Golden Legend</cite>. Names of individuals

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_580">580</a></span>
are changed, the place of action, India, remains the same—in the Christian
as in the Buddhist Legends. It can be also found in the <i lang="la">Speculum
Historiale</i> of Vincent of Beauvais, which was written in the thirteenth
century. The first discovery is due to the historian de Couto, although
Professor Müller credits the first recognition of the identity of the two
stories to M. Laboulaye, in 1859. Colonel Yule tells us
 <span class="lock">that<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1120" id="FNanchor_1120">[1120]</a></span>
 these
stories of Barlaam and Josaphat, are recognized by Baronius, and are to be
found at <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 348, of <cite>The Roman Martyrology</cite>, set forth by command of Pope
Gregory XIII., and revised by the authority of Pope Urban <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr>, translated

 <span class="lock">Jesus.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1121" id="FNanchor_1121">[1121]</a></span></p>

<p>To repeat even a small portion of this ecclesiastical nonsense would be
tedious and useless. Let him who doubts and who would learn the story
read it as given by Colonel Yule.
 <span class="lock">Some<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1122" id="FNanchor_1122">[1122]</a></span>
 of the Christian and ecclesiastical
speculations seem to have embarrassed even Dominie Valentyn.
“There be some, who hold this Budhum for a fugitive Syrian Jew,”
he writes; “others who hold him for a disciple of the Apostle Thomas;
but how in that case he could have been born 622 years before Christ I
leave them to explain. Diego de Couto stands by the belief that he was
certainly <cite>Joshua</cite>, which is still more absurd!”</p>

<p>“The religious romance called <cite>The History of Barlaam and Josaphat</cite>
was, for several centuries, one of the most popular works in Christendom,”
says <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Yule. “It was translated into all the chief European languages,
including Scandinavian and Sclavonic tongues.... This story
first appears among the works of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of Damascus, a theologian of
the early part of the eighth
 <span class="lock">century.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1123" id="FNanchor_1123">[1123]</a></span>
 Here then lies the secret of its
origin, for this <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, before he became a divine, held a high office at the
court of the Khalif Abu Jáfar Almansur, where he probably learned the
story, and afterwards adapted it to the new orthodox necessities of the
Buddha turned into a Christian saint.</p>

<p>Having repeated the plagiarized story, Diego de Couto, who seems
to yield up with reluctance his curious notion that Gautama was Joshua,
says: “To this name (Budâo) the Gentiles throughout all India have
dedicated great and superb pagodas. With reference to this story, we
have been diligent in inquiring if the ancient Gentiles of those parts had
in their writings any knowledge of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Josaphat who was converted by
Balaam, and who in his legend is represented as the son of a great king
of India, and who had just the same up-bringing, with all the same particulars
that we have recounted of the life of the Budâo. And as I was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_581">581</a></span>
travelling in the Isle of Salsette, and went to see that rare and admirable
pagoda, which we call the Canará Pagoda (Kànhari Caves) made in
a mountain, with many halls cut out of one solid rock, and inquiring of
an old man about the work, what he thought as to who had made it, he
told us that without doubt the work was made by order of the father of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Josaphat to bring him up in seclusion, as the story tells. And as it
informs us that he was the son of a great king in India, it may well be,
as we have just said, that <em>he</em> was the Budâo, of whom they relate such
<span class="lock">marvels.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1124" id="FNanchor_1124">[1124]</a></span></p>

<p>The Christian legend is taken, moreover, in most of its details, from
the Ceylonese tradition. It is on this island that originated the story of
young Gautama rejecting his father’s throne, and the king’s erecting a
superb palace for him, in which he kept him half prisoner, surrounded by
all the temptations of life and wealth. Marco Polo told it as he had it
from the Ceylonese, and his version is now found to be a faithful repetition
of what is given in the various Buddhist books. As Marco naïvely
expresses it, Buddha led a life of such hardship and sanctity, and kept
such great abstinence, “<em>just as if he had been a Christian</em>. Indeed,”
he adds, “had he but been so, he would have been a great saint of our
Lord Jesus Christ, so good and pure was the life he led.” To which
pious apothegm his editor very pertinently remarks that “Marco is not
the only eminent person who has expressed this view of Sakya-muni’s
life in such words.” And in his turn <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Max Müller says: “And
whatever we may think of the sanctity of saints, let those who doubt the
right of Buddha to a place among them, read the story of his life as it is
told in the Buddhistical canon. If he lived the life which is there
described, few saints have a better claim to the title than Buddha; and
no one either in the Greek or the Roman Church need be ashamed of
having paid to his memory the honor that was intended for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Josaphat,
the prince, the hermit, and the saint.”</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Church has never had so good a chance to
Christianize all China, Thibet, and Tartary, as in the thirteenth century,
during the reign of Kublai-Khan. It seems strange that they did not
embrace the opportunity when Kublai was hesitating at one time between
the four religions of the world, and, perhaps through the eloquence of
Marco Polo, favored Christianity more than either Mahometanism,
Judaism, or Buddhism. Marco Polo and Ramusio, one of his interpreters,
tell us why. It seems that, unfortunately for Rome, the embassy
of Marco’s father and uncle failed, because Clement <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr> happened to
die just at that very time. There was no Pope for several months to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_582">582</a></span>
receive the friendly overtures of Kublai-Khan; and thus the one hundred
Christian missionaries invited by him could not be sent to Thibet
and Tartary. To those who believe that there is an intelligent Deity
above who takes a certain concern in the welfare of our miserable little
world, this <i lang="fr">contretemps</i> must in itself seem a pretty good proof that
Buddhism should have the best of Christianity. Perhaps—who knows—Pope
Clement fell sick so as to save the Buddhists from sinking into
the idolatry of Roman Catholicism?</p>

<p>From pure Buddhism, the religion of these districts has degenerated
into lamaism; but the latter, with all its blemishes—purely formalistic
and impairing but little the doctrine itself—is yet far above Catholicism.
The poor Abbé Huc very soon found it out for himself. As he moved
on with his caravan, he writes—“every one repeated to us that, as we
advanced toward the west, we should find the doctrines growing more
luminous and sublime. Lha-Ssa was the great focus of light, the rays
from which became weakened as they were diffused.” One day he gave
to a Thibetan lama “a brief summary of Christian doctrine, which appeared
by no means unfamiliar to him [we do not wonder at that], and
he even maintained that it [Catholicism] did not differ much from the
faith of the grand lamas of Thibet.... These words of the Thibetan
lama astonished us not a little,” writes the missionary; “the unity of
God, the mystery of the Incarnation, the dogma of the real presence,
appeared to us in his belief.... The new light thrown on the religion
of Buddha induced us really to believe that we should find among the
lamas of Thibet a more purified
 <span class="lock">system.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1125" id="FNanchor_1125">[1125]</a></span>
 It is these words of praise
to lamaism, with which Huc’s book abounds, that caused his work to be
placed on the Index at Rome, and himself to be unfrocked.</p>

<p>When questioned why, since he held the Christian faith to be the
best of the religions protected by him, he did not attach himself to it,
the answer given by Kublai-Khan is as suggestive as it is curious:</p>

<p>“How would you have me to become a Christian? There are four
prophets worshipped and revered by all the world. The Christians say
their God is Jesus Christ; the Saracens, Mahomet; the Jews, Moses;
the idolaters, Sogomon Borkan (Sakva-muni Burkham, or Buddha), who
was the first god among the idols; and I worship and pay respect to all
four, and pray that he among them who is greatest in heaven in very
truth may aid me.”</p>

<p>We may ridicule the Khan’s prudence; we cannot blame him for
trustingly leaving the decision of the puzzling dilemma to Providence
itself. One of his most unsurmountable objections to embrace Christianity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_583">583</a></span>
he thus specifies to Marco: “You see that the Christians of these
parts are so ignorant that they achieve nothing and can achieve nothing,
whilst you see the idolaters can do anything they please, insomuch that
when I sit at table, the cups from the middle of the hall come to me full
of wine or other liquor, without being touched by anybody, and I drink
from them. They control storms, causing them to pass in whatever direction
they please, and do many other marvels; whilst, as you know, their
idols speak, and give them predictions on whatever subjects they choose.
But if I were to turn to the faith of Christ and become a Christian, then
my barons and others who are not converted, would say: ‘What has
moved you to be baptized?... What powers or miracles have you witnessed
on the part of Christ? You know the idolaters here say that their
wonders are performed by the sanctity and power of their idols.’ Well,
I should not know what answer to make, so they would only be confirmed
in their errors, and the idolaters, who are adepts in such surprising arts,
would easily compass my death. But now you shall go to your Pope,
and pray him on my part to send hither an hundred men skilled in your
law; and if they are capable of rebuking the practices of idolaters to
their faces, and of proving to them <em>that they too know how to do such
things, but will not</em>, because they are done by the help of the Devil and
other evil spirits; and if they so control the idolaters that these shall
have no power to perform such things in their presence, <em>and when we
shall witness this</em>, we will denounce the idolaters and their religion, and
then I will receive baptism, and then all my barons and chiefs shall be
baptized also, and thus, in the end, there will be more Christians here
than exist in your part of the
 <span class="lock">world.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1126" id="FNanchor_1126">[1126]</a></span></p>

<p>The proposition was fair. Why did not the Christians avail themselves
of it? Moses is said to have faced such an ordeal before Pharaoh,
and come off triumphant.</p>

<p>To our mind, the logic of this uneducated Mongol was unanswerable,
his intuition faultless. He saw good results in all religions, and felt that,
whether a man be Buddhist, Christian, Mahometan, or Jew, his spiritual
powers might equally be developed, his faith equally lead him to the
highest truth. All he asked before making choice of a creed for his people,
was the evidence upon which to base faith.</p>

<p>To judge alone by its jugglers, India must certainly be better acquainted
with alchemy, chemistry, and physics than any European academy. The
psychological wonders produced by some fakirs of Southern Hindustan,
and by the shaberons and hobilhans of Thibet and Mongolia, alike prove
our case. The science of psychology has there reached an acme of perfection

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_584">584</a></span>
never attained elsewhere in the annals of the marvellous. That
such powers are not alone due to study, but are natural to every human
being, is now proved in Europe and America by the phenomena of mesmerism
and what is termed “spiritualism.” If the majority of foreign
travellers, and residents in British India, are disposed to regard the whole
as clever jugglery, not so with a few Europeans who have had the rare
luck to be admitted <em>behind the veil</em> in the pagodas. Surely these will not
deride the rites, nor undervalue the phenomena produced in the secret
lodges of India. The <i>mahadthêvassthanam</i> of the pagodas (usually termed
<i>goparam</i>, from the sacred pyramidal gateway by which the buildings are
entered) has been known to Europeans before now, though to a mere
handful in all.</p>

<p>We do not know whether the prolific
 <span class="lock">Jacolliot<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1127" id="FNanchor_1127">[1127]</a></span>
 was ever admitted into
one of these lodges. It is extremely doubtful, we should say, if we may
judge from his many fantastic tales of the immoralities of the mystical
rites among the Brahmans, the fakirs of the pagodas, and even the Buddhists
(!!) at all of which he makes himself figure as a Joseph. Anyhow,
it is evident that the Brahmans taught him no secrets, for speaking of the
fakirs and their wonders, he remarks, “under the direction of initiated
Brahmans they practice in the seclusion of the pagodas, the <em>occult
sciences</em>.... And let no one be surprised at this word, which seems to
open the door of the supernatural; while there are in the sciences which
the Brahmans call occult, phenomena so extraordinary as to baffle all investigation,
there is not one which cannot be explained, and which is not
subject to natural law.”</p>

<p>Unquestionably, any initiated Brahman could, if he would, explain
every phenomenon. But <em>he will not</em>. Meanwhile, we have yet to see
an explanation by the best of our physicists of even the most trivial occult
phenomenon produced by a fakir-pupil of a pagoda.</p>

<p>Jacolliot says that it will be quite impracticable to give an account of the
marvellous facts witnessed by himself. But adds, with entire truthfulness,
“let it suffice to say, that in regard to magnetism and spiritism, Europe

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_585">585</a></span>
has yet to stammer over the first letters of the alphabet, and that the
Brahmans have reached, in these two departments of learning, results in
the way of phenomena that are truly stupefying. When one sees these
strange manifestations, whose power one cannot deny, without grasping
the laws that the Brahmans <em>keep so carefully concealed</em>, the mind is
overwhelmed with wonder, and one feels that he must run away and break
the charm that holds him.”</p>

<p>“The only explanation that we have been able to obtain on the subject
from a learned Brahman, with whom we were on terms of the closest
intimacy, was this: ‘You have studied physical nature, and you have
obtained, through the laws of nature, marvellous results—steam, electricity,
etc.; <em>for twenty thousand years or more, we have studied</em> the <em>intellectual</em>
forces, we have discovered their laws, and <em>we obtain, by making
them act alone or in concert with matter, phenomena still more astonishing
than your own</em>.’”</p>

<p>Jacolliot must indeed have been stupefied by wonders, for he says:
“We have seen things such as one does not describe for fear of making
his readers doubt his intelligence ... but still we have seen them.
And truly one comprehends how, in presence of such facts, the ancient
world believed ... in possessions of the Devil and in
 <span class="lock">exorcism.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1128" id="FNanchor_1128">[1128]</a></span></p>

<p>But yet this uncompromising enemy of priestcraft, monastic orders,
and the clergy of every religion and every land—including Brahmans,
lamas, and fakirs—is so struck with the contrast between the fact-supported
cults of India, and the empty pretences of Catholicism, that after
describing the terrible self-tortures of the fakirs, in a burst of honest indignation,
he thus gives vent to his feelings: “Nevertheless, these
fakirs, these mendicant Brahmans, have still something grand about them:
when they flagellate themselves, when during the self-inflicted martyrdom
the flesh is torn out by bits, the blood pours upon the ground. But you
(Catholic mendicants), what do you do to-day? You, Gray Friars, Capuchins,
Franciscans, who play at fakirs, with your knotted cords, your flints,
your hair shirts, and your rose-water flagellations, your bare feet and
your comical mortifications—fanatics without faith, martyrs without tortures?
Has not one the right to ask you, if it is to obey the law of God
that you shut yourselves in behind thick walls, and thus escape the law
of labor which weighs so heavily upon all other men?... Away, you
are only beggars!”</p>

<p>Let them pass on—we have devoted too much space to them and
their conglomerate theology, already. We have weighed both in the
balance of history, of logic, of truth, and found them wanting. Their

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_586">586</a></span>
system breeds atheism, nihilism, despair, and crime; its priests and
preachers are unable to prove by works their reception of divine power.
If both Church and priest could but pass out of the sight of the world
as easily as their names do now from the eye of our reader, it would be a
happy day for humanity. New York and London might then soon become
as moral as a heathen city unoccupied by Christians; Paris be cleaner
than the ancient Sodom. When Catholic and Protestant would be as
fully satisfied as a Buddhist or Brahman that their every crime would be
punished, and every good deed rewarded, they might spend upon their
own <em>heathen</em> what now goes to give missionaries long picnics, and to
make the name of Christian hated and despised by every nation outside
the boundaries of Christendom.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As occasion required, we have reinforced our argument with descriptions
of a few of the innumerable phenomena witnessed by us in different
parts of the world. The remaining space at our disposal will be devoted
to like subjects. Having laid a foundation by elucidating the philosophy
of occult phenomena, it seems opportune to illustrate the theme with facts
that have occurred under our own eye, and that may be verified by any
traveller. Primitive peoples have disappeared, but primitive wisdom survives,
and is attainable by those who “will,” “dare,” and can “keep
silent.”</p>

<p class="p2 drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> would argue small discernment on our part were we to suppose that
we had been followed thus far through this work by any but meta-physicians,
or mystics of some sort. Were it otherwise, we should certainly
advise such to spare themselves the trouble of reading this chapter;
for, although nothing is said that is not strictly true, they would not fail
to regard the least wonderful of the narratives as absolutely false, however
substantiated.</p>

<p>To comprehend the principles of natural law involved in the several
phenomena hereinafter described, the reader must keep in mind the fundamental
propositions of the Oriental philosophy which we have successively
elucidated. Let us recapitulate very briefly:</p>

<p>1st. There is no miracle. Everything that happens is the result of
law—eternal, immutable, ever active. Apparent miracle is but the operation
of forces antagonistic to what Dr. W. B. Carpenter, F.R.S.—a man
of great learning but little knowledge—calls “the well-ascertained laws
of nature.” Like many of his class, Dr. Carpenter ignores the fact that
there may be laws once “known,” now unknown to science.</p>

<p>2d. Nature is triune: there is a visible, objective nature; an invisible,
indwelling, energizing nature, the exact model of the other, and its vital
principle; and, above these two, <em>spirit</em>, source of all forces, alone eternal,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_588">588</a></span>
and indestructible. The lower two constantly change; the higher
third does not.</p>

<p>3d. Man is also triune: he has his objective, physical body; his vitalizing
astral body (or soul), the real man; and these two are brooded
over and illuminated by the third—the sovereign, the immortal spirit.
When the real man succeeds in merging himself with the latter, he
becomes an immortal entity.</p>

<p>4th. Magic, as a science, is the knowledge of these principles, and
of the way by which the omniscience and omnipotence of the spirit and
its control over nature’s forces may be acquired by the individual while
still in the body. Magic, as an art, is the application of this knowledge
in practice.</p>

<p>5th. Arcane knowledge misapplied, is sorcery; beneficently used, true
magic or wisdom.</p>

<p>6th. Mediumship is the opposite of adeptship; the medium is the passive
instrument of foreign influences, the adept actively controls himself
and all inferior potencies.</p>

<p>7th. All things that ever were, that are, or that will be, having their
record upon the astral light, or tablet of the unseen universe, the initiated
adept, by using the vision of his own spirit, can know all that has been
known or can be known.</p>

<p>8th. Races of men differ in spiritual gifts as in color, stature, or any
other external quality; among some peoples seership naturally prevails,
among others mediumship. Some are addicted to sorcery, and transmit
its secret rules of practice from generation to generation, with a range
of psychical phenomena, more or less wide, as the result.</p>

<p>9th. One phase of magical skill is the voluntary and conscious withdrawal
of the inner man (astral form) from the outer man (physical body).
In the cases of some mediums withdrawal occurs, but it is unconscious
and involuntary. With the latter the body is more or less cataleptic at
such times; but with the adept the absence of the astral form would not
be noticed, for the physical senses are alert, and the individual appears
only as though in a fit of abstraction—“a brown study,” as some call
it.</p>

<p>To the movements of the wandering astral form neither time nor
space offer obstacles. The thaumaturgist, thoroughly skilled in occult
science, can cause himself (that is, his physical body) to <em>seem</em> to disappear,
or to apparently take on any shape that he may choose. He may
make his astral form visible, or he may give it protean appearances. In
both cases these results will be achieved by a mesmeric hallucination of
the senses of all witnesses, simultaneously brought on. This hallucination
is so perfect that the subject of it would stake his life that he saw a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_589">589</a></span>
reality, when it is but a picture in his own mind, impressed upon his
consciousness by the irresistible will of the mesmerizer.</p>

<p>But, while the astral form can go anywhere, penetrate any obstacle,
and be seen at any distance from the physical body, the latter is dependent
upon ordinary methods of transportation. It may be levitated under
prescribed magnetic conditions, but not pass from one locality to another
except in the usual way. Hence we discredit all stories of the aërial flight
of mediums in body, for such would be miracle, and miracle we repudiate.
Inert matter may be, in certain cases and under certain conditions, disintegrated,
passed through walls, and recombined, but living animal
organisms cannot.</p>

<p>Swedenborgians believe and arcane science teaches that the abandonment
of the living body by the soul frequently occurs, and that we
encounter every day, in every condition of life, such living corpses.
Various causes, among them overpowering fright, grief, despair, a violent
attack of sickness, or excessive sensuality may bring this about.
The vacant carcass may be entered and inhabited by the astral form
of an adept sorcerer, or an elementary (an earth-bound disembodied
human soul), or, very rarely, an elemental. Of course, an adept of
white magic has the same power, but unless some very exceptional and
great object is to be accomplished, he will never consent to pollute
himself by occupying the body of an impure person. In insanity,
the patient’s astral being is either semi-paralyzed, bewildered, and subject
to the influence of every passing spirit of any sort, or it has departed
forever, and the body is taken possession of by some vampirish
entity near its own disintegration, and clinging desperately to earth,
whose sensual pleasures it may enjoy for a brief season longer by this
expedient.</p>

<p>10th. The corner-stone of <span class="allsmcap">MAGIC</span> is an intimate practical knowledge
of magnetism and electricity, their qualities, correlations, and potencies.
Especially necessary is a familiarity with their effects in and upon the
animal kingdom and man. There are occult properties in many other
minerals, equally strange with that in the lodestone, which all practitioners
of magic <em>must</em> know, and of which so-called exact science is
wholly ignorant. Plants also have like mystical properties in a most
wonderful degree, and the secrets of the herbs of dreams and enchantments
are only lost to European science, and useless to say, too, are
unknown to it, except in a few marked instances, such as opium and
hashish. Yet, the psychical effects of even these few upon the human
system are regarded as evidences of a temporary mental disorder. The
women of Thessaly and Epirus, the female hierophants of the rites of
Sabazius, did not carry their secrets away with the downfall of their sanctuaries.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_590">590</a></span>
They are still preserved, and those who are aware of the nature
of Soma, know the properties of other plants as well.</p>

<p>To sum up all in a few words, <span class="allsmcap">MAGIC</span> is spiritual <span class="allsmcap">WISDOM</span>; nature, the
material ally, pupil and servant of the magician. One common vital
principle pervades all things, and this is controllable by the perfected
human will. The adept can stimulate the movements of the natural
forces in plants and animals in a preternatural degree. Such experiments
are not obstructions of nature, but quickenings; the conditions of
intenser vital action are given.</p>

<p>The adept can control the sensations and alter the conditions of the
physical and astral bodies of other persons not adepts; he can also govern
and employ, as he chooses, the spirits of the elements. He cannot control
the immortal spirit of any human being, living or dead, for all such
spirits are alike sparks of the Divine Essence, and not subject to any
foreign domination.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of seership—that of the soul and that of the
spirit. The seership of the ancient Pythoness, or of the modern mesmerized
subject, vary but in the artificial modes adopted to induce the
state of clairvoyance. But, as the visions of both depend upon the
greater or less acuteness of the senses of the astral body, they differ very
widely from the perfect, omniscient spiritual state; for, at best, the subject
can get but glimpses of truth, through the veil which physical nature
interposes. The astral principle, or mind, called by the Hindu Yogin
<i>fav-atma</i>, is the sentient soul, inseparable from our physical brain, which
it holds in subjection, and is in its turn equally trammelled by it. This is
the <em>ego</em>, the intellectual life-principle of man, his conscious entity. While
it is yet <em>within</em> the material body, the clearness and correctness of its
spiritual visions depend on its more or less intimate relation with its
higher Principle. When this relation is such as to allow the most
ethereal portions of the soul-essence to act independently of its grosser
particles and of the brain, it can unerringly comprehend what it sees;
then only is it the pure, rational, <em>super</em>sentient soul. That state is known
in India as the <i>Samâddi</i>; it is the highest condition of spirituality possible
to man on earth. Fakirs try to obtain such a condition by holding
their breath for hours together during their religious exercises, and call
this practice <i>dam-sādhna</i>. The Hindu terms <i>Pranayama</i>, <i>Pratyahara</i>,
and <i>Dharana</i>, all relate to different psychological states, and show how
much more the Sanscrit, and even the modern Hindu language are
adapted to the clear elucidation of the phenomena that are encountered
by those who study this branch of psychological science, than the tongues
of modern peoples, whose experiences have not yet necessitated the
invention of such descriptive terms.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_591">591</a></span>
When the body is in the state of <i>dharana</i>—a total catalepsy of the
physical frame—the soul of the clairvoyant may liberate itself, and perceive
things subjectively. And yet, as the sentient principle of the brain
is alive and active, these pictures of the past, present, and future will be
tinctured with the terrestrial perceptions of the objective world; the
physical <em>memory</em> and <em>fancy</em> will be in the way of clear vision. But the
seer-adept knows how to suspend the mechanical action of the brain.
His visions will be as clear as truth itself, uncolored and undistorted,
whereas, the clairvoyant, unable to control the vibrations of the astral
waves, will perceive but more or less broken images through the medium
of the brain. The seer can never take flickering shadows for realities,
for his memory being as completely subjected to his will as the rest of
the body, he receives impressions directly from his spirit. Between his
subjective and objective selves there are no obstructive mediums. This
is the real spiritual seership, in which, according to an expression of
Plato, soul is raised above all inferior good. When we reach “that which
is supreme, which is <em>simple, pure, and unchangeable, without form, color,
or human qualities</em>: the God—<i>our Nous</i>.”</p>

<p>This is the state which such seers as Plotinus and Apollonius termed
the “Union to the Deity;” which the ancient Yogins called <i>Isvara</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1129" id="FNanchor_1129">[1129]</a>
and the modern call “Samâddi;” but this state is as far above modern
clairvoyance as the stars above glow-worms. Plotinus, as is well known,
was a clairvoyant-seer during his whole and daily life; and yet, <em>he had
been united to his God</em> but six times during the sixty-six years of his existence,
as he himself confessed to Porphyry.</p>

<p>Ammonius Sakkas, the “God-taught,” asserts that the only power
which is directly opposed to soothsaying and looking into futurity is
<i>memory</i>; and Olympiodorus calls it <i>phantasy</i>. “The phantasy,” he
says (in <cite>Platonis <abbr title="Phædrus">Phæd.</abbr></cite>), is an impediment to our intellectual conceptions;
and hence, when we are agitated by the inspiring influence of the
Divinity, if the phantasy intervenes, the enthusiastic energy ceases; for
enthusiasm and the ecstasy are contrary to each other. Should it be
asked whether the soul is able to energize without the phantasy, we
reply, that its perception of universals proves that it is able. It has perceptions,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_592">592</a></span>
therefore, independent of the phantasy; at the same time, however,
the phantasy attends it in its energies, just as a storm pursues him
who sails on the sea.”</p>

<p>A medium, moreover, needs either a foreign intelligence—whether it
be spirit or living mesmerizer—to overpower his physical and mental
parts, or some factitious means to induce trance. An adept, and even a
simple fakir requires but a few minutes of “self-contemplation.” The
brazen columns of Solomon’s temple; the golden bells and pomegranates
of Aaron; the Jupiter Capitolinus of Augustus, hung around with
harmonious
 <span class="lock">bells;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1130" id="FNanchor_1130">[1130]</a></span>
 and the brazen bowls of the Mysteries when the Kora
was
 <span class="lock">called,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1131" id="FNanchor_1131">[1131]</a></span>
 were all intended for such artificial helps.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1132" id="FNanchor_1132">[1132]</a>
    So were the
brazen bowls of Solomon hung round with a double row of 200 pomegranates,
which served as clappers within the hollow columns. The
priestesses of Northern Germany, under the guidance of hierophants,
could never prophesy but amidst the roar of the tumultuous waters.
Regarding fixedly the eddies formed on the rapid course of the river they
<em>hypnotized</em> themselves. So we read of Joseph, Jacob’s son, who sought
for divine inspiration with his silver divining-cup, which must have had
a very bright bottom to it. The priestesses of Dodona placed themselves
under the ancient oak of Zeus (the Pelasgian, not the Olympian
god), and listened intently to the rustling of the sacred leaves, while
others concentrated their attention on the soft murmur of the cold spring
gushing from underneath its
 <span class="lock">roots.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1133" id="FNanchor_1133">[1133]</a></span>
 But the adept has no need of any
such extraneous aids—the simple exertion of his <em>will</em>-power is all-sufficient.</p>

<p>The <cite>Atharva-Veda</cite> teaches that the exercise of such will-power is the
highest form of prayer and its instantaneous response. To desire is to
realize in proportion to the intensity of the aspiration; and that, in its
turn, is measured by inward purity.</p>

<p>Some of these nobler Vedantic precepts on the soul and man’s mystic
powers, have recently been contributed to an English periodical by a
Hindu scholar. “The <i>Sankhya</i>,” he writes, “inculcates that the soul
(<i>i.e.</i>, astral body) has the following powers: shrinking into a minute
bulk to which everything is pervious; enlarging to a gigantic body; assuming
levity (rising along a sunbeam to the solar orb); possessing an
unlimited reach of organs, as touching the moon with the tip of a finger;
irresistible will (for instance, sinking into the earth as easily as in water);
dominion over all things, animate or inanimate; faculty of changing the
course of nature; ability to accomplish every desire.” Further, he gives
their various appellations:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_593">593</a></span></p>

<p>“The powers are called: 1, <i>Anima</i>; 2, <i>Mahima</i>; 3, <i>Laghima</i>; 4,
<i>Garima</i>; 5, <i>Prapti</i>; 6, <i>Prakamya</i>; 7, <i>Vasitwa</i>; 8, <i>Isitwa</i>, or divine
power. The fifth, predicting future events, understanding unknown
languages, curing diseases, divining unexpressed thoughts, understanding
the language of the heart. The sixth is the power of converting old
age into youth. The seventh is the power of mesmerizing human beings
and beasts, and making them obedient; it is the power of restraining
passions and emotions. The eighth power is the spiritual state, and
presupposes the absence of the above seven powers, as in this state the
Yogi is full of God.”</p>

<p>“No writings,” he adds, “revealed or sacred, were allowed to be so
authoritative and final <em>as the teaching of the soul</em>. Some of the Rishis
appear to have laid the greatest stress on this supersensuous source of
<span class="lock">knowledge.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1134" id="FNanchor_1134">[1134]</a></span></p>

<p>From the remotest antiquity <em>mankind</em> as a whole <em>have always been
convinced of the existence of a personal spiritual entity within the personal
physical man</em>. This inner entity was more or less divine, according to its
proximity to the <em>crown</em>—Chrestos. The closer the union the more serene
man’s destiny, the less dangerous the external conditions. This belief is
neither bigotry nor superstition, only an ever-present, instinctive feeling
of the proximity of another spiritual and invisible world, which, though it
be subjective to the senses of the outward man, is perfectly objective to the
inner ego. Furthermore, they believed that <em>there are external and internal
conditions which affect the determination of our will upon our actions</em>.
They rejected fatalism, for fatalism implies a blind course of some still
blinder power. But they believed in <em>destiny</em>, which from birth to death
every man is weaving thread by thread around himself, as a spider does
his cobweb; and this destiny is guided either by that presence termed by
some the guardian angel, or our more intimate astral inner man, who is
but too often the evil genius of the man of flesh. Both these lead on the
outward man, but one of them must prevail; and from the very beginning
of the invisible affray the stern and implacable <em>law of compensation</em> steps
in and takes its course, following faithfully the fluctuations. When the
last strand is woven, and man is seemingly enwrapped in the net-work of
his own doing, then he finds himself completely under the empire of this
<em>self-made</em> destiny. It then either fixes him like the inert shell against the
immovable rock, or like a feather carries him away in a whirlwind raised
by his own actions.</p>

<p>The greatest philosophers of antiquity found it neither unreasonable

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_594">594</a></span>
nor strange that “souls should come to souls, and impart to them conceptions
of future things, occasionally by letters, or by a mere touch, or by
a glance reveal to them past events or announce future ones,” as Ammonius
tells us. Moreover, Lamprias and others held that if the <em>unembodied</em>
spirits or souls could descend on earth and become guardians of mortal
men, “we should not seek to deprive <em>those souls which are still in the
body</em> of that power by which the former know future events and are able
to announce them. It is not probable,” adds Lamprias, “that the soul
gains a new power of prophecy after separation from the body, and
which before it did not possess. We may rather conclude <em>that it possessed
all these powers during its union with the body, although in a
lesser perfection</em>.... For as the sun does not shine only when it passes
from among the clouds, but has always been radiant and has only
appeared dim and obscured by vapors, the soul does not only receive
the power of looking into futurity when it passes from the body as from
a cloud, but <em>has possessed it always</em>, though dimmed by connection with
the earthly.”</p>

<p>A familiar example of one phase of the power of the soul or astral body
to manifest itself, is the phenomenon of the so-called spirit-hand. In the
presence of certain mediums these seemingly detached members will gradually
develop from a luminous nebula, pick up a pencil, write messages, and
then dissolve before the eyes of the witnesses. Many such cases are recorded
by perfectly competent and trustworthy persons. These phenomena are
real, and require serious consideration. But false “phantom-hands” have
sometimes been taken for the genuine. At Dresden we once saw a hand
and arm, made for the purpose of deception, with an ingenious arrangement
of springs that would cause the machine to imitate to perfection the
movements of the natural member; while exteriorly it would require close
inspection to detect its artificial character. In using this, the dishonest
medium slips his natural arm out of his sleeve, and replaces it with the
mechanical substitute; both hands may then be made to seem resting
upon the table, while in fact one is touching the sitters, showing itself,
knocking the furniture, and making other phenomena.</p>

<p>The mediums for real manifestations are least able, as a rule, to comprehend
or explain them. Among those who have written most intelligently
upon the subject of these luminous hands, may be reckoned Dr.
Francis Gerry Fairfield, author of <cite>Ten Years among the Mediums</cite>, an
article from whose pen appears in the <cite>Library Table</cite> for July 19, 1877.
A medium himself, he is yet a strong opponent of the spiritualistic theory.
Discussing the subject of the “phantom-hand,” he testifies that “this
the writer has personally witnessed, under conditions of test provided by
himself, in his own room, in full daylight, with the medium seated upon a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_595">595</a></span>
sofa from six to eight feet from the table hovering upon which the apparition
(the hand) appeared. The application of the poles of a horse-shoe
magnet to the hand caused it to waver perceptibly, and threw the medium
into violent convulsions—pretty positive evidence that <em>the force concerned
in the phenomenon was generated in his own nervous system</em>.”</p>

<p>Dr. Fairfield’s deduction that the fluttering phantom-hand is an emanation
from the medium is logical, and it is correct. The test of the
horse-shoe magnet proves in a scientific way what every kabalist would
affirm upon the authority of experience, no less than philosophy. The
“force concerned in the phenomenon” is the will of the medium, exercised
unconsciously to the outer man, which for the time is semi-paralyzed
and cataleptic; the phantom-hand an extrusion of the man’s inner
or astral member. This is that real self whose limbs the surgeon cannot
amputate, but remain behind after the outer casing is cut off, and (all
theories of exposed or compressed nerve termini to the contrary, notwithstanding)
have all the sensations the physical parts formerly experienced.
This is that spiritual (astral) body which “is raised in incorruption.”
It is useless to argue that these are <em>spirit</em>-hands; for, admitting
even that at every seance human spirits of many kinds are attracted to
the medium, and that they do guide and produce some manifestations,
yet to make hands or faces objective they are compelled to use either the
astral limbs of the medium, or the materials furnished them by the elementals,
or yet the combined aural emanations of all persons present.
<em>Pure</em> spirits will not and <em>cannot</em> show themselves objectively; those that
do are not pure spirits, but elementary and impure. Woe to the medium
who falls a prey to such!</p>

<p>The same principle involved in the unconscious extrusion of a phantom
limb by the cataleptic medium, applies to the projection of his entire
“double” or astral body. This may be withdrawn by the will of the
medium’s own inner self, without his retaining in his physical brain any
recollection of such an intent—that is one phase of man’s dual capacity.
It may also be effected by elementary and elemental spirits, to whom he
may stand in the relation of mesmeric subject. Dr. Fairfield is right in
one position taken in his book, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: mediums are usually diseased, and
in many if not most cases the children or near connections of mediums.
But he is wholly wrong in attributing all psychical phenomena to morbid
physiological conditions. The adepts of Eastern magic are uniformly in
perfect mental and bodily health, and in fact the voluntary and independent
production of phenomena is impossible to any others. We have
known many, and never a sick man among them. The adept retains
perfect consciousness; shows no change of bodily temperature, or other
sign of morbidity; requires no “conditions,” but will do his feats anywhere

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_596">596</a></span>
and everywhere; and instead of being passive and in subjection to
a foreign influence, rules the forces with iron will. But we have elsewhere
shown that the medium and the adept are as opposed as the poles.
We will only add here that the body, soul, and spirit of the adept are all
conscious and working in harmony, and the body of the medium is an
inert clod, and even his soul may be away in a dream while its habitation
is occupied by another.</p>

<p>An adept can not only project and make visible a hand, a foot, or any
other portion of his body, but the whole of it. We have seen one do
this, in full day, while his hands and feet were being held by a skeptical
friend whom he wished to
 <span class="lock">surprise.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1135" id="FNanchor_1135">[1135]</a></span>
 Little by little the whole astral body
oozed out like a vapory cloud, until before us stood two forms, of which
the second was an exact duplicate of the first, only slightly more
shadowy.</p>

<p>The medium need not exercise any <em>will-power</em>. It suffices that she
or he shall know what is expected by the investigators. The medium’s
“spiritual” entity, when not obsessed by other spirits, will act outside
the will or consciousness of the physical being, as surely as it acts when
within the body during a fit of somnambulism. Its perceptions, external
and internal, will be acuter and far more developed, precisely as they are
in the sleep-walker. And this is why “the materialized form sometimes
knows more than the
 <span class="lock">medium,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1136" id="FNanchor_1136">[1136]</a></span>
 for the intellectual perception of the
astral entity is proportionately as much higher than the corporeal intelligence
of the medium in its normal state, as the spirit entity is finer than
itself. Generally the medium will be found cold, the pulse will have visibly
changed, and a state of nervous prostration succeeds the phenomena,
bunglingly and without discrimination attributed to disembodied spirits;
whereas, but one-third of them may be produced by the latter, another
third by elementals, and the rest by the astral double of the medium
himself.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_597">597</a></span></p>

<p>But, while it is our firm belief that most of the physical manifestations,
<i>i.e.</i>, those which neither need nor show intelligence nor great discrimination,
are produced mechanically by the <i>scin-lecca</i> (double) of the medium, as a
person in sound sleep will when apparently awake do things of which he
will retain no remembrance. The purely subjective phenomena are but
in a very small proportion of cases due to the action of the personal astral
body. They are mostly, and according to the moral, intellectual, and
physical purity of the medium, the work of either the elementary, or
sometimes very pure human spirits. Elementals have naught to do with
subjective manifestations. In rare cases it is the <em>divine</em> spirit of the medium
himself that guides and produces them.</p>

<p>As Baboo Peary Chand Mittra says, in a
 <span class="lock">letter<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1137" id="FNanchor_1137">[1137]</a></span>
 to the President of
the National Association of Spiritualists, Mr. Alexander Calder,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1138" id="FNanchor_1138">[1138]</a> “a
spirit is an essence or power, and has no form.... The very idea of
form implies ‘materialism.’ The spirits [astral souls, we should say] ...
can assume forms for a time, but form is not their permanent state. The
more material is our soul, the more material is our conception of spirits.”</p>

<p>Epimenides, the Orphikos, was renowned for his “sacred and marvellous
nature,” and for the faculty his soul possessed of quitting its body
“<em>as long and as often as it pleased</em>.” The ancient philosophers who have
testified to this ability may be reckoned by dozens. Apollonius left his
body at a moment’s notice, but it must be remembered Apollonius was an
adept—a “magician.” Had he been simply a medium, he could not have
performed such feats <em>at will</em>. Empedocles of Agrigentum, the Pythagorean
thaumaturgist, required no <em>conditions</em> to arrest a waterspout which
had broken over the city. Neither did he need any to recall a woman
to life, as he did. Apollonius used no <em>darkened</em> room in which to perform
his æthrobatic feats. Vanishing suddenly in the air before the eyes of
Domitian and a whole crowd of witnesses (many thousands), he appeared
an hour after in the grotto of Puteoli. But investigation would have
shown that his physical body having become invisible by the concentration
of akâsa about it, he could walk off unperceived to some secure retreat
in the neighborhood, and an hour after his astral form appear at Puteoli
to his friends, and seem to be the man himself.</p>

<p>No more did Simon Magus wait to be entranced to fly off in the air
before the apostles and crowds of witnesses. “It requires no conjuration
and ceremonies; circle-making and incensing are mere nonsense and
juggling,” says Paracelsus. The human spirit “is so great a thing that no
man can express it; as God Himself is eternal and unchangeable, so also

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_598">598</a></span>
is the mind of man. If we rightly understood its powers, nothing would
be impossible to us on earth. The imagination is strengthened and developed
through <em>faith in our will</em>. Faith must confirm the imagination, for
faith establishes the will.”</p>

<p>A singular account of the personal interview of an English ambassador
in 1783, with a reïncarnated Buddha—barely mentioned in volume <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>—an
infant of eighteen months old at that time, is given in the <cite>Asiatic
Journal</cite> from the narrative of an eye-witness himself, Mr. Turner, the
author of <cite>The Embassy to Thibet</cite>. The cautious phraseology of a skeptic
dreading public ridicule ill conceals the amazement of the witness, who, at
the same time, desires to give facts as truthfully as possible. The infant
lama received the ambassador and his suite with a dignity and decorum
so natural and unconstrained that they remained in a perfect maze of
wonder. The behavior of this infant, says the author, was that of an old
philosopher, grave and sedate and exceedingly courteous. He contrived
to make the young pontiff understand the inconsolable grief into which the
Governor-General of Galagata (Calcutta) the City of Palaces and the
people of India were plunged when he died, and the general rapture when
they found that he had resurrected in a young and fresh body again; at
which compliment the young lama regarded him and his suite with looks
of singular complacency, and courteously treated them to confectionery
from a golden cup. “The ambassador continued to express the Governor-General’s
hope that the lama might long continue to illumine the
world with his presence, and that the friendship which had heretofore
subsisted between them might be yet more strongly cemented, for the
benefit and advantage of the intelligent votaries of the lama ... all
which made the little creature look steadfastly at the speaker, and graciously
bow and nod—and bow and nod—as <em>if he</em> understood and
approved of every word that was
 <span class="lock">uttered.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1139" id="FNanchor_1139">[1139]</a></span></p>

<p>As <em>if</em> he understood! <em>If</em> the infant behaved in the most natural and
dignified way during the reception, and “when their cups were empty of
tea became uneasy and throwing back his head and contracting the skin
of his brow, continued making a noise till they were filled again,” why
could he not understand as well what was said to him?</p>

<p>Years ago, a small party of travellers were painfully journeying from
Kashmir to Leh, a city of Ladâhk (Central Thibet). Among our guides
we had a Tartar Shaman, a very mysterious personage, who spoke
Russian a little and English not at all, and yet who managed, nevertheless,
to converse with us, and proved of great service. Having learned
that some of our party were Russians, he had imagined that our protection

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_599">599</a></span>
was all-powerful, and might enable him to safely find his way back
to his Siberian home, from which, for reasons unknown, some twenty
years before, he had fled, as he told us, via Kiachta and the great Gobi
Desert, to the land of the
 <span class="lock">Tcha-gars.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1140" id="FNanchor_1140">[1140]</a></span>
 With such an interested object in
view, we believed ourselves safe under his guard. To explain the situation
briefly: Our companions had formed the unwise plan of penetrating
into Thibet under various disguises, none of them speaking the language,
although one, a Mr. K——, had picked up some Kasan Tartar, and
thought he did. As we mention this only incidentally, we may as well say
at once that two of them, the brothers N——, were very politely brought
back to the frontier before they had walked sixteen miles into the weird land
of Eastern Bod; and Mr. K——, an ex-Lutheran minister, could not even
attempt to leave his miserable village near Leh, as from the first days he
found himself prostrated with fever, and had to return to Lahore via Kashmere.
But one sight seen by him was as good as if he had witnessed the
reïncarnation of Buddha itself. Having heard of this “miracle” from
some old Russian missionary in whom he thought he could have more
faith than in Abbé Huc, it had been for years his desire to expose the
“great heathen” jugglery, as he expressed it. K—— was a positivist,
and rather prided himself on this anti-philosophical neologism. But his
positivism was doomed to receive a death-blow.</p>

<p>About four days journey from Islamabad, at an insignificant mud village,
whose only redeeming feature was its magnificent lake, we
stopped for a few days’ rest. Our companions had temporarily separated
from us, and the village was to be our place of meeting. It was there
that we were apprised by our Shaman that a large party of Lamaïc
“Saints,” on pilgrimage to various shrines, had taken up their abode in
an old cave-temple and established a temporary Vihara therein. He
added that, as the “Three Honorable
 <span class="lock">Ones”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1141" id="FNanchor_1141">[1141]</a></span>
 were said to travel along
with them, the holy Bikshu (monks) were capable of producing the
greatest miracles. Mr. K——, fired with the prospect of exposing this
humbug of the ages, proceeded at once to pay them a visit, and from
that moment the most friendly relations were established between the
two camps.</p>

<p>The Vihar was in a secluded and most romantic spot secured against
all intrusion. Despite the effusive attentions, presents, and protestations
of Mr. K——, the Chief, who was Pase-Budhu (an ascetic of great

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_600">600</a></span>
sanctity), declined to exhibit the phenomenon of the “incarnation” until
a certain talisman in possession of the writer was
 <span class="lock">exhibited.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1142" id="FNanchor_1142">[1142]</a></span>
 Upon
seeing this, however, preparations were at once made, and an infant of
three or four months was procured from its mother, a poor woman of
the neighborhood. An oath was first of all exacted of Mr. K——, that he
would not divulge what he might see or hear, for the space of seven
years. The talisman is a simple agate or carnelian known among the
Thibetans and others as <i>A-yu</i>, and naturally possessed, or had been
endowed with very mysterious properties. It has a triangle engraved
upon it, within which are contained a few mystical
 <span class="lock">words.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1143" id="FNanchor_1143">[1143]</a></span></p>

<p>Several days passed before everything was ready; nothing of a mysterious
character occurring, meanwhile, except that, at the bidding of a
Bikshu, ghastly faces were made to peep at us out of the glassy bosom
of the lake, as we sat at the door of the Vihar, upon its bank. One of
these was the countenance of Mr. K——’s sister, whom he had left well
and happy at home, but who, as we subsequently learned, had died some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_601">601</a></span>
time before he had set out on the present journey. The sight affected
him at first, but he called his skepticism to his aid, and quieted himself
with theories of cloud-shadows, reflections of tree-branches, etc., such as
people of his kind fall back upon.</p>

<p>On the appointed afternoon, the baby being brought to the Vihara,
was left in the vestibule or reception-room, as K—— could go no further
into the temporary sanctuary. The child was then placed on a bit of
carpet in the middle of the floor, and every one not belonging to the
party being sent away, two “mendicants” were placed at the entrance
to keep out intruders. Then all the lamas seated themselves on the
floor, with their backs against the granite walls, so that each was separated
from the child by a space, at least, of ten feet. The chief, having
had a square piece of leather spread for him by the <i>desservant</i>, seated
himself at the farthest corner. Alone, Mr. K—— placed himself close
by the infant, and watched every movement with intense interest. The
only condition exacted of us was that we should preserve a strict silence,
and patiently await further developments. A bright sunlight streamed
through the open door. Gradually the “Superior” fell into what seemed
a state of profound meditation, while the others, after a <i lang="la">sotto voce</i> short
invocation, became suddenly silent, and looked as if they had been completely
petrified. It was oppressively still, and the crowing of the child
was the only sound to be heard. After we had sat there a few moments,
the movements of the infant’s limbs suddenly ceased, and his body appeared
to become rigid. K—— watched intently every motion, and both
of us, by a rapid glance, became satisfied that all present were sitting
motionless. The superior, with his gaze fixed upon the ground, did not
even look at the infant; but, pale and motionless, he seemed rather like
a bronze statue of a Talapoin in meditation than a living being. Suddenly,
to our great consternation, we saw the child, not raise itself, but,
as it were, violently jerked into a sitting posture! A few more jerks,
and then, like an automaton set in motion by concealed wires, the four
months’ baby stood upon his feet! Fancy our consternation, and, in Mr.
K——’s case, horror. Not a hand had been outstretched, not a motion
made, nor a word spoken; and yet, here was a baby-in-arms standing
erect and firm as a man!</p>

<p>The rest of the story we will quote from a copy of notes written on
this subject by Mr. K——, the same evening, and given to us, in case it
should not reach its place of destination, or the writer fail to see anything
more.</p>

<p>“After a minute or two of hesitation,” writes K——, “the baby
turned his head and looked at me with an expression of intelligence that
was simply awful! It sent a chill through me. I pinched my hands and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_602">602</a></span>
bit my lips till the blood almost came, to make sure that I did not dream.
But this was only the beginning. The miraculous creature, making, <em>as
I fancied</em>, two steps toward me, resumed his sitting posture, and, without
removing his eyes from mine, repeated, sentence by sentence, in what I
supposed to be Thibetan language, the very words, which I had been
told in advance, are commonly spoken at the incarnations of Buddha,
beginning with ‘I am Buddha; I am the old Lama; I am his spirit in a
new body,’ etc. I felt a real terror; my hair rose upon my head, and
my blood ran cold. For my life I could not have spoken a word.
There was no trickery here, no ventriloquism. The infant lips moved,
and the eyes seemed to search my very soul with an expression that
<em>made me think it was the face of the Superior himself</em>, his eyes, his very
look that I was gazing upon. It was <em>as if his spirit had entered the little
body, and was looking at me through the transparent mask of the baby’s
face</em>. I felt my brain growing dizzy. The infant reached toward me,
and laid his little hand upon mine. I started as if I had been touched
by a hot coal; and, unable to bear the scene any longer, covered my
face with my hands. It was but for an instant; but when I removed
them, the little actor had become a crowing baby again, and a moment
after, lying upon his back, set up a fretful cry. The superior had resumed
his normal condition, and conversation ensued.</p>

<p>“It was only after a series of similar experiments, extending over ten
days, that I realized the fact that I had seen the incredible, astounding
phenomenon described by certain travellers, but always by me denounced
as an imposture. Among a multitude of questions unanswered, despite
my cross-examination, the Superior let drop one piece of information,
which must be regarded as highly significant. ‘What would have happened,’
I inquired, through the shaman, ‘if, while the infant was speaking,
in a moment of insane fright, at the thought of its being the
“Devil,” I had killed it?’ He replied that, if the blow had not been
instantly fatal, the child <em>alone</em> would have been killed.’ ‘But,’ I continued,
‘suppose that it had been as swift as a lightning-flash?’ ‘In
such case,’ was the answer, ‘<em>you would have killed me also</em>.’”</p>

<p>In Japan and Siam there are two orders of priests, of which one are
public, and deal with the people, the other strictly private. The latter
are never seen; their existence is known but to very few natives, never
to foreigners. Their powers are never displayed in public, nor ever at
all except on rare occasions of the utmost importance, at which times
the ceremonies are performed in subterranean or otherwise inaccessible
temples, and in the presence of a chosen few whose heads answer for
their secrecy. Among such occasions are deaths in the Royal family, or
those of high dignitaries affiliated with the Order. One of the most

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_603">603</a></span>
weird and impressive exhibitions of the power of these magicians is that
of the withdrawal of the astral soul from the cremated remains of
human beings, a ceremony practiced likewise in some of the most important
lamaseries of Thibet and Mongolia.</p>

<p>In Siam, Japan, and Great Tartary, it is the custom to make medallions,
statuettes, and idols out of the ashes of cremated
 <span class="lock">persons;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1144" id="FNanchor_1144">[1144]</a></span>
 they
are mixed with water into a paste, and after being moulded into the
desired shape, are baked and then gilded. The Lamasery of Ou-Tay, in
the province of Chan-Si, Mongolia, is the most famous for that work,
and rich persons send the bones of their defunct relatives to be ground
and fashioned there. When the adept in magic proposes to facilitate
the withdrawal of the astral soul of the deceased, which otherwise they
think might remain stupefied for an indefinite period <em>within</em> the ashes,
the following process is resorted to: The sacred dust is placed in a
heap upon a metallic plate, strongly magnetized, of the size of a man’s
body. The adept then slowly and gently fans it with the <i>Talapat</i>
 <span class="lock"><i>Nang</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1145" id="FNanchor_1145">[1145]</a></span>
 a fan of a peculiar shape and inscribed with certain signs, muttering,
at the same time, a form of invocation. The ashes soon become,
as it were, imbued with life, and gently spread themselves out into a thin
layer which assumes the outline of the body before cremation. Then
there gradually arises a sort of whitish vapor which after a time forms
into an erect column, and compacting itself, is finally transformed into
the “double,” or ethereal, astral counterpart of the dead, which in its
turn dissolves away into thin air, and disappears from mortal
 <span class="lock">sight.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1146" id="FNanchor_1146">[1146]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Magicians” of Kashmir, Thibet, Mongolia, and Great Tartary
are too well known to need comments. If <em>jugglers</em> they be, we
invite the most expert jugglers of Europe and America to match them
if they can.</p>

<p>If our scientists are unable to imitate the mummy-embalming of the
Egyptians, how much greater would be their surprise to see, as we have,
dead bodies preserved by alchemical art, so that after the lapse of centuries,
they seem as though the individuals were but sleeping. The
complexions were as fresh, the skin as elastic, the eyes as natural and
sparkling as though they were in the full flush of health, and the wheels
of life had been stopped but the instant before. The bodies of certain
very eminent personages are laid upon catafalques, in rich mausoleums,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_604">604</a></span>
sometimes overlaid with gilding or even with plates of real gold; their
favorite arms, trinkets, and articles of daily use gathered about them,
and a suite of attendants, blooming young boys and girls, but still
corpses, preserved like their masters, stand as if ready to serve when
called. In the convent of Great Kouren, and in one situated upon the
Holy Mountain (Bohté Oula) there are said to be several such sepulchres,
which have been respected by all the conquering hordes that have
swept through those countries. Abbé Huc heard that such exist, but
did not see one, strangers of all kinds being excluded, and missionaries
and European travellers not furnished with the requisite protection, being
the last of all persons who would be permitted to approach the sacred
places. Huc’s statement that the tombs of Tartar sovereigns are surrounded
with children “who were compelled to swallow mercury until
they were suffocated,” by which means “the color and freshness of the
victims is preserved so well that they appear alive,” is one of these idle
missionary fables which impose only upon the most ignorant who accept
on hearsay. Buddhists have never immolated victims, whether human
or animal. It is utterly against the principles of their religion, and no
Lamaist was ever accused of it. When a rich man desired to be
interred in <em>company</em>, messengers were sent throughout the country with
the Lama-embalmers, and children just dead in the natural way were
selected for the purpose. Poor parents were but too glad to preserve
their departed children in this poetic way, instead of abandoning them
to decay and wild beasts.</p>

<p>At the time when Abbé Huc was living in Paris, after his return
from Thibet, he related, among other unpublished wonders, to a Mr.
Arsenieff, a Russian gentleman, the following curious fact that he had
witnessed during his long sojourn at the lamasery of Kounboum. One
day while conversing with one of the lamas, the latter suddenly stopped
speaking, and assumed the attentive attitude of one who is listening to
a message being delivered to him, although he (Huc) heard never a
word. “Then, I must go;” suddenly broke forth the lama, as if in
response to the message.</p>

<p>“Go where?” inquired the astonished “lama of Jehovah” (Huc).
“And with whom are you talking?”</p>

<p>“To the lamasery of * * *,” was the quiet answer. “The Shaberon
wants me; it was he who summoned me.”</p>

<p>Now this lamasery was many days’ journey from that of Kounboum,
in which the conversation was taking place. But what seemed to astonish
Huc the most was, that, instead of setting off on his journey, the
lama simply walked to a sort of cupola-room on the roof of the house
in which they lived, and another lama, after exchanging a few words, followed

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_605">605</a></span>
them to the terrace by means of the ladder, and passing between
them, locked and barred his companion in. Then turning to Huc
after a few seconds of meditation, he smiled and informed the guest that
“he had gone.”</p>

<p>“But how could he? Why you have locked him in, and the room
has no issue?” insisted the missionary.</p>

<p>“And what good would a door be to him?” answered the custodian.
“<em>It is he himself who went away; his body is not needed, and so he left
it in my charge.</em>”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the wonders which Huc had witnessed during his
perilous journey, his opinion was that both of the lamas had mystified
him. But three days later, not having seen his habitual friend and
entertainer, he inquired after him, and was informed that he would be
back in the evening. At sunset, and just as the “other lamas” were
preparing to retire, Huc heard his absent friend’s voice calling as if
from the clouds, to his companion to open the door for him. Looking
upward, he perceived the “traveller’s” outline behind the lattice of the
room where he had been locked in. When he descended he went
straight to the Grand Lama of Kounboum, and delivered to him certain
messages and “orders,” from the place which he “pretended” he had
just left. Huc could get no more information from him as to his <i>aërial</i>
voyage. But he always thought, he said, that this “farce” had something
to do with the immediate and extraordinary preparations for the
polite expulsion of both the missionaries, himself and Father Gabet, to
Chogor-tan, a place belonging to the Kounboum. The suspicion of the
daring missionary may have been correct, in view of his impudent
inquisitiveness and indiscretion.</p>

<p>If the Abbé had been versed in Eastern philosophy, he would have
found no great difficulty in comprehending both the flight of the lama’s
astral body to the distant lamasery while his physical frame remained behind,
or the carrying on of a conversation with the Shaberon that was
inaudible to himself. The recent experiments with the telephone in
America, to which allusion was made in Chapter <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr> of our first volume,
but which have been greatly perfected since those pages went to press,
prove that the human voice and the sounds of instrumental music may
be conveyed along a telegraphic wire to a great distance. The Hermetic
philosophers taught, as we have seen, that the disappearance from sight
of a flame does not imply its actual extinction. It has only passed from
the visible to the invisible world, and may be perceived by the inner
sense of vision, which is adapted to the things of that other and more
real universe. The same rule applies to sound. As the physical ear
discerns the vibrations of the atmosphere up to a certain point, not yet

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_606">606</a></span>
definitely fixed, but varying with the individual, so the adept whose interior
hearing has been developed, can take the sound at this vanishing-point,
and hear its vibrations in the astral light indefinitely. He needs
no wires, helices, or sounding-boards; his will-power is all-sufficient.
Hearing with the spirit, time and distance offer no impediments, and so
he may converse with another adept at the antipodes with as great ease
as though they were in the same room.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can produce numerous witnesses to corroborate our
statement, who, without being adepts at all, have, nevertheless, heard
the sound of aërial music and of the human voice, when neither instrument
nor speaker were within thousands of miles of the place where we
sat. In their case they actually heard interiorly, though they supposed
their physical organs of hearing alone were employed. The adept had,
by a simple effort of will-power, given them for the brief moment the
same perception of the spirit of sound as he himself constantly enjoys.</p>

<p>If our men of science could only be induced to test instead of deriding
the ancient philosophy of the trinity of all the natural forces, they
would go by leaps toward the dazzling truth, instead of creeping, snail-like,
as at present. <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Tyndall’s experiments off the South Foreland,
at Dover, in 1875, fairly upset all previous theories of the transmission
of sound, and those he has made with sensitive
 <span class="lock">flames<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1147" id="FNanchor_1147">[1147]</a></span>
 bring him to the
very threshold of arcane science. One step further, and he would comprehend
how adepts can converse at great distances. But that step will
<em>not</em> be taken. Of his sensitive—in truth, magical—flame, he says:
“The slightest tap on a distant anvil causes it to fall to seven inches.
When a bunch of keys is shaken, the flame is violently agitated, and
emits a loud roar. The dropping of a sixpence into a hand already containing
coin, knocks the flame down. The creaking of boots sets it in
violent commotion. The crumpling or tearing of a bit of paper, or the
rustle of a silk dress does the same. Responsive to every tick of a
watch held near it, it falls and explodes. The winding up of a watch
produces tumult. From a distance of thirty yards we may chirrup to this
flame, and cause it to fall and roar. Repeating a passage from the
<cite>Faërie Queene</cite>, the flame sifts and selects the manifold sounds of my
voice, noticing some by a slight nod, others by a deeper bow, while to
others it responds by violent agitation.”</p>

<p>Such are the wonders of modern physical science; but at what cost
of apparatus, and carbonic acid and coal gas; of American and Canadian
whistles, trumpets, gongs, and bells! The poor heathen have none
such <i lang="la">impedimenta</i>, but—will European science believe it—nevertheless,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_607">607</a></span>
produce the very same phenomena. Upon one occasion, when, in a
case of exceptional importance, an “oracle” was required, we saw the
possibility of what we had previously vehemently denied—namely, a simple
mendicant cause a sensitive flame to give responsive flashes without
a particle of apparatus. A fire was kindled of branches of the <i>Beal</i>-tree,
and some sacrificial herbs were sprinkled upon it. The mendicant
sat near by, motionless, absorbed in contemplation. During the intervals
between the questions the fire burned low and seemed ready to go
out, but when the interrogatories were propounded, the flames leaped,
roaring, skyward, flickered, bowed, and sent fiery tongues flaring toward
the east, west, north, or south; each motion having its distinct meaning
in a code of signals well understood. Between whiles it would sink to
the ground, and the tongues of flame would lick the sod in every direction,
and suddenly disappear, leaving only a bed of glowing embers.
When the interview with the flame-spirits was at an end, the Bikshu
(mendicant) turned toward the jungle where he abode, keeping up a
wailing, monotonous chant, to the rhythm of which the sensitive flame
kept time, not merely like <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Tyndall’s, when he read the <cite>Faërie
Queene</cite>, by simple motions, but by a marvellous modulation of hissing
and roaring until he was out of sight. Then, as if its very life were extinguished,
it vanished, and left a bed of ashes before the astonished
spectators.</p>

<p>Both in Western and Eastern Thibet, as in every other place where
Buddhism predominates, there are two distinct religions, the same as it
is in Brahmanism—the secret philosophy and the popular religion. The
former is that of the followers of the doctrine of the sect of the Sutrântika.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1148" id="FNanchor_1148">[1148]</a>
They closely adhere to the spirit of Buddha’s original teachings
which show the necessity of <em>intuitional</em> perception, and all deductions
therefrom. These do not proclaim their views, nor allow them to be
made public.</p>

<p>“All <em>compounds</em> are perishable,” were the last words uttered by the
lips of the dying Gautama, when preparing under the Sâl-tree to enter
into Nirvana. “Spirit is the sole, elementary, and primordial unity, and
each of its rays is immortal, infinite, and indestructible. Beware of the
illusions of matter.” Buddhism was spread far and wide over Asia, and
even farther, by Dharm-Asôka. He was the grandson of the miracle-worker
Chandragupta, the illustrious king who rescued the Punjâb from
the Macedonians—if they ever were at Punjâb at all—and received
Megasthenes at his court in Pataliputra. Dharm-Asôka was the greatest
King of the Maûrya dynasty. From a reckless profligate and atheist,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_608">608</a></span>
he had become Pryâdasi, the “beloved of the gods,” and never was the
purity of his philanthropic views surpassed by any earthly ruler. His
memory has lived for ages in the hearts of the Buddhists, and has been
perpetuated in the humane edicts engraved in several popular dialects
on the columns and rocks of Allahabad, Delhi, Guzerat, Peshawur,
Orissa, and other
 <span class="lock">places.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1149" id="FNanchor_1149">[1149]</a></span>
 His famous grandfather had united all India
under his powerful sceptre. When the Nâgas, or serpent-worshippers of
Kashmere had been converted through the efforts of the apostles sent out
by the Sthaviras of the third councils, the religion of Gautama spread
like wild-fire. Gândhara, Cabul, and even many of the Satrapies of
Alexander the Great, accepted the new philosophy. The Buddhism
of Nepâl being the one which may be said to have diverged less than
any other from the primeval ancient faith, the Lamaism of Tartary,
Mongolia, and Thibet, which is a direct offshoot of this country, may be
thus shown to be the purest Buddhism; for we say it again, Lamaism
properly is but an external form of rites.</p>

<p>The Upâsakas and Upâsakis, or male and female semi-monastics
and semi-laymen, have equally with the lama-monks themselves, to
strictly abstain from violating any of Buddha’s rules, and must study
<i>Meipo</i> and every psychological phenomenon as much. Those who
become guilty of any of the “five sins” lose all right to congregate with
the pious community. The most important of these is <em>not to curse upon
any consideration, for the curse returns upon the one that utters it, and
often upon his innocent relatives who breathe the same atmosphere with
him</em>. To love each other, and even our bitterest enemies; to offer our
lives even for animals, to the extent of abstaining from defensive arms;
to gain the greatest of victories by conquering one’s self; to avoid all
vices; to practice all virtues, especially humility and mildness; to be
obedient to superiors, to cherish and respect parents, old age, learning,
virtuous and holy men; to provide food, shelter, and comfort for men
and animals; to plant trees on the roads and dig wells for the comfort
of travellers; such are the moral duties of Buddhists. Every Ani or
Bikshuni (nun) is subjected to these laws.</p>

<p>Numerous are the Buddhist and Lamaic saints who have been
renowned for the unsurpassed sanctity of their lives and their “miracles.”
So Tissu, the Emperor’s spiritual teacher, who consecrated
Kublaï-Khan, the Nadir Shah, was known far and wide as much for the
extreme holiness of his life as for the many wonders he wrought. But

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_609">609</a></span>
he did not stop at fruitless miracles, but did better than that. Tissu
purified completely his religion; and from one single province of Southern
Mongolia is said to have forced Kublai to expel from convents
500,000 monkish impostors, who made a pretext of their profession, to
live in vice and idleness. Then the Lamaists had their great reformer,
the Shaberon Son-Ka-po, who is claimed to have been immaculately
conceived by his mother, a virgin from Koko-nor (fourteenth century),
who is another wonder-worker. The sacred tree of Kounboum, the tree
of the 10,000 images, which, in consequence of the degeneration of
the true faith had ceased budding for several centuries, now shot forth
new sprouts and bloomed more vigorously than ever from the hair of
this avatar of Buddha, says the legend. The same tradition makes him
(Son-Ka-po) ascend to heaven in 1419. Contrary to the prevailing idea,
few of these saints are <i>Khubilhans</i>, or Shaberons—reïncarnations.</p>

<p>Many of the lamaseries contain schools of magic, but the most celebrated
is the collegiate monastery of the Shu-tukt, where there are over
30,000 monks attached to it, the lamasery forming quite a little city.
Some of the female nuns possess marvellous psychological powers. We
have met some of these women on their way from Lha-Ssa to Candi, the
Rome of Buddhism, with its miraculous shrines and Gautama’s relics.
To avoid encounters with Mussulmans and other sects they travel by
night alone, unarmed, and without the least fear of wild animals, <em>for
these will not touch them</em>. At the first glimpses of dawn, they take
refuge in caves and viharas prepared for them by their co-religionists at
calculated distances; for notwithstanding the fact that Buddhism has
taken refuge in Ceylon, and nominally there are but few of the denomination
in British India, yet the secret Byauds (Brotherhoods) and
Buddhist viharas are numerous, and every Jain feels himself obliged to
help, indiscriminately, Buddhist or Lamaist.</p>

<p>Ever on the lookout for occult phenomena, hungering after sights,
one of the most interesting that we have seen was produced by one of
these poor travelling Bikshu. It was years ago, and at a time when all
such manifestations were new to the writer. We were taken to visit
the pilgrims by a Buddhist friend, a mystical gentleman born at Kashmir,
of Katchi parents, but a Buddha-Lamaist by conversion, and who generally
resides at Lha-Ssa.</p>

<p>“Why carry about this bunch of dead plants?” inquired one of the
Bikshuni, an emaciated, tall and elderly woman, pointing to a large
nosegay of beautiful, fresh, and fragrant flowers in the writer’s hands.</p>

<p>“Dead?” we asked, inquiringly. “Why they just have been gathered
in the garden?”</p>

<p>“And yet, they are dead,” she gravely answered. “To be born in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_610">610</a></span>
this world, is this not death? See, how these herbs look when alive in
the world of eternal light, in the gardens of our blessed Foh?”</p>

<p>Without moving from the place where she was sitting on the ground,
the Ani took a flower from the bunch, laid it in her lap, and began to
draw together, by large handfuls as it were, invisible material from the
surrounding atmosphere. Presently a very, very faint nodule of vapor
was seen, and this slowly took shape and color, until, poised in mid-air,
appeared a copy of the bloom we had given her. Faithful to the last
tint and the last petal it was, and lying on its side like the original, but
a thousand-fold more gorgeous in hue and exquisite in beauty, as the
glorified human spirit is more beauteous than its physical capsule.
Flower after flower to the minutest herb was thus reproduced and made
to vanish, reappearing at our desire, nay, at our simple thought. Having
selected a full-blown rose we held it at arm’s length, and in a few
minutes our arm, hand, and the flower, perfect in every detail, appeared
reflected in the vacant space, about two yards from where we sat. But
while the flower seemed immeasurably beautified and as ethereal as the
other spirit flowers, the arm and hand appeared like a mere reflection in
a looking-glass, even to a large spot on the fore arm, left on it by a piece
of damp earth which had stuck to one of the roots. Later we learned
the reason why.</p>

<p>A great truth was uttered some fifty years ago by Dr. Francis Victor
Broussais, when he said: “If magnetism were true, medicine would be
an absurdity.” Magnetism <em>is</em> true, and so we shall not contradict the
learned Frenchman as to the rest. Magnetism, as we have shown, is the
alphabet of magic. It is idle for any one to attempt to understand either
the theory or the practice of the latter until the fundamental principle of
magnetic attractions and repulsions throughout nature is recognized.</p>

<p>Many so-called popular superstitions are but evidences of an instinctive
perception of this law. An untutored people are taught by the
experience of many generations that certain phenomena occur under fixed
conditions; they give these conditions and obtain the expected results.
Ignorant of the laws, they explain the fact by supernaturalism, for experience
has been their sole teacher.</p>

<p>In India, as well as in Russia and some other countries, there is an
instinctive repugnance to stepping across a man’s shadow, especially if
he have red hair; and in the former country, natives are extremely reluctant
to shake hands with persons of another race. These are not idle
fancies. Every person emits a magnetic exhalation or aura, and a man
may be in perfect physical health, but at the same time his exhalation may
have a morbific character for others, sensitive to such subtile influences.
Dr. Esdaile and other mesmerists long since taught us that Oriental people,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_611">611</a></span>
especially Hindus, are more susceptible than the white-skinned races.
Baron Reichenbach’s experiments—and, in fact, the world’s entire experience—prove
that these magnetic exhalations are most intense from the
extremities. Therapeutic manipulations show this; hand-shaking is,
therefore, most calculated to communicate antipathetic magnetic conditions,
and the Hindus do wisely in keeping their ancient “superstition”—derived
from Manu—constantly in mind.</p>

<p>The magnetism of a red-haired man, we have found, in almost every
nation, is instinctively dreaded. We might quote proverbs from the
Russian, Persian, Georgian, Hindustani, French, Turkish, and even German,
to show that treachery and other vices are popularly supposed to
accompany the rufous complexion. When a man stands exposed to the
sun, the magnetism of that luminary causes his emanations to be projected
toward the shadow, and the increased molecular action develops more
electricity. Hence, an individual to whom he is antipathetic—though
neither might be sensible of the fact—would act prudently in not passing
through the shadow. Careful physicians wash their hands upon leaving
each patient; why, then, should they not be charged with superstition, as
well as the Hindus? The sporules of disease are invisible, but no less
real, as European experience demonstrates. Well, <em>Oriental experience
for a hundred centuries has shown that the germs of moral contagion
linger about localities, and impure magnetism can be communicated by the
touch</em>.</p>

<p>Another prevalent belief in some parts of Russia, particularly Georgia
(Caucasus), and in India, is that in case the body of a drowned person
cannot be otherwise found, if a garment of his be thrown into the water
it will float until directly over the spot, and then sink. We have even
seen the experiment successfully tried with the sacred cord of a Brahman.
It floated hither and thither, circling about as though in search of something,
until suddenly darting in a straight line for about fifty yards, it sank,
and at that exact spot the divers brought up the body. We find this
“superstition” even in America. A Pittsburg paper, of very recent
date, describes the finding of the body of a young boy, named Reed, in
the Monongahela, by a like method. All other means having failed, it
says, “a curious superstition was employed. One of the boy’s shirts was
thrown into the river where he had gone down, and, it is said, floated on
the surface for a time, and finally settled to the bottom at a certain place,
which proved to be the resting-place of the body, and which was then
drawn out. The belief that the shirt of a drowned person when thrown
into the water will follow the body is well-spread, absurd as it appears.”</p>

<p>This phenomenon is explained by the law of the powerful attraction
existing between the human body and objects that have been long worn

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_612">612</a></span>
upon it. The oldest garment is most effective for the experiment; a new
one is useless.</p>

<p>From time immemorial, in Russia, in the month of May, on Trinity
Day, maidens from city and village have been in the habit of casting upon
the river wreaths of green leaves—which each girl has to form for herself—and
consulting their oracles. If the wreath sinks, it is a sign that the
girl will die unmarried within a short time; if it floats, she will be married,
the time depending upon the number of verses she can repeat during the
experiment. We positively affirm that we have personal knowledge of
several cases, two of them our intimate friends, where the augury of death
proved true, and the girls <em>died</em> within twelve months. Tried on any other
day than Trinity, the result would doubtless be the same. The sinking
of the wreath is attributable to its being impregnated with the unhealthy
magnetism of a system which contains the germs of early death; such
magnetisms having an attraction for the earth at the bottom of the stream.
As for the rest, we are willing to abandon it to the friends of coincidence.</p>

<p>The same general remark as to superstition having a scientific basis
applies to the phenomena produced by fakirs and jugglers, which skeptics
heap into the common category of trickery. And yet, to a close observer,
even to the uninitiated, an enormous difference is presented between the
<i>kîmiya</i> (phenomenon) of a fakir, and the <i>batte-bâzi</i> (jugglery) of a trickster,
and the necromancy of a <i>jâdûgar</i>, or <i>sâhir</i>, so dreaded and despised by
the natives. This difference, imperceptible—nay incomprehensible—to
the skeptical European, is instinctively appreciated by every Hindu,
whether of high or low caste, educated or ignorant. The <i>kangâlin</i>, or
witch, who uses her terrible <i>abhi-châr</i> (mesmeric powers) with intent to
injure, may expect death at any moment, for every Hindu finds it lawful
to kill her; a <i>bukka-baz</i>, or juggler, serves to amuse. A serpent-charmer,
with his <i>bâ-îni</i> full of venomous snakes, is less dreaded, for his powers of
fascination extend but to animals and reptiles; he is unable to charm
human beings, to perform that which is called by the natives <i>mantar
phûnknâ</i>, to throw spells on men by magic. But with the yogi, the sannyâsi,
the holy men who acquire enormous psychological powers by mental
and physical training, the question is totally different. Some of these
men are regarded by the Hindus as demi-gods. Europeans cannot judge
of these powers but in rare and exceptional cases.</p>

<p>The British resident who has encountered in the <i>maidans</i> and public
places what he regards as frightful and loathsome human beings, sitting
motionless in the self-inflicted torture of the <i>ûrddwa bahu</i>, with arms
raised above the head for months, and even years, need not suppose they
are the wonder-working fakirs. The phenomenon of the latter are visible
only through the friendly protection of a Brahman, or under peculiarly

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_613">613</a></span>
fortuitous circumstances. Such men are as little accessible as the real
Nautch girls, of whom every traveller talks, but very few have actually
seen, since they belong exclusively to the pagodas.</p>

<p>It is surpassingly strange, that with the thousands of travellers and
the millions of European residents who have been in India, and have
traversed it in every direction, so little is yet known of that country and
the lands which surround it. It may be that some readers will feel inclined
not merely to doubt the correctness but even openly contradict
our statement? Doubtless, we will be answered that all that it is desirable
to know about India is already known? In fact this very reply
was once made to us personally. That resident Anglo-Indians should
not busy themselves with inquiries is not strange; for, as a British
officer remarked to us upon one occasion, “society does not consider
it well-bred to care about Hindus or their affairs, or even show astonishment
or desire information upon anything they may see extraordinary
in that country.” But it really surprises us that at least travellers
should not have explored more than they have this interesting realm.
Hardly fifty years ago, in penetrating the jungles of the Blue or Neilgherry
Hills in Southern Hindustan, a strange race, perfectly distinct in
appearance and language from any other Hindu people, was discovered
by two courageous British officers who were tiger-hunting. Many surmises,
more or less absurd, were set on foot, and the missionaries, always
on the watch to connect every mortal thing with the <cite>Bible</cite>, even went so
far as to suggest that this people was one of the lost tribes of Israel, supporting
their ridiculous hypothesis upon their very fair complexions
and “strongly-marked Jewish features.” The latter is perfectly erroneous,
the Todas, as they are called, not bearing the remotest likeness to
the Jewish type; either in feature, form, action, or language. They
closely resemble each other, and, as a friend of ours expresses himself,
the handsomest of the Todas resemble the statue of the Grecian Zeus in
majesty and beauty of form more than anything he had yet seen among
men.</p>

<p>Fifty years have passed since the discovery; but though since that
time towns have been built on these hills and the country has been invaded
by Europeans, no more has been learned of the Todas than at the
first. Among the foolish rumors current about this people, the most
erroneous are those in relation to their numbers and to their practicing
polyandry. The general opinion about them is that on account of the
latter custom their number has dwindled to a few hundred families, and
the race is fast dying out. We had the best means of learning much
about them, and therefore state most positively that the Todas neither
practice polyandry nor are they as few in number as supposed. We are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_614">614</a></span>
ready to show that no one has ever seen children belonging to them.
Those that may have been seen in their company have belonged to the
Badagas, a Hindu tribe totally distinct from the Todas, in race, color, and
language, and which includes the most direct “worshippers” of this extraordinary
people. We say <em>worshippers</em>, for the Badagas clothe, feed,
serve, and positively look upon every Toda as a divinity. They are giants in
stature, white as Europeans, with tremendously long and generally brown,
wavy hair and beard, which no razor ever touched from birth. Handsome
as a statue of Pheidias or Praxiteles, the Toda sits the whole day inactive,
as some travellers who have had a glance at them affirm. From the
many conflicting opinions and statements we have heard from the very
residents of Ootakamund and other little new places of civilization scattered
about the Neilgherry Hills, we cull the following:</p>

<p>“They never use water; they are wonderfully handsome and noble
looking, but extremely unclean; unlike all other natives they despise
jewelry, and never wear anything but a large black drapery or blanket of
some woollen stuff, with a colored stripe at the bottom; they never drink
anything but pure milk; they have herds of cattle but neither eat
their flesh, nor do they make their beasts of labor plough or work; they
neither sell nor buy; the Badagas feed and clothe them; they never use
nor carry weapons, not even a simple stick; the Todas can’t read and
won’t learn. They are the despair of the missionaries and apparently
have no sort of religion, beyond the worship of themselves as the Lords
of
 <span class="lock">Creation.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1150" id="FNanchor_1150">[1150]</a></span></p>

<p>We will try to correct a few of these opinions, as far as we have
learned from a very holy personage, a Brahmanam-guru, who has our
great respect.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever seen more than five or six of them at one time;
they will not talk with foreigners, nor was any traveller ever inside their
peculiar long and flat huts, which apparently are without either windows
or chimney and have but one door; nobody ever saw the funeral of
a Toda, nor very old men among them; nor are they taken sick with
cholera, while thousands die around them during such periodical epidemics;
finally, though the country all around swarms with tigers and other
wild beasts, neither tiger, serpent, nor any other animal so ferocious in
those parts, was ever known to touch either a Toda or one of their
cattle, though, as said above, they never use even a stick.</p>

<p>Furthermore the Todas do not marry at all. They seem few in number,
for no one has or ever will have a chance of numbering them; as
soon as their solitude was profaned by the avalanche of civilization—which

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_615">615</a></span>
was, perchance, due to their own carelessness—the Todas began
moving away to other parts as unknown and more inaccessible than the
Neilgherry hills had formerly been; they are not born of Toda mothers,
nor of Toda parentage; they are the children of a certain very select
sect, and are set apart from their infancy for special religious purposes.
Recognized by a peculiarity of complexion, and certain other signs, such
a child is known as what is vulgarly termed a Toda, from birth. Every
third year, each of them must repair to a certain place for a certain
period of time, where each of them must meet; their “dirt” is but a
mask, such as a sannyâsi puts on in public in obedience to his vow;
their cattle are, for the most part, devoted to sacred uses; and, though
their places of worship have never been trodden by a profane foot, they
nevertheless exist, and perhaps rival the most splendid pagodas—<i>goparams</i>—known
to Europeans. The Badagas are their special vassals, and—as
has been truly remarked—worship them as half-deities; for their birth
and mysterious powers entitle them to such a distinction.</p>

<p>The reader may rest assured that any statements concerning them,
that clash with the little that is above given, are false. No missionary
will ever catch one with his bait, nor any Badaga betray them, though he
were cut to pieces. They are a people who fulfill a certain high purpose,
and whose secrets are inviolable.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Todas are not the only such mysterious tribe in
India. We have named several in a preceding chapter, but how many
are there besides these, that will remain unnamed, unrecognized, and yet
ever present!</p>

<p>What is now generally known of Shamanism is very little; and that
has been perverted, like the rest of the non-Christian religions. It is
called the “heathenism” of Mongolia, and wholly without reason, for it
is one of the oldest religions of India. It is spirit-worship, or belief in
the immortality of the souls, and that the latter are still the same men
they were on earth, though their bodies have lost their objective form,
and man has exchanged his physical for a spiritual nature. In its present
shape, it is an offshoot of primitive theurgy, and a practical blending of
the visible with the invisible world. Whenever a denizen of earth desires
to enter into communication with his invisible brethren, he has to assimilate
himself to their nature, <i>i.e.</i>, he meets these beings half-way, and, furnished
by them with a supply of spiritual essence, endows them, in his
turn, with a portion of his physical nature, thus enabling them sometimes
to appear in a semi-objective form. It is a temporary exchange of
natures, called theurgy. Shamans are called sorcerers, because they are
said to evoke the “spirits” of the dead for purposes of necromancy. The
true Shamanism—striking features of which prevailed in India in the days

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_616">616</a></span>
of Megasthenes (300 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>)—can no more be judged by its degenerated
scions among the Shamans of Siberia, than the religion of Gautama-Buddha
can be interpreted by the fetishism of some of his followers in Siam
and Burmah. It is in the chief lamaseries of Mongolia and Thibet that
it has taken refuge; and there Shamanism, if so we must call it, is practiced
to the utmost limits of intercourse allowed between man and
“spirit.” The religion of the lamas has faithfully preserved the primitive
science of <em>magic</em>, and produces as great feats now as it did in the
days of Kublaï-Khan and his barons. The ancient mystic formula of
the King Srong-ch-Tsans-Gampo, the “Aum mani padmé houm,”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1151" id="FNanchor_1151">[1151]</a>
effects its wonders now as well as in the seventh century. Avalokitesvara,
highest of the three Boddhisattvas, and patron saint of Thibet, projects
his shadow, full in the view of the faithful, at the lamasery of Dga-G’Dan,
founded by him; and the luminous form of Son-Ka-pa, under
the shape of a fiery cloudlet, that separates itself from the dancing beams
of the sunlight, holds converse with a great congregation of lamas, numbering
thousands; the voice descending from above, like the whisper of
the breeze through foliage. Anon, say the Thibetans, the beautiful
appearance vanishes in the shadows of the sacred trees in the park of the
lamasery.</p>

<p>At Garma-Khian (the mother-cloister) it is rumored that bad and unprogressed
spirits are made to appear on certain days, and <em>forced</em> to give
an account of their evil deeds; they are compelled by the lamaic adepts
to redress the wrongs done by them to mortals. This is what Huc
naïvely terms “personating evil spirits,” <i>i.e.</i>, devils. Were the skeptics
of various European countries permitted to consult the accounts printed
 <span class="lock">daily<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1152" id="FNanchor_1152">[1152]</a></span>
 at Moru, and in the “City of Spirits,” of the business-like intercourse
which takes place between the lamas and the invisible world, they
would certainly feel more interest in the phenomena described so triumphantly
in the spiritualistic journals. At Buddha-lla, or rather Foht-lla
(Buddha’s Mount), in the most important of the many thousand lamaseries
of that country, the sceptre of the Boddhisgat is seen floating, unsupported,
in the air, and its motions regulate the actions of the community.
Whenever a lama is called to account in the presence of the Superior of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_617">617</a></span>
the monastery, he knows beforehand it is useless for him to tell an
untruth; the “regulator of justice” (the sceptre) is there, and its waving
motion, either approbatory or otherwise, decides instantaneously and
unerringly the question of his guilt. We do not pretend to have witnessed
all this personally—we wish to make no pretensions of any kind. Suffice
it, with respect to any of these phenomena, that what we have not seen
with our own eyes has been so substantiated to us that we indorse its
genuineness.</p>

<p>A number of lamas in Sikkin produce <i>meipo</i>—“miracle”—by magical
powers. The late Patriarch of Mongolia, Gegen Chutuktu, who resided
at Urga, a veritable paradise, was the sixteenth incarnation of Gautama,
therefore a Boddhisattva. He had the reputation of possessing powers
that were phenomenal, even among the thaumaturgists of the land of
miracles <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>. Let no one suppose that these powers are
developed without cost. The lives of most of these holy men, miscalled
idle vagrants, cheating beggars, who are supposed to pass their
existence in preying upon the easy credulity of their victims, are miracles
in themselves. Miracles, because they show what a determined will and
perfect purity of life and purpose are able to accomplish, and to what
degree of preternatural ascetism a human body can be subjected and yet
live and reach a ripe old age. No Christian hermit has ever dreamed
of such refinement of monastic discipline; and the aërial habitation of a
Simon Stylite would appear child’s play before the fakir’s and the Buddhist’s
inventions of will-tests. But the theoretical study of magic is one
thing; the possibility of practicing it quite another. At <i>Brâs-ss-Pungs</i>,
the Mongolian college where over three hundred magicians (<i>sorciers</i>, as
the French missionaries call them) teach about twice as many pupils
from twelve to twenty, the latter have many years to wait for their final
initiation. Not one in a hundred reaches the highest goal; and out of the
many thousand lamas occupying nearly an entire city of detached buildings
clustering around it, not more than two per cent. become wonder-workers.
One may learn by heart every line of the 108 volumes of
 <span class="lock"><i>Kadjur</i>,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1153" id="FNanchor_1153">[1153]</a></span>
 and still make but a poor practical magician. There is but
one thing which leads surely to it, and this particular study is hinted at
by more than one Hermetic writer. One, the Arabian alchemist Abipili,
speaks thus: “I admonish thee, whosoever thou art that desirest to
dive into the inmost parts of nature; if that thou seekest thou findest
not <em>within thee</em>, thou wilt <em>never find it without thee</em>. If thou knowest
not the excellency of thine own house, why dost thou seek after the excellency

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_618">618</a></span>
of other things?... <span class="smcap">O Man, Know Thyself! in thee is hid
the treasure of treasurers.</span>”</p>

<p>In another alchemic tract, <cite lang="la">De manna Benedicto</cite>, the author expresses
his ideas of the philosopher’s stone, in the following terms: “My intent
is for certain reasons not to prate too much of the matter, which yet is
but one only thing, already too plainly described; for it shows and sets
down such magical and natural uses of it [the stone] as many that have had
it never knew nor heard of; and such as, when I beheld them, <em>made my
knees to tremble and my heart to shake, and I to stand amazed at the sight
of them</em>!”</p>

<p>Every neophyte has experienced more or less such a feeling; but
once that it is overcome, the man is an <span class="allsmcap">ADEPT</span>.</p>

<p>Within the cloisters of Dshashi-Lumbo and Si-Dzang, these powers,
inherent in every man, called out by so few, are cultivated to their utmost
perfection. Who, in India, has not heard of the Banda-Chan Ramboutchi,
the <i>Houtouktou</i> of the capital of Higher Thibet? His brotherhood
of Khe-lan was famous throughout the land; and one of the most famous
“brothers” was a <i>Peh-ling</i> (an Englishman) who had arrived one day
during the early part of this century, from the West, a thorough Buddhist,
and after a month’s preparation was admitted among the Khe-lans. He
spoke every language, including the Thibetan, and knew every art and
science, says the tradition. His sanctity and the phenomena produced
by him caused him to be proclaimed a shaberon after a residence of but
a few years. His memory lives to the present day among the Thibetans,
but his real name is a secret with the shaberons alone.</p>

<p>The greatest of the <i>meipo</i>—said to be the object of the ambition of
every Buddhist devotee—was, and yet is, the faculty of walking in the
air. The famous King of Siam, Pia Metak, the Chinese, was noted for
his devotion and learning. But he attained this “supernatural gift”
only after having placed himself under the direct tuition of a priest of
Gautama-Buddha. Crawfurd and Finlayson, during their residence at
Siam, followed with great interest the endeavors of some Siamese nobles
to acquire this
 <span class="lock">faculty.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1154" id="FNanchor_1154">[1154]</a></span></p>

<p>Numerous and varied are the sects in China, Siam, Tartary, Thibet,
Kashmir, and British India, which devote their lives to the cultivation of
“supernatural powers,” so called. Discussing one of such sects, the
<i>Taossé</i>, Semedo says: “They pretend that by means of certain exercises
and meditations one shall regain his youth, and others will attain to be
<i>Shien-sien</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, ‘Terrestrial Beati,’ in whose state every desire is gratified,
whilst they have the power to transport themselves from one place to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_619">619</a></span>
another, <em>however distant</em>, with speed and
 <span class="lock">facility.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1155" id="FNanchor_1155">[1155]</a></span>
 This faculty relates
but to the <em>projection</em> of the <em>astral entity</em>, in a more or less corporealized
form, and certainly not to bodily transportation. This phenomenon is no
more a miracle than one’s reflection in a looking-glass. No one can
detect in such an image a particle of matter, and still there stands our
double, faithfully representing, even to each single hair on our heads. If,
by this simple law of reflection, our double can be seen in a mirror, how
much more striking a proof of its existence is afforded in the art of photography!
<em>It is no reason, because our physicists have not yet found the
means of taking photographs, except at a short distance, that the acquirement
should be impossible to those who have found these means in the power
of the human will itself, freed from terrestrial</em>
 <span class="lock"><em>concern.</em><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1156" id="FNanchor_1156">[1156]</a></span>
 Our thoughts
are <em>matter</em>, says science; every energy produces more or less of a disturbance
in the atmospheric waves. Therefore, as every man—in common
with every other living, and even inert object—has an <em>aura</em> of his
own emanations surrounding him; and, moreover, is enabled, by a trifling
effort, to transport himself in <em>imagination</em> wherever he likes, why is it
scientifically impossible that his thought, regulated, intensified, and guided
by that powerful magician, the educated will, may become corporealized
for the time being, and appear to whom it likes, a faithful double of the
original? Is the proposition, in the present state of science, any more
unthinkable than the photograph or telegraph were less than forty years
ago, or the telephone less than fourteen months ago?</p>

<p>If the sensitized plate can so accurately seize upon the <em>shadow</em> of our
faces, then this shadow or reflection, although we are unable to perceive
it, must be something substantial. And, if we can, with the help of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_620">620</a></span>
optical instruments, project our <em>semblances</em> upon a white wall, at several
hundred feet distance, sometimes, then there is no reason why the adepts,
the alchemists, the savants of the secret art, should not have already
found out that which scientists deny to-day, but may discover true to-morrow,
<i>i.e.</i>, how to project electrically their astral bodies, in an instant,
through thousands of miles of space, leaving their material shells with a
certain amount of animal vital principle to keep the physical life going,
and acting within their spiritual, ethereal bodies as safely and intelligently
as when clothed with the covering of flesh? There is a higher form of
electricity than the physical one known to experimenters; a thousand
correlations of the latter are as yet veiled to the eye of the modern physicist,
and none can tell where end its possibilities.</p>

<p>Schott explains that by <i>Sian</i> or <i>Shin-Sian</i> are understood in the old
Chinese conception, and particularly in that of the Tao-Kiao (Taossé)
sect, “persons who withdraw to the hills to lead the life of anchorites, and
who have attained, either through their ascetic observances or by the
power of charms and elixirs, to the possession of miraculous gifts and of
terrestrial <em>immortality</em>”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1157" id="FNanchor_1157">[1157]</a>(?) This is exaggerated if not altogether erroneous.
What they claim, is merely their ability to prolong human life;
and they can do so, if we have to believe human testimony. What
Marco Polo testifies to in the thirteenth century is corroborated in our
own days. “There are another class of people called <i>Chughi</i>” (Yogi), he
says, “who are indeed properly called <i>Abraiamans</i> (Brahmans?) who
are extremely long-lived, every man of them living to 150 or 200 years.
They eat very little, rice and milk chiefly. And these people make use
of a very strange beverage, a potion of sulphur and quicksilver mixed
together, and this they drink twice every month.... This, they say,
gives them long life; and it is a potion they are used to take from their
 <span class="lock">childhood.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1158" id="FNanchor_1158">[1158]</a></span>
 Burnier shows, says Colonel Yule, the Yogis very skilful
in preparing mercury “so admirably that one or two grains taken every
morning restored the body to perfect health;” and adds that the <i lang="la">mercurius
vitæ</i> of Paracelsus was a compound in which entered antimony
and
 <span class="lock">quicksilver.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1159" id="FNanchor_1159">[1159]</a></span>
 This is a very careless statement, to say the least,
and we will explain what we know of it.</p>

<p>The longevity of some lamas and Talapoins is proverbial; and it is
generally known that they use some compound which “renews the old
blood,” as they call it. And it was equally a recognized fact with alchemists
that a judicious administration, “of <em>aura of silver</em> does restore

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_621">621</a></span>
health and prolongs life itself to a wonderful extent.” But we are fully
prepared to oppose the statements of both Bernier and  <abbr title="Colonel">Col.</abbr> Yule who
quotes him, that it is <em>mercury</em> or quicksilver which the Yogis and the
alchemists used. The Yogis, in the days of Marco Polo, as well as in our
modern times, <em>do use that which may appear to be quicksilver, but is not</em>.
Paracelsus, the alchemists, and other mystics, meant by <i lang="la">mercurius vitæ</i>,
the living spirit of silver, the <em>aura</em> of silver, not the <i lang="fr">argent vive</i>; and
this <em>aura</em> is certainly not the mercury known to our physicians and druggists.
There can be no doubt that the imputation that Paracelsus introduced
mercury into medical practice is utterly incorrect. No mercury,
whether prepared by a mediæval fire-philosopher or a modern self-styled
physician, can or ever did restore the body to perfect health. Only an
unmitigated charlatan ever will use such a drug. And it is the opinion
of many that it is just with the wicked intention of presenting Paracelsus
in the eyes of posterity as a <em>quack</em>, that his enemies have invented
such a preposterous lie.</p>

<p>The Yogis of the olden times, as well as modern lamas and Talapoins,
use a certain ingredient with a minimum of sulphur, and a milky
juice which they extract from a medicinal plant. They must certainly
be possessed of some wonderful secrets, as we have seen them healing
the most rebellious wounds in a few days; restoring broken bones to
good use in as many hours as it would take days to do by means of
common surgery. A fearful fever contracted by the writer near Rangoon,
after a flood of the Irrawaddy River, was cured in a few hours by the
juice of a plant called, if we mistake not, Kukushan, though there may
be thousands of natives ignorant of its virtues who are left to die of
fever. This was in return for a trifling kindness we had done to a <em>simple
mendicant</em>; a service which can interest the reader but little.</p>

<p>We have heard of a certain water, also, called <i>âb-i-hayât</i>, which the
popular superstition thinks hidden from every mortal eye, except that of
the holy sannyâsi; the fountain itself being known as the âb-i-haiwân-î.
It is more than probable though, that the Talapoins will decline to deliver
up their secrets, even to academicians and missionaries; as these
remedies must be used for the benefit of humanity, never for money.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1160" id="FNanchor_1160">[1160]</a>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_622">622</a></span></p>

<p>At the great festivals of Hindu pagodas, at the marriage feasts of rich
high-castes, everywhere where large crowds are gathered, Europeans
find gunî—or serpent-charmers, fakirs-mesmerizers, thaum-working sannyâsi,
and so-called “jugglers.” To deride is easy—to explain, rather
more troublesome—to science impossible. The British residents of India
and the travellers prefer the first expedient. But let any one ask one of
these Thomases how the following results—which they cannot and do not
deny—are produced? When crowds of gunî and fakirs appear with their
bodies encircled with cobras-de-capello, their arms ornamented with
bracelets of <i>corallilos</i>—diminutive snakes inflicting certain death in a few
seconds—and their shoulders with necklaces of trigonocephali, the most
terrible enemy of naked Hindu feet, whose bite kills like a flash of lightning,
the sceptic witness smiles and gravely proceeds to explain how
these reptiles, having been thrown in cataleptic torpor, were all deprived
by the gunî of their fangs. “They are harmless and it is ridiculous
to fear them.” “Will the Saëb caress one of my nâg?” asked
once a gunî approaching our interlocutor, who had been thus humbling
his listeners with his herpetological achievements for a full half hour.
Rapidly jumping back—the brave warrior’s feet proving no less nimble
than his tongue—Captain B——’s angry answer could hardly be immortalized
by us in print. Only the gunî’s terrible body-guard saved him
from an unceremonious thrashing. Besides, say a word, and for a half-roupee
any professional serpent-charmer will begin creeping about and
summon around in a few moments numbers of untamed serpents of the
most poisonous species, and will handle them and encircle his body with
them. On two occasions in the neighborhood of Trinkemal a serpent
was ready to strike at the writer, who had once nearly sat on its tail, but
both times, at a rapid whistle of the gunî whom we had hired to accompany
us, it stopped—hardly a few inches from our body, as if arrested by
lightning and slowly sinking its menacing head to the ground, remained
stiff and motionless as a dead branch, under the charm of the

<p>Will any European juggler, tamer, or even mesmerizer, risk repeating
just once an experiment that may be daily witnessed in India, if you
know where to go to see it? There is nothing in the world more ferocious
than a royal Bengal tiger. Once the whole population of a small
village, not far from Dakka, situated on the confines of a jungle, was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_623">623</a></span>
thrown into a panic at the appearance of an enormous tigress, at the
dawn of the day. These wild beasts never leave their dens but at night,
when they go searching for prey and for water. But this unusual circumstance
was due to the fact that the beast was a mother, and she had
been deprived of her two cubs, which had been carried away by a daring
hunter, and she was in search of them. Two men and a child had already
become her victims, when an aged fakir, bent on his daily round, emerging
from the gate of the pagoda, saw the situation and understood it at a
glance. Chanting a mantrâm he went straight to the beast, which with
flaming eye and foaming mouth crouched near a tree ready for a new victim.
When at about ten feet from the tigress, without interrupting his
modulated prayer, the words of which no layman comprehends, he began
a regular process of mesmerization, as we understood it; he made <em>passes</em>.
A terrific howl which struck a chill into the heart of every human being
in the place, was then heard. This long, ferocious, drawling howl gradually
subsided into a series of plaintive broken sobs, as if the bereaved
mother was uttering her complaints, and then, to the terror of the crowd
which had taken refuge on trees and in the houses, the beast made a
tremendous leap—on the holy man as they thought. They were mistaken,
she was at his feet, rolling in the dust, and writhing. A few moments
more and she remained motionless, with her enormous head laid on
her fore-paws, and her bloodshot but now mild eye riveted on the face of
the fakir. Then the holy man of prayers sat beside the tigress and tenderly
smoothed her striped skin, and patted her back, until her groans became
fainter and fainter, and half an hour later all the village was standing
around this group; the fakir’s head lying on the tigress’s back as on
a pillow, his right hand on her head, and his left thrown on the sod under
the terrible mouth, from which the long red protruding tongue was
gently licking it.</p>

<p>This is the way the fakirs tame the wildest beasts in India. Can
European tamers, with their white-hot iron rods, do as much? Of course
every fakir is not endowed with such a power; comparatively very few
are. And yet the actual number is large. How they are <em>trained</em> to
these requirements in the pagodas will remain an eternal secret, to all
except the Brahmans and the adepts in occult mysteries. The stories,
hitherto considered fables, of Christna and Orpheus charming the wild
beasts, thus receives its corroboration in our day. There is one fact which
remains undeniable. <em>There is not a single European</em> in India who could
have, or has ever boasted of having, penetrated into the enclosed sanctuary
<em>within</em> the pagodas. Neither authority nor money has ever induced a
Brahman to allow an uninitiated foreigner to pass the threshold of the
reserved precinct. To use authority in such a case would be equivalent

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_624">624</a></span>
to throwing a lighted taper into a powder magazine. The Hindus,
mild, patient, long-suffering, whose very apathy saved the British from
being driven out of the country in 1857, would raise their hundred millions
of devotees as one man, at such a profanation; regardless of sects
or castes, they would exterminate every Christian. The East India
Company knew this well and built her stronghold on the friendship of
the Brahmans, and by paying subsidy to the pagodas; and the British
Government is as prudent as its predecessor. It is the castes, and non-interference
with the prevailing religions, that secure its comparative
authority in India. But we must once more recur to Shamanism, that
strange and most despised of all surviving religions—“Spirit-worship.”</p>

<p>Its followers have neither altars nor idols, and it is upon the authority
of a Shaman priest that we state that their true rites, which they are
bound to perform only once a year, on the shortest day of winter, cannot
take place before any stranger to their faith. Therefore, we are confident
that all descriptions hitherto given in the <cite>Asiatic Journal</cite> and other
European works, are but guess-work. The Russians, who, from constant
intercourse with the Shamans in Siberia and Tartary, would be the most
competent of all persons to judge of their religion, have learned nothing
except of the personal proficiency of these men in what they are half
inclined to believe clever jugglery. Many Russian residents, though, in
Siberia, are firmly convinced of the “supernatural” powers of the Shamans.
Whenever they assemble to worship, it is always in an open
space, or a high hill, or in the hidden depths of a forest—in this reminding
us of the old Druidical rites. Their ceremonies upon the occasions of
births, deaths, and marriages are but trifling parts of their worship. They
comprise offerings, the sprinkling of the fire with spirits and milk, and
weird hymns, or rather, magical incantations, intoned by the officiating
Shaman, and concluding with a chorus of the persons present.</p>

<p>The numerous small bells of brass and iron worn by them on the
priestly robe of
 <span class="lock">deerskin,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1162" id="FNanchor_1162">[1162]</a></span>
 or the pelt of some other animal reputed magnetic,
are used to drive away the malevolent spirits of the air, a <em>superstition</em>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_625">625</a></span>
shared by all the nations of old, including Romans, and even the
Jews, whose golden bells tell the story. They have iron staves also covered
with bells, for the same reason. When, after certain ceremonies,
the desired crisis is reached, and “the spirit has spoken,” and the priest
(who may be either male or female) feels its overpowering influence, the
hand of the Shaman is drawn by some occult power toward the top of
the staff, which is commonly covered with hieroglyphics. With his palm
pressing upon it, he is then raised to a considerable height in the air,
where he remains for some time. Sometimes he leaps to an extraordinary
height, and, according to the control—for he is often but an irresponsible
medium—pours out prophecies and describes future events.
Thus, it was that, in 1847, a Shaman in a distant part of Siberia prophesied
and accurately detailed the issue of the Crimean war. The particulars
of the prognostication being carefully noted by those present at the
time, were all verified six years after this occurrence. Although usually
ignorant of even the name of astronomy, let alone having studied this
science, they often prophesy eclipses and other astronomical phenomena.
When consulted about thefts and murders, they invariably point out the
guilty parties.</p>

<p>The Shamans of Siberia are all ignorant and illiterate. Those of
Tartary and Thibet—few in number—are mostly learned men in their
own way, and will not allow themselves to fall under the control of
spirits of any kind. The former are <em>mediums</em> in the full sense of the
word; the latter, “magicians.” It is not surprising that pious and
superstitious persons, after seeing one of such crises, should declare the
Shaman to be under demoniacal possession. As in the instances of
Corybantic and Bacchantic fury among the ancient Greeks, the “spiritual”
crisis of the Shaman exhibits itself in violent dancing and wild gestures.
Little by little the lookers-on feel the spirit of imitation aroused
in them; seized with an irresistible impulse, they dance, and become, in
their turn, ecstatics; and he who begins by joining the chorus, gradually
and unconsciously takes part in the gesticulations, until he sinks to the
ground exhausted, and often dying.</p>

<p>“O, young girl, a god possesses thee! it is either Pan, or Hekaté, or
the venerable Corybantes, or Cybelé that agitates thee!” the chorus
says, addressing Phœdra, in Euripides. This form of psychological epidemic
has been too well known from the time of the middle ages to cite
instances from it. The <i lang="la">Chorœa sancti Viti</i> is an historical fact, and
spread throughout Germany. Paracelsus cured quite a number of persons
possessed of such a spirit of imitation. But he was a kabalist, and
therefore accused, by his enemies, of having cast out the devils by the
power of a stronger demon, which he was believed to carry about with

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_626">626</a></span>
him in the hilt of his sword. The Christian judges of those days of horror
found a better and a surer remedy. Voltaire states that, in the district
of Jura, between 1598 and 1600, over 600 lycanthropes were put to
death by a pious judge.</p>

<p>But, while the illiterate Shaman is a victim, and during his crisis
sometimes sees the persons present, under the shape of various animals,
and often makes them share his hallucination, his brother Shaman,
learned in the mysteries of the priestly colleges of Thibet, <em>expels</em> the elementary
creature, which can produce the hallucination as well as a living
mesmerizer, not through the help of a stronger demon, but simply
through his knowledge of the nature of the invisible enemy. Where
academicians have failed, as in the cases of the Cevennois, a Shaman
or a lama would have soon put an end to the epidemic.</p>

<p>We have mentioned a kind of carnelian stone in our possession,
which had such an unexpected and favorable effect upon the Shaman’s
decision. Every Shaman has such a talisman, which he wears attached
to a string, and carries under his left arm.</p>

<p>“Of what use is it to you, and what are its virtues?” was the question
we often offered to our guide. To this he never answered directly, but
evaded all explanation, promising that as soon as an opportunity was
offered, and we were alone, he would ask the stone <em>to answer for himself</em>.
With this very indefinite hope, we were left to the resources of
our own imagination.</p>

<p>But the day on which the stone “spoke” came very soon. It was
during the most critical hours of our life; at a time when the vagabond
nature of a traveller had carried the writer to far-off lands, where neither
civilization is known, nor security can be guaranteed for one hour. One
afternoon, as every man and woman had left the <i>yourta</i> (Tartar tent),
that had been our home for over two months, to witness the ceremony
of the Lamaïc exorcism of a
 <span class="lock">Tshoutgour,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1163" id="FNanchor_1163">[1163]</a></span>
 accused of breaking and spiriting
away every bit of the poor furniture and earthenware of a family living
about two miles distant, the Shaman, who had become our only protector
in those dreary deserts, was reminded of his promise. He sighed
and hesitated; but, after a short silence, left his place on the sheepskin,
and, going outside, placed a dried-up goat’s head with its prominent
horns over a wooden peg, and then dropping down the felt curtain of the
tent, remarked that now no living person would venture in, for the goat’s
head was a sign that he was “at work.”</p>

<p>After that, placing his hand in his bosom, he drew out the little stone,
about the size of a walnut, and, carefully unwrapping it, proceeded, as it

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_627">627</a></span>
appeared, to swallow it. In a few moments his limbs stiffened, his body
became rigid, and he fell, cold and motionless as a corpse. But for a
slight twitching of his lips at every question asked, the scene would have
been embarrassing, nay—dreadful. The sun was setting, and were it
not that dying embers flickered at the centre of the tent, complete darkness
would have been added to the oppressive silence which reigned.
We have lived in the prairies of the West, and in the boundless steppes
of Southern Russia; but nothing can be compared with the silence at
sunset on the sandy deserts of Mongolia; not even the barren solitudes
of the deserts of Africa, though the former are partially inhabited, and
the latter utterly void of life. Yet, there was the writer alone with what
looked no better than a corpse lying on the ground. Fortunately, this
state did not last long.</p>

<p>“Mahandū!” uttered a voice, which seemed to come from the bowels
of the earth, on which the Shaman was prostrated. “Peace be with
you ... what would you have me do for you?”</p>

<p>Startling as the fact seemed, we were quite prepared for it, for we
had seen other Shamans pass through similar performances. “Whoever
you are,” we pronounced mentally, “go to K——, and try to bring that
person’s <em>thought</em> here. See what that other party does, and tell * * *
what we are doing and how situated.”</p>

<p>“I am there;” answered the same voice. “The old lady (kokona)<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1164" id="FNanchor_1164">[1164]</a>
is sitting in the garden ... she is putting on her spectacles and reading
a letter.”</p>

<p>“The contents of it, and hasten,” was the hurried order while preparing
note-book and pencil. The contents were given slowly, as if,
while dictating, the invisible presence desired to afford us time to put
down the words phonetically, for we recognized the Valachian language
of which we know nothing beyond the ability to recognize it. In such a
way a whole page was filled.</p>

<p>“Look west ... toward the third pole of the yourta,” pronounced
the Tartar in his natural voice, though it sounded hollow, and as if coming
from afar. “Her <em>thought</em> is here.”</p>

<p>Then with a convulsive jerk, the upper portion of the Shaman’s body
seemed raised, and his head fell heavily on the writer’s feet, which he
clutched with both his hands. The position was becoming less and less
attractive, but curiosity proved a good ally to courage. In the west
corner was standing, life-like but flickering, unsteady and mist-like, the
form of a dear old friend, a Roumanian lady of Valachia, a mystic by
disposition, but a thorough disbeliever in this kind of occult phenomena.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_628">628</a></span></p>

<p>“Her thought is here, but her body is lying unconscious. We could
not bring her here otherwise,” said the voice.</p>

<p>We addressed and supplicated the apparition to answer, but all in
vain. The features moved, and the form gesticulated as if in fear and
agony, but no sound broke forth from the shadowy lips; only we
imagined—perchance it was a fancy—hearing as if from a long distance
the Roumanian words, “<i lang="la">Non se póte</i>” (it cannot be done).</p>

<p>For over two hours, the most substantial, unequivocal proofs that the
Shaman’s astral soul was travelling at the bidding of our unspoken wish,
were given us. Ten months later, we received a letter from our Valachian
friend in response to ours, in which we had enclosed the page from
the note-book, inquiring of her what she had been doing on that day,
and describing the scene in full. She was sitting—she wrote—in the
garden on that
 <span class="lock">morning<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1165" id="FNanchor_1165">[1165]</a></span>
 prosaically occupied in boiling some conserves;
the letter sent to her was word for word the copy of the one
received by her from her brother; all at once—in consequence of the
heat, she thought—she fainted, and remembered distinctly <em>dreaming</em> she
saw the writer in a desert place which she accurately described, and
sitting under a “gypsy’s tent,” as she expressed it. “Henceforth,” she
added, “I can doubt no longer!”</p>

<p>But our experiment was proved still better. We had directed the
Shaman’s inner <em>ego</em> to the same friend heretofore mentioned in this
chapter, the Kutchi of Lha-Ssa, who travels constantly to British India
and back. <em>We know</em> that he was apprised of our critical situation in
the desert; for a few hours later came help, and we were rescued by a
party of twenty-five horsemen who had been directed by their chief to
find us at the place where we were, which no living man endowed with
common powers could have known. The chief of this escort was a
Shaberon, an “adept” whom we had never seen before, nor did we
after that, for he never left his <i>soumay</i> (lamasery), and we could have no
access to it. But <em>he was a personal friend of the Kutchi</em>.</p>

<p>The above will of course provoke naught but incredulity in the general
reader. But we write for those who will believe; who, like the
writer, understand and know the illimitable powers and possibilities of
the human astral soul. In this case we willingly believe, nay, we know,
that the “spiritual double” of the Shaman did not act alone, for he was
no adept, but simply a medium. According to a favorite expression of
his, as soon as he placed the stone in his mouth, his “father appeared,
dragged him out of his skin, and took him wherever he wanted,” and at
his bidding.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_629">629</a></span></p>

<p>One who has only witnessed the chemical, optical, mechanical, and
sleight-of-hand performances of European prestidigitateurs, is not prepared
to see, without amazement, the open-air and off-hand exhibitions of Hindu
jugglers, to say nothing of fakirs. Of the mere displays of deceptive
dexterity we make no account, for Houdin and others far excel them in
that respect; nor do we dwell upon feats that permit of confederacy,
whether resorted to or not. It is unquestionably true that non-expert
travellers, especially if of an imaginative turn of mind, exaggerate inordinately.
But our remark is based upon a class of phenomena not to be
accounted for upon any of the familiar hypotheses. “I have seen,” says
a gentleman who resided in India, “a man throw up into the air a number
of balls numbered in succession from one upwards. As each went
up—and there was no deception about their going up—the ball was seen
clearly in the air, getting smaller and smaller, till it disappeared altogether
out of sight. When they were all up, twenty or more, the operator
would politely ask which ball you wanted to see, and then would
shout out, ‘No. 1,’ ‘No. 15,’ and so on, as instructed by the spectators,
when the ball demanded would bound to his feet violently from some remote
distance.... These fellows have very scanty clothing, and apparently
no apparatus whatever. Then, I have seen them swallow three
different colored powders, and then, throwing back the head, wash them
down with water, drunk, in the native fashion, in a continuous stream
from a <i>lotah</i>, or brass-pot, held at arm’s length from the lips, and keep
on drinking till the swollen body could not hold another drop, and water
overflowed from the lips. Then, these fellows, after squirting out the
water in their mouths, have spat out the three powders on a clean piece
of paper, dry and
 <span class="lock">unmixed.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1166" id="FNanchor_1166">[1166]</a></span></p>

<p>In the eastern portion of Turkey and Persia, have dwelt, from time
immemorial, the warlike tribes of the Koordistan. This people of
purely Indo-European origin, and without a drop of Semitic blood in
them (though some ethnologists seem to think otherwise), notwithstanding
their brigand-like disposition, unite in themselves the mysticism of
the Hindu and the practices of the Assyrio-Chaldean magians, vast portions
of whose territory they have helped themselves to, and will not
give up, to please either Turkey or even all
 <span class="lock">Europe.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1167" id="FNanchor_1167">[1167]</a></span>
 Nominally,
Mahometans of the sect of Omar, their rites and doctrines are purely
magical and magian. Even those who are Christian Nestorians, are
Christians but in name. The Kaldany, numbering nearly 100,000 men,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_630">630</a></span>
and with their two Patriarchs, are undeniably rather Manicheans than
Nestorians. Many of them are Yezids.</p>

<p>One of these tribes is noted for its fire-worshipping predilections.
At sunrise and sunset, the horsemen alight and, turning towards the sun,
mutter a prayer; while at every new moon they perform mysterious rites
throughout the whole night. They have a tent set apart for the purpose,
and its thick, black, woolen fabric is decorated with weird signs, worked
in bright red and yellow. In the centre is placed a kind of altar, encircled
by three brass bands, to which are suspended numerous rings by
ropes of camel’s hair, which every worshipper holds with his right hand
during the ceremony. On the altar burns a curious, old-fashioned silver
lamp, a relic found possibly among the ruins of
 <span class="lock">Persepolis.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1168" id="FNanchor_1168">[1168]</a></span>
 This
lamp, with three wicks, is an oblong cup with a handle to it, and is
evidently of the class of Egyptian sepulchral lamps, once found in such
profusion in the subterranean caves of Memphis, if we may believe
 <span class="lock">Kircher.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1169" id="FNanchor_1169">[1169]</a></span>
 It widened from its end toward the middle, and its upper
part was of the shape of a heart; the apertures for the wicks forming a
triangle, and its centre being covered by an inverted heliotrope attached
to a gracefully-curved stalk proceeding from the handle of the lamp.
This ornament clearly bespoke its origin. It was one of the sacred
vessels used in sun-worship. The Greeks gave the <i>heliotrope</i> its name
from its strange propensity to ever incline towards the sun. The ancient
Magi used it in their worship; and who knows but Darius had performed
the mysterious rites with its triple light illuminating the face of the king-hierophant!</p>

<p>If we mention the lamp at all, it is because there happened to be a
strange story in connection with it. What the Koords do, during their
nocturnal rites of lunar-worship, we know but from hearsay; for they conceal
it carefully, and no stranger could be admitted to witness the ceremony.
But every tribe has one old man, sometimes several, regarded
as “holy beings,” who know the past, and can divulge the secrets of the
future. These are greatly honored, and generally resorted to for information
in cases of theft, murders, or danger.</p>

<p>Travelling from one tribe to the other, we passed some time in company
with these Koords. As our object is not autobiographical, we
omit all details that have no immediate bearing upon some occult fact,
and even of these, have room but for a few. We will then simply state

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_631">631</a></span>
that a very expensive saddle, a carpet, and two Circassian daggers,
richly mounted and chiselled in gold, had been stolen from the tent, and
that the Koords, with the chief of the tribe at the head, had come,
taking Allah for their witness that the culprit could not belong to their
tribe. We believed it, for it would have been unprecedented among
these nomadic tribes of Asia, as famed for the sacredness in which they
hold their guests, as for the ease with which they plunder and occasionally
murder them, when once they have passed the boundaries of their
<i>aoûl</i>.</p>

<p>A suggestion was then made by a Georgian belonging to our caravan
to have resort to the light of the <i>koodian</i> (sorcerer) of their tribe. This
was arranged in great secrecy and solemnity, and the interview appointed
to take place at midnight, when the moon would be at its full. At the
stated hour we were conducted to the above-described tent.</p>

<p>A large hole, or square aperture, was managed in the arched roof of
the tent, and through it poured in vertically the radiant moonbeams,
mingling with the vacillating triple flame of the little lamp. After several
minutes of incantations, addressed, as it seemed to us, to the moon,
the conjurer, an old man of tremendous stature, whose pyramidal turban
touched the top of the tent, produced a round looking-glass, of the kind
known as “Persian mirrors.” Having unscrewed its cover, he then proceeded
to breathe on it, for over ten minutes, and wipe off the moisture
from the surface with a package of herbs, muttering incantations the while
<i lang="la">sotto voce</i>. After every wiping the glass became more and more brilliant,
till its crystal seemed to radiate refulgent phosphoric rays in every direction.
At last the operation was ended; the old man, with the mirror in
his hand, remained as motionless as if he had been a statue. “Look,
Hanoum ... look steadily,” he whispered, hardly moving his lips. Shadows
and dark spots began gathering, where one moment before nothing
was reflected but the radiant face of the full moon. A few more seconds,
and there appeared the well-known saddle, carpet, and daggers, which
seemed to be rising as from a deep, clear water, and becoming with every
instant more definitely outlined. Then a still darker shadow appeared
hovering over these objects, which gradually condensed itself, and then
came out, as visibly as at the small end of a telescope, the full figure of a
man crouching over them.</p>

<p>“I know him!” exclaimed the writer. “It is the Tartar who came
to us last night, offering to sell his mule!”</p>

<p>The image disappeared, as if by enchantment. The old man nodded
assent, but remained motionless. Then he muttered again some strange
words, and suddenly began a song. The tune was slow and monotonous,
but after he had sung a few stanzas in the same unknown tongue, without

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_632">632</a></span>
changing either rhythm or tune, he pronounced, <em>recitative</em>-like, the following
words, in his broken Russian:</p>

<p>“Now, Hanoum, look well, whether we will catch him—the fate of
the robber—we will learn this night,” etc.</p>

<p>The same shadows began gathering, and then, almost without transition,
we saw the man lying on his back, in a pool of blood, across the
saddle, and two other men galloping off at a distance. Horror-stricken,
and sick at the sight of this picture, we desired to see no more. The old
man, leaving the tent, called some of the Koords standing outside, and
seemed to give them instructions. Two minutes later, a dozen of horsemen
were galloping off at full speed down the side of the mountain on
which we were encamped.</p>

<p>Early in the morning they returned with the lost objects. The saddle
was all covered with coagulated blood, and of course abandoned to them.
The story they told was, that upon coming in sight of the fugitive, they
saw disappearing over the crest of a distant hill two horsemen, and upon
riding up, the Tartar thief was found dead upon the stolen property,
exactly as we had seen him in the magical glass. He had been murdered
by the two banditti, whose evident design to rob him was interrupted by
the sudden appearance of the party sent by the old Koodian.</p>

<p>The most remarkable results are produced by the Eastern “wise
men,” by the simple act of breathing upon a person, whether with good
or evil intent. This is pure mesmerism; and among the Persian dervishes
who practice it the animal magnetism is often reinforced by that
of the elements. If a person happens to stand facing a certain wind,
there is always danger, they think; and many of the “learned ones” in
occult matters can never be prevailed upon to go at sunset in a certain
direction from whence blows the wind. We have known an old Persian
from
 <span class="lock">Baku,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1170" id="FNanchor_1170">[1170]</a></span>
 on the Caspian Sea, who had the most unenviable reputation
for <em>throwing spells</em> through the timely help of this wind, which blows but
too often at that town, as its Persian name itself
 <span class="lock">shows.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1171" id="FNanchor_1171">[1171]</a></span>
 If a victim,
against whom the wrath of the old fiend was kindled, happened to be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_633">633</a></span>
facing this wind, he would appear, as if by enchantment, cross the road
rapidly, and breathe in his face. From that moment, the latter would
find himself afflicted with every evil—he was under the spell of the “evil
eye.”</p>

<p>The employment of the human breath by the sorcerer as an adjunct
for the accomplishment of his nefarious purpose, is strikingly illustrated
in several terrible cases recorded in the French annals—notably those
of several Catholic priests. In fact, this species of sorcery was known
from the oldest times. The Emperor Constantine (in Statute <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr>, <cite>Code de
Malef.</cite>, etc.) prescribed the severest penalties against such as should employ
sorcery to do violence to chastity and excite unlawful passion.
Augustine (<i lang="fr">Cité de Dieu</i>) warns against it; Jerome, Gregory, Nazianzen
and many other ecclesiastical authorities, lend their denunciation of a
crime not uncommon among the clergy. Baffet (book v., tit. 19, chap.
6) relates the case of the curé of Peifane, who accomplished the ruin of a
highly-respected and virtuous lady parishioner, the Dame du Lieu, by
resort to sorcery, and was burned alive for it by the Parliament of Grenoble.
In 1611, a priest named Gaufridy was burned by the Parliament of Provence
for seducing a penitent at the confessional, named Magdelaine de
la Palud, <em>by breathing upon her</em>, and thus throwing her into a delirium of
sinful love for him.</p>

<p>The above cases are cited in the official report of the famous case of
Father Girard, a Jesuit priest of very great influence, who, in 1731, was
tried before the Parliament of Aix, France, for the seduction of his parishioner,
Mlle. Catherine Cadière, of Toulon, and certain revolting crimes
in connection with the same. The indictment charged that the offence
was brought about by resort to sorcery. Mlle. Cadière was a young lady
noted for her beauty, piety, and exemplary virtues. Her attention to
her religious duties was exceptionally rigorous, and that was the cause
of her perdition. Father Girard’s eye fell upon her, and he began to
manœuvre for her ruin. Gaining the confidence of the girl and her family
by his apparent great sanctity, he one day made a pretext to blow his
breath upon her. The girl became instantly affected with a violent passion
for him. She also had ecstatic visions of a religious character, stigmata,
or blood-marks of the “Passion,” and hysterical convulsions. The long-sought
opportunity of seclusion with his penitent finally offering, the Jesuit
breathed upon her again, and before the poor girl recovered her senses,
his object had been accomplished. By sophistry and the excitation of her
religious fervor, he kept up this illicit relation for months, without her
suspecting that she had done anything wrong. Finally, however, her
eyes were opened, her parents informed, and the priest was arraigned.
Judgment was rendered October 12th, 1731. Of twenty-five judges,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_634">634</a></span>
twelve voted to send him to the stake. The criminal priest was defended
by all the power of the Society of Jesus, and it is said that a million
francs were spent in trying to suppress the evidence produced at the
trial. The facts, however, were printed in a work (in 5 <abbr title="volumes">vols.</abbr>, 16mo),
now rare, entitled <cite lang="fr">Recueil Général des Pièces contenues au Procez du Père
Jean-Baptiste Girard, Jesuite</cite>, etc.,
 <span class="lock">etc.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1172" id="FNanchor_1172">[1172]</a></span></p>

<p>We have noted the circumstance that, while under the sorcerous influence
of Father Girard, and in illicit relations with him, Mlle. Cadière’s
body was marked with the <i lang="it">stigmata</i> of the <i>Passion</i>, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: the bleeding
wounds of thorns on her brow, of nails in her hands and feet, and of a
lance-cut in her side. It should be added that the same marks were
seen upon the bodies of six other penitents of this priest, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: Mesdames
Guyol, Laugier, Grodier, Allemande, Batarelle, and Reboul. In
fact, it became commonly remarked that Father Girard’s handsome parishioners
were strangely given to ecstasies and <i lang="it">stigmata</i>! Add this to
the fact that, in the case of Father Gaufridy, above noted, the same
thing was proved, upon surgical testimony, to have happened to Mlle. de
Palud, and we have something worth the attention of all (especially
spiritualists) who imagine these <i lang="it">stigmata</i> are produced by pure spirits.
Barring the agency of the Devil, whom we have quietly put to rest in
another chapter, Catholics would be puzzled, we fancy, despite all their
infallibility, to distinguish between the stigmata of the sorcerers and those
produced through the intervention of the Holy Ghost or the angels.
The Church records abound in instances of alleged diabolical imitations
of these signs of saintship, but, as we have remarked, the Devil is out
of court.</p>

<p>By those who have followed us thus far, it will naturally be asked, to
what practical issue this book tends; much has been said about magic and
its potentiality, much of the immense antiquity of its practice. Do we
wish to affirm that the occult sciences ought to be studied and practiced
throughout the world? Would we replace modern spiritualism with the
ancient magic? Neither; the substitution could not be made, nor the
study universally prosecuted, without incurring the risk of enormous public
dangers. At this moment, a well-known spiritualist and lecturer on
mesmerism is imprisoned on the charge of raping a subject whom he had
hypnotized. A sorcerer is a public enemy, and mesmerism may most
readily be turned into the worst of sorceries.</p>

<p>We would have neither scientists, theologians, nor spiritualists turn
practical magicians, but all to realize that there was true science, profound

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_635">635</a></span>
religion, and genuine phenomena before this modern era. We would
that all who have a voice in the education of the masses should first know
and then <em>teach</em> that the safest guides to human happiness and enlightenment
are those writings which have descended to us from the remotest
antiquity; and that nobler spiritual aspirations and a higher average morality
prevail in the countries where the people take their precepts as the
rule of their lives. We would have all to realize that magical, <i>i.e.</i>,
spiritual powers exist in every man, and those few to practice them who
feel called to teach, and are ready to pay the price of discipline and self-conquest
which their development exacts.</p>

<p>Many men have arisen who had glimpses of the truth, and fancied
they had it all. Such have failed to achieve the good they might have
done and sought to do, because vanity has made them thrust their personality
into such undue prominence as to interpose it between their
believers and the <em>whole</em> truth that lay behind. The world needs no
sectarian church, whether of Buddha, Jesus, Mahomet, Swedenborg, Calvin,
or any other. There being but <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span> Truth, man requires but one
church—the Temple of God within us, walled in by matter but penetrable
by any one who can find the way; <em>the pure in heart see God</em>.</p>

<p><em>The trinity of nature is the lock of magic, the trinity of man the key
that fits it.</em> Within the solemn precincts of the sanctuary the <span class="smcap">Supreme</span>
had and has no name. It is unthinkable and unpronounceable; and yet
every man finds in himself his god. “Who art thou, O fair being?” inquires
the disembodied soul, in the <i>Khordah-Avesta</i>, at the gates of Paradise.
“I am, O Soul, <em>thy good and pure thoughts</em>, thy works and thy <em>good law</em>
... thy angel ... and thy god.” Then man, or the soul, is reunited
with <span class="allsmcap">ITSELF</span>, for this “Son of God” is one with him; it is his own mediator,
the <em>god</em> of his human soul and his “Justifier.” “<em>God not revealing
himself immediately to man, the spirit is his interpreter</em>,” says Plato
in the <cite>Banquet</cite>.</p>

<p>Besides, there are many good reasons why the study of magic, except
in its broad philosophy, is nearly impracticable in Europe and America.
Magic being what it is, the most difficult of all sciences to learn experimentally—its
acquisition is practically beyond the reach of the majority
of white-skinned people; and that, whether their effort is made at home
or in the East. Probably not more than one man in a million of European
blood is fitted—either physically, morally, or psychologically—to
become a practical magician, and not one in ten millions would be found
endowed with all these three qualifications as required for the work.
Civilized nations lack the phenomenal powers of endurance, both mental
and physical, of the Easterns; the favoring temperamental idiosyncrasies
of the Orientals are utterly wanting in them. In the Hindu, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_636">636</a></span>
Arabian, the Thibetan, an intuitive perception of the possibilities of
occult natural forces in subjection to human will, comes by inheritance;
and in them, the physical senses as well as the spiritual are far more
finely developed than in the Western races. Notwithstanding the notable
difference of thickness between the skulls of a European and a Southern
Hindu, this difference, being a purely climatic result, due to the intensity
of the sun’s rays, involves no psychological principles. Furthermore,
there would be tremendous difficulties in the way of <em>training</em>, if we can
so express it. Contaminated by centuries of dogmatic superstition, by
an ineradicable—though quite unwarranted—sense of superiority over
those whom the English term so contemptuously “niggers,” the white
European would hardly submit himself to the practical tuition of either
Kopt, Brahman, or Lama. To become a neophyte, one must be ready
to devote himself heart and soul to the study of mystic sciences. Magic—most
imperative of mistresses—brooks no rival. Unlike other sciences,
a theoretical knowledge of formulæ without mental capacities or soul
powers, is utterly useless in magic. The spirit must hold in complete
subjection the combativeness of what is loosely termed educated reason,
until facts have vanquished cold human sophistry.</p>

<p>Those best prepared to appreciate occultism are the spiritualists, although,
through prejudice, until now they have been the bitterest opponents
to its introduction to public notice. Despite all foolish negations
and denunciations, their phenomena are real. Despite, also, their own
assertions they are wholly misunderstood by themselves. The totally
insufficient theory of the constant agency of disembodied human spirits
in their production has been the bane of the <em>Cause</em>. A thousand mortifying
rebuffs have failed to open their reason or intuition to the truth.
Ignoring the teachings of the past, they have discovered no substitute.
We offer them philosophical deduction instead of unverifiable hypothesis,
scientific analysis and demonstration instead of undiscriminating faith.
Occult philosophy gives them the means of meeting the reasonable requirements
of science, and frees them from the humiliating necessity to
accept the oracular teachings of “intelligences,” which as a rule have
less intelligence than a child at school. So based and so strengthened,
modern phenomena would be in a position to command the attention
and enforce the respect of those who carry with them public opinion.
Without invoking such help, spiritualism must continue to vegetate, equally
repulsed—not without cause—both by scientists and theologians. In
its modern aspect, it is neither a science, a religion, nor a philosophy.</p>

<p>Are we unjust; does any intelligent spiritualist complain that we have
misstated the case? To what can he point us but to a confusion of theories,
a tangle of hypotheses mutually contradictory? Can he affirm that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_637">637</a></span>
spiritualism, even with its thirty years of phenomena, has any defensible
philosophy; nay, that there is anything like an established method that
is generally accepted and followed by its recognized representatives?</p>

<p>And yet, there are many thoughtful, scholarly, earnest writers among
the spiritualists, scattered the world over. There are men who, in addition
to a scientific mental training and a reasoned faith in the phenomena
<i lang="la">per se</i>, possess all the requisites of leaders of the movement. How is
it then, that, except throwing off an isolated volume or so, or occasional
contributions to journalism, they all refrain from taking any active part
in the formation of a system of philosophy? This is from no lack of
moral courage, as their writings well show. Nor because of indifference,
for enthusiasm abounds, and they are sure of their facts. Nor is it from
lack of capacity, because many are men of mark, the peers of our best
minds. It is simply for the reason that, almost without exception, they
are bewildered by the contradictions they encounter, and wait for their
tentative hypotheses to be verified by further experience. Doubtless this
is the part of wisdom. It is that adopted by Newton, who, with the
heroism of an honest, unselfish heart, withheld for seventeen years the
promulgation of his theory of gravitation, only because he had not verified
it to his own satisfaction.</p>

<p>Spiritualism, whose aspect is rather that of aggression than of defense,
has tended toward iconoclasm, and so far has done well. But, in pulling
down, it does not rebuild. Every really substantial truth it erects is soon
buried under an avalanche of chimeras, until all are in one confused
ruin. At every step of advance, at the acquisition of every new vantage-ground
of <span class="smcap">Fact</span>, some cataclysm, either in the shape of fraud and exposure,
or of premeditated treachery, occurs, and throws the spiritualists
back powerless because they <em>cannot</em> and their invisible friends <em>will</em> not
(or perchance can, less than themselves) make good their claims. Their
fatal weakness is that they have but <em>one</em> theory to offer in explanation of
their challenged facts—the agency of <em>human disembodied spirits</em>, and the
medium’s complete subjection to them. They will attack those who differ
in views with them with a vehemence only warranted by a better
cause; they will regard every argument contradicting their theory as an
imputation upon their common sense and powers of observation; and
they will positively refuse even to argue the question.</p>

<p>How, then, can spiritualism be ever elevated to the distinction of
a science? This, as Professor Tyndall shows, includes three absolutely
necessary elements: observation of facts; induction of laws from these
facts; and verification of those laws by constant practical experience.
What experienced observer will maintain that spiritualism presents either
one of these three elements? The medium is not uniformly surrounded

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_638">638</a></span>
by such test conditions that we may be sure of the facts; the inductions
from the supposed facts are unwarranted in the absence of such verification;
and, as a corollary, there has been no sufficient verification of
those hypotheses by experience. In short, the prime element of accuracy
has, as a rule, been lacking.</p>

<p>That we may not be charged with desire to misrepresent the position
of spiritualism, at the date of this present writing, or accused of withholding
credit for advances actually made, we will cite a few passages from
the London <cite>Spiritualist</cite> of March 2, 1877. At the fortnightly meeting,
held February 19, a debate occurred upon the subject of “Ancient
Thought and Modern Spiritualism.” Some of the most intelligent Spiritualists
of England participated. Among these was Mr. W. Stainton
Moses, M.A., who has recently given some attention to the relation
between ancient and modern phenomena. He said: “Popular spiritualism
is not scientific; it does very little in the way of scientific verification.
Moreover, exoteric spiritualism is, to a large extent, devoted to
presumed communion with personal friends, or to the gratification of
curiosity, or the mere evolution of marvels.... The truly esoteric
science of spiritualism is very rare, and not more rare than valuable.
To it we must look to the origination of knowledge which may be developed
exoterically.... We proceed too much on the lines of the physicists;
our tests are crude, and often illusory; we know too little of the
Protean power of spirit. Here the ancients were far ahead of us, and
can teach us much. We have not introduced any certainty into the conditions—a
necessary prerequisite for true scientific experiment. This is
largely owing to the fact that our circles are constructed on no principle....
We have not even mastered the elementary truths which the ancients
knew and acted on, <i>e.g.</i>, the isolation of mediums. We have been so
occupied with wonder-hunting that we have hardly tabulated the phenomena,
or propounded one theory to account for the production of the
simplest of them.... We have never faced the question: What is the
intelligence? This is the great blot, the most frequent source of error,
and here we might learn with advantage from the ancients. There is
the strongest disinclination among spiritualists to admit the possibility
of the truth of occultism. In this respect they are as hard to convince
as is the outer world of spiritualism. Spiritualists start with a fallacy,
<abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>: that all phenomena are caused by the action of departed human
spirits; <em>they have not looked into the powers of the human spirit</em>; they
do not know the extent to which spirit acts, how far it reaches, what it
underlies.”</p>

<p>Our position could not be better defined. If Spiritualism has a
future; it is in the keeping of such men as Mr. Stainton Moses.</p>

<p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_639">639</a></span>
Our work is done—would that it were better done! But, despite
our inexperience in the art of book-making, and the serious difficulty of
writing in a foreign tongue, we hope we have succeeded in saying some
things that will remain in the minds of the thoughtful. The enemies of
truth have been all counted, and all passed in review. Modern science,
powerless to satisfy the aspirations of the race, makes the future a void,
and bereaves man of hope. In one sense, it is like the Baital Pachisi,
the Hindu vampire of popular fancy, which lives in dead bodies, and
feeds but on the rottenness of matter. The theology of Christendom has
been rubbed threadbare by the most serious minds of the day. It is
found to be, on the whole, subversive, rather than promotive of spirituality
and good morals. Instead of expounding the rules of divine law and
justice, it teaches but <em>itself</em>. In place of an ever-living Deity, it preaches
the Evil One, and makes him indistinguishable from God Himself!
“Lead us not into temptation” is the aspiration of Christians. Who,
then, is the tempter? Satan? No; the prayer is not addressed to him.
It is that tutelar genius who hardened the heart of Pharaoh, put an evil
spirit into Saul, sent lying messengers to the prophets, and tempted
David to sin; it is—the <cite>Bible</cite>-God of Israel!</p>

<p>Our examination of the multitudinous religious faiths that mankind,
early and late, have professed, most assuredly indicates that they have
all been derived from one primitive source. It would seem as if they
were all but different modes of expressing the yearning of the imprisoned
human soul for intercourse with supernal spheres. As the white ray of
light is decomposed by the prism into the various colors of the solar
spectrum, so the beam of divine truth, in passing through the <em>three-sided</em>
prism of man’s nature, has been broken up into vari-colored fragments
called <span class="allsmcap">RELIGIONS</span>. And, as the rays of the spectrum, by imperceptible
shadings, merge into each other, so the great theologies that have appeared
at different degrees of divergence from the original source, have
been connected by minor schisms, schools, and off-shoots from the one
side or the other. Combined, their aggregate represents one eternal
truth; separate, they are but shades of human error and the signs of
imperfection. The worship of the Vedic <i>pitris</i> is fast becoming the worship
of the spiritual portion of mankind. It but needs the right perception
of things objective to finally discover that the only world of reality
is the subjective.</p>

<p>What has been contemptuously termed Paganism, was ancient wisdom
replete with Deity; and Judaism and its offspring, Christianity and
Islamism, derived whatever of inspiration they contained from this ethnic
parent. Pre-Vedic Brahmanism and Buddhism are the double source
from which all religions sprung; Nirvana is the ocean to which all tend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_640">640</a></span>
For the purposes of a philosophical analysis, we need not take account
of the enormities which have blackened the record of many of the
world’s religions. True faith is the embodiment of divine charity;
those who minister at its altars, are but human. As we turn the bloodstained
pages of ecclesiastical history, we find that, whoever may have
been the hero, and whatever costumes the actors may have worn, the
plot of the tragedy has ever been the same. But the Eternal Night was
in and behind all, and we pass from what we see to that which is invisible
to the eye of sense. Our fervent wish has been to show true souls
how they may lift aside the curtain, and, in the brightness of that Night
made Day, look with undazzled gaze upon the <span class="smcap">Unveiled Truth</span>.</p>

 In the government of Tambov, a gentleman, a rich landed proprietor, had a curious
case happen in his family during the Hungarian campaign of 1848. His only and much-beloved
nephew, whom, having no children, he had adopted as a son, was in the Russian
army. The elderly couple had a portrait of his—a water-color painting—constantly,
during the meals, placed on the table in front of the young man’s usual seat. One
evening as the family, with some friends, were at their early tea, the glass over the portrait,
without any one touching it, was shattered to atoms with a loud explosion. As
the aunt of the young soldier caught the picture in her hand she saw the forehead and
head besmeared with blood. The guests, in order to quiet her, attributed the blood to
her having cut her fingers with the broken glass. But, examine as they would, they
could not find the vestige of a cut on her fingers, and no one had touched the picture but
herself. Alarmed at her state of excitement the husband, pretending to examine the
portrait more closely, cut his finger on purpose, and then tried to assure her that it was
his blood and that, in the first excitement, he had touched the frame without any one
remarking it. All was in vain, the old lady felt sure that Dimitry was killed. She
began to have masses said for him daily at the village church, and arrayed the whole
household in deep mourning. Several weeks later, an official communication was
received from the colonel of the regiment, stating that their nephew was killed by a
fragment of a shell which had carried off the upper part of his head.</p>

 Executions for witchcraft took place, not much later than a century ago, in other
of the American provinces. Notoriously there were negroes executed in New Jersey by
burning at the stake—the penalty denounced in several States. Even in South Carolina,
in 1865, when the State government was “reconstructed,” after the civil war, the
statutes inflicting death for witchcraft were found to be still unrepealed. It is not a
hundred years since they have been enforced to the murderous letter of their text.</p>

 There were two chairs of the titular apostle at Rome. The clergy, frightened at
the uninterrupted evidence furnished by scientific research, at last decided to confront
the enemy, and we find the <span lang="fr">“Chronique des Arts”</span> giving the cleverest, and at the same
time most <em>Jesuitical</em>, explanation of the fact. According to their story, “The <em>increase</em>
in the number of the faithful decided Peter upon making Rome henceforth the centre
of his action. The cemetery of Ostrianum was too distant and would <em>not suffice for
the reünions of the Christians</em>. The motive which had induced the Apostle to confer
on <em>Linus and Cletus</em> successively the episcopal character, in order to render them capable
of sharing the solicitudes of a church whose extent was to be without limits, led
naturally to a multiplication of the places of meeting. The particular residence of Peter
was therefore fixed at Viminal; and there was established that mysterious Chair, the
symbol of power and truth. The august seat which was venerated at the Ostrian Catacombs
was not, however, removed. Peter still visited this cradle of the Roman Church,
and often, without doubt, exercised his holy functions there. A <em>second</em> Chair, expressing
the same mystery as the first, was set up at Cornelia, and it is this which has come down
to us through the ages.”</p>

<p class="footnote">Now, so far from it being possible that there ever were two genuine chairs of this
kind, the majority of critics show that Peter never was at Rome at all; the reasons are
many and unanswerable. Perhaps we had best begin by pointing to the works of Justin
Martyr. This great champion of Christianity, writing in the early part of the second
century <em>in Rome</em>, where he fixed his abode, eager to get hold of the least proof in favor
of the truth for which he suffered, seems <em>perfectly unconscious of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter’s existence</em>!!</p>

<p class="footnote">Neither does any other writer of any consequence mention him in connection with
the Church of Rome, earlier than the days of Irenæus, when the latter set himself to
invent a new religion, drawn from the depths of his imagination. We refer the reader
anxious to learn more to the able work of Mr. George Reber, entitled “The Christ of
Paul.” The arguments of this author are conclusive. The above article in the <span lang="fr">“Chronique
des Arts,”</span> speaks of the <em>increase</em> of the faithful to such an extent that Ostrianum
could not contain the number of Christians. Now, if Peter was at Rome at all—runs
Mr. Reber’s argument—it must have been between the years <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> 64 and 69; for at
64 he was at Babylon, from whence he wrote epistles and letters to Rome, and at
some time between 64 and 68 (the reign of Nero) he either died a martyr or in his bed,
for Irenæus makes him deliver the Church of Rome, together with Paul (!?) (whom
he persecuted and quarrelled with all his life), into the hands of <em>Linus</em>, who became
bishop in 69 (see Reber’s “Christ of Paul,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 122). We will treat of it more fully in
chapter <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr></p>

<p class="footnote">Now, we ask, in the name of common sense, how could the <em>faithful</em> of Peter’s
Church <em>increase</em> at such a rate, when Nero trapped and killed them like so many
mice during his reign? History shows the few Christians fleeing from Rome, wherever
they could, to avoid the persecution of the emperor, and the <span lang="fr">“Chronique des Arts”</span>
makes them increase and multiply! “Christ,” the article goes on to say, “willed that
this visible sign of the doctrinal authority of his vicar should also have its portion of
immortality; one can follow it from age to age in the documents of the Roman Church.”
Tertullian formally attests its existence in his book <span lang="la">“De Præscriptionibus.”</span> Eager to
learn everything concerning so interesting a subject, we would like to be shown when
did <em>Christ</em> <span class="allsmcap">WILL</span> anything of the kind? However: “Ornaments of ivory have been fitted
to the front and back of the chair, but only on those parts repaired with acacia-wood.
Those which cover the panel in front are divided into three superimposed rows, each
containing six plaques of ivory, on which are engraved various subjects, among others the
‘Labors of Hercules.’ Several of the plaques were wrongly placed, and seemed to have
been affixed to the chair at a time when the remains of antiquity were employed as ornaments,
without much regard to fitness.” This is the point. The article was written
simply as a clever answer to several facts published during the present century. Bower,
in his “History of the Popes” (<abbr title="volume two">vol. <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr></abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7), narrates that in the year 1662, while cleaning
one of the chairs, “the ‘Twelve Labors of Hercules’ unluckily appeared engraved upon it,”
after which the chair was removed and another substituted. But in 1795, when Bonaparte’s
troops occupied Rome, the chair was again examined. This time there was
found the Mahometan confession of faith, in Arabic letters: “There is no Deity
but Allah, and Mahomet is his Apostle.” (See appendix to “Ancient Symbol-Worship,”
by H. M. Westropp and C. Staniland Wake.) In the appendix <abbr title="Professor">Prof.</abbr> Alexander
Wilder very justly remarks as follows: “We presume that the Apostle of the Circumcision,
as Paul, his great rival, styles him, was never at the Imperial City, nor had a
successor there, not even in the ghetto. The ‘Chair of Peter,’ therefore, is <em>sacred</em>
rather than apostolical. Its sanctity proceeded, however, from the esoteric religion of
the former times of Rome. The hierophant of the Mysteries probably occupied it on
the day of initiations, when exhibiting to the candidates the <i lang="la">Petroma</i> (stone tablet
containing the last revelation made by the hierophant to the neophyte for initiation).”</p>

 One of the most surprising facts that have come under our observation, is that
students of profound research should not couple the frequent recurrence of these “unexpected
and almost miraculous” discoveries of important documents, at the most opportune
moments, with a premeditated design. Is it so strange that the custodians of
“Pagan” lore, seeing that the proper moment had arrived, should cause the needed
document, book, or relic to fall as if by accident in the right man’s way? Geological
surveyors and explorers even as competent as Humboldt and Tschuddi, have not discovered
the hidden mines from which the Peruvian Incas dug their treasure, although
the latter confesses that the present degenerate Indians have the secret. In 1839, Perring,
the archæologist, proposed to the sheik of an Arab village two purses of gold, if he
helped him to discover the entrance to the hidden passage leading to the sepulchral
chambers in the North Pyramid of Doshoor. But though his men were out of employment
and half-starved, the sheik proudly refused to “sell the secret of the dead,”
promising to show it <i lang="la">gratis</i>, when <em>the time would come for it</em>. Is it, then, impossible
that in some other regions of the earth are guarded the remains of that glorious literature
of the past, which was the fruit of its majestic civilization? What is there so surprising
in the idea? Who knows but that as the Christian Church has unconsciously
begotten free thought by reaction against her own cruelty, rapacity, and dogmatism, the
public mind may be glad to follow the lead of the Orientalists, away from Jerusalem
and towards Ellora; and that then much more will be discovered that is now hidden?</p>

 An after-thought has made us fancy that we can understand what is meant by the
following sentences of <cite>Moses of Chorenè</cite>: “The ancient Asiatics,” says he, “five
centuries before our era—and especially the Hindus, the Persians, and the Chaldeans,
had in their possession a quantity of historical and scientific books. These works
were partially borrowed, partially translated in the Greek language, mostly since the
Ptolemies had established the Alexandrian library and encouraged the writers by their
liberalities, so that the Greek language became the deposit of all the sciences”
(“History of Armenia”). Therefore, the greater part of the literature included in
the 700,000 volumes of the Alexandrian Library was due to India, and her next
neighbors.</p>

 There is a wide-spread <em>superstition</em> (?), especially among the Slavonians and Russians,
that the <em>magician</em> or wizard cannot die before he has passed the “word” to a
successor. So deeply is it rooted among the popular beliefs, that we do not imagine
there is a person in Russia who has not heard of it. It is but too easy to trace the
origin of this superstition to the old Mysteries which had been for ages spread all over
the globe. The ancient <i>Variago-Rouss</i> had his Mysteries in the North as well as in
the South of Russia; and there are many relics of the by-gone faith scattered in the
lands watered by the sacred Dnieper, the baptismal Jordan of all Russia. No <i>Znâchar</i>
(the knowing one) or <i>Koldoun</i> (sorcerer), male or female, can die in fact before he has
passed the mysterious word to some one. The popular belief is that unless he does that
he will linger and suffer for weeks and months, and were he even finally to get liberated,
it would be only to wander on earth, unable to quit its region unless he finds a successor
even after death. How far the belief may be verified by others, we do not know, but
we have seen a case which, for its tragical and mysterious <i lang="fr">dénoument</i>, deserves to be given
here as an illustration of the subject in hand. An old man, of over one hundred years
of age, a peasant-serf in the government of S——, having a wide reputation as a sorcerer
and healer, was said to be dying for several days, and still unable to die. The report
spread like lightning, and the poor old fellow was shunned by even the members of his
own family, as the latter were afraid of receiving the unwelcome inheritance. At last
the public rumor in the village was that he had sent a message to a colleague less versed
than himself in the art, and who, although he lived in a distant district, was nevertheless
coming at the call, and would be on hand early on the following morning. There was
at that time on a visit to the proprietor of the village a young physician who, belonging
to the famous school of <i>Nihilism</i> of that day, laughed outrageously at the idea. The
master of the house, being a very pious man, and but half inclined to make so cheap
of the “superstition,” smiled—as the saying goes—but with one corner of his mouth.
Meanwhile the young skeptic, to gratify his curiosity, had made a visit to the dying
man, had found that he could not live twenty-four hours longer, and, determined to
prove the absurdity of the “superstition,” had taken means to detain the coming “successor”
at a neighboring village.</p>

<p class="footnote">Early in the morning a company of four persons, comprising the physician, the master
of the place, his daughter, and the writer of the present lines, went to the hut in
which was to be achieved the triumph of skepticism. The dying man was expecting his
liberator every moment, and his agony at the delay became extreme. We tried to persuade
the physician to humor the patient, were it for humanity’s sake. He only laughed.
Getting hold with one hand of the old wizard’s pulse, he took out his watch with the
other, and remarking in French that all would be over in a few moments, remained absorbed
in his professional experiment. The scene was solemn and appalling. Suddenly
the door opened, and a young boy entered with the intelligence, addressed to the doctor,
that the <i>koum</i> was lying dead drunk at a neighboring village, and, according to <em>his
orders</em>, could not be with “grandfather” till the next day. The young doctor felt
confused, and was just going to address the old man, when, as quick as lightning, the
Znâchar snatched his hand from his grasp and raised himself in bed. His deep-sunken
eyes flashed; his yellow-white beard and hair streaming round his livid face made him a
dreadful sight. One instant more, and his long, sinewy arms were clasped round the
physician’s neck, as with a supernatural force he drew the doctor’s head closer and closer
to his own face, where he held him as in a vise, while <em>whispering</em> words inaudible to us
in his ear. The skeptic struggled to free himself, but before he had time to make one
effective motion the work had evidently been done; the hands relaxed their grasp, and
the old sorcerer fell on his back—a corpse! A strange and ghostly smile had settled on
the stony lips—a smile of fiendish triumph and satisfied revenge; but the doctor looked
paler and more ghastly than the dead man himself. He stared round with an expression
of terror difficult to describe, and without answering our inquiries rushed out wildly from
the hut, in the direction of the woods. Messengers were sent after him, but he was
nowhere to be found. About sunset a report was heard in the forest. An hour later
his body was brought home, with a bullet through his head, for the skeptic had blown
out his brains!</p>

<p class="footnote">What made him commit suicide? What magic spell of sorcery had the “word” of
the dying wizard left on his mind? Who can tell?</p>

 Jacolliot seems to have very logically demonstrated the absurd contradictions of
some philologists, anthropologists, and Orientalists, in regard to their <i>Akkado

he writes. “The scientists who invent Turanian peoples know very well that in <cite>Manu</cite>
alone, there is more of veritable science and philosophy than in all that this pretended
Semitism has hitherto furnished us with; but they are the slaves of a path which some
of them are following the last fifteen, twenty, or even thirty years.... We expect,
therefore, nothing of the present. India will owe its reconstitution to the scientists of

 We have the facts from a trustworthy witness, having no interest to invent such a
story. Having injured his leg in a fall from the steamer into the boat in which he was
to land at the Mount, he was taken care of by these monks, and during his convalescence,
through gifts of money and presents, became their greatest friend, and finally won their
entire confidence. Having asked for the loan of some books, he was taken by the Superior
to a large cellar in which they keep their sacred vessels and other property. Opening
a great trunk, full of old musty manuscripts and rolls, he was invited by the Superior
to “<em>amuse</em> himself.” The gentleman was a scholar, and well versed in Greek and Latin
text. “I was amazed,” he says, in a private letter, “and had my breath taken away,
on finding among these old parchments, so unceremoniously treated, some of the most
valuable relics of the first centuries, hitherto believed to have been lost.” Among others
he found a half-destroyed manuscript, which he is perfectly sure must be a copy of the
“True Doctrine,” the Λόγος ἀληθής of Celsus, out of which Origen quoted whole pages.
The traveller took as many notes as he could on that day, but when he came to offer to the
Superior to purchase some of these writings he found, to his great surprise, that no amount
of money would tempt the monks. They did not know what the manuscripts contained,
nor “did they care,” they said. But the “heap of writing,” they added, was transmitted
to them from one generation to another, and there was a tradition among them that
these papers would one day become the means of crushing the “Great Beast of the
Apocalypse,” their hereditary enemy, the Church of Rome. They were constantly
quarrelling and fighting with the Catholic monks, and among the whole “heap” they
<em>knew</em> that there was a “holy” relic which protected them. They did not know <em>which</em>,
and so in their doubt abstained. It appears that the Superior, a shrewd Greek, understood
his <i>bevue</i> and repented of his kindness, for first of all he made the traveller give
him his most sacred word of honor, strengthened by an oath he made him take on the
image of the Holy Patroness of the Island, never to betray their secret, and never mention,
at least, the name of their convent. And finally, when the anxious student who
had passed a fortnight in reading all sorts of antiquated trash before he happened to
stumble over some precious manuscript, expressed the desire to have the key, to “amuse
himself” with the writings once more, he was very <em>naïvely</em> informed that the “key had
been lost,” and that they did not know where to look for it. And thus he was left to
the few notes he had taken.</p>

 We beg the reader to bear in mind that it is the same Cyril who was accused and
proved guilty of having sold the gold and silver ornaments of his church, and spent the
money. He pleaded guilty, but tried to excuse himself on the ground that he had used
the money for the poor, but could not give evidence of it. His duplicity with Arius
and his party is well known. Thus one of the first Christian saints, and the founder
of the Trinity, appears on the pages of history as a murderer and a thief!</p>

 A correspondent of the London “Times” describes the Catalonian exorcist in the
following lines:</p>

<p class="footnote">“About the 14th of October it was privately announced that a young woman of
seventeen or eighteen years of age, of the lower class, having long been afflicted with
‘a hatred of holy things,’ the senior priest of the Church of the Holy Spirit would cure
her of her disease. The exhibition was to be held in a church frequented by the best
part of the community. The church was dark, but a sickly light was shed by wax
lights on the sable forms of some eighty or a hundred persons who clustered round the
<i>presbyterio</i>, or sanctuary, in front of the altar. Within the little enclosure or sanctuary,
separated from the crowd by a light railing, lay, on a common bench, with a little
pillow for her head to recline upon, a poorly-clad girl, probably of the peasant or artisan
class; her brother or husband stood at her feet to restrain her (at times) frantic
kicking by holding her legs. The door of the vestry opened; the exhibitor—I mean
the priest—came in. The poor girl, not without just reason, ‘had an aversion to holy
things,’ or, at least, the 400 devils within her distorted body had such an aversion, and
in the confusion of the moment, thinking that the father was ‘a holy thing,’ she doubled
up her legs, screamed out with twitching mouth, her whole body writhing, and threw herself
nearly off the bench. The male attendant seized her legs, the women supported her
head and swept out her dishevelled hair. The priest advanced and, mingling familiarly
with the shuddering and horror-struck crowd, said, pointing at the suffering child,
now sobbing and twitching on the bench, ‘Promise me, my children, that you will be
prudent (<i>prudentes</i>), and of a truth, sons and daughters mine, you shall see marvels.’
The promise was given. The exhibitor went to procure stole and short surplice (<i>estola
y roquete</i>), and returned in a moment, taking his stand at the side of the ‘possessed
with the devils,’ with his face toward the group of students. The order of the day’s
proceedings was a lecture to the bystanders, and the operation of exorcising the devils.
‘You know,’ said the priest, ‘that so great is this girl’s aversion to holy things, myself
included, that she goes into convulsions, kicks, screams, and distorts her body the moment
she arrives at the corner of this street, and her convulsive struggles reach their
climax when she enters the sacred house of the Most High.’ Turning to the prostrate,
shuddering, most unhappy object of his attack, the priest commenced: ‘In the name of
God, of the saints, of the blessed Host, of every holy sacrament of our Church, I adjure
thee, Rusbel, come out of her.’ (<abbr title="nota bene">N. B.</abbr> ‘Rusbel’ is the name of a devil, the devil having
257 names in Catalonia.) Thus adjured, the girl threw herself—in an agony of convulsion,
till her distorted face, foam-bespattered lips and writhing limbs grew well-nigh
stiff—at full length upon the floor, and, in language semi-obscene, semi-violent, screamed
out, ‘I don’t choose to come out, you thieves, scamps, robbers.’ At last, from the
quivering lips of the girl, came the words, ‘I will;’ but the devil added, with traditional
perversity, ‘I will cast the 100 out, but by the mouth of the girl.’ The priest
objected. The exit, he said, of 100 devils out of the small Spanish mouth of the woman
would ‘leave her suffocated.’ Then the maddened girl said she must undress herself
for the devils to escape. This petition the holy father refused. ‘Then I will come
out through the right foot, but first’—the girl had on a hempen sandal, she was obviously
of the poorest class—‘you must take off her sandal.’ The sandal was untied;
the foot gave a convulsive plunge; the devil and his myrmidons (so the <i>cura</i> said,
looking round triumphantly) had gone to their own place. And, assured of this, the
wretched dupe of a girl lay quite still. The bishop was not cognizant of this freak of
the clergy, and the moment it came to the ears of the civil authorities, the sharpest
means were taken to prevent a repetition of the scandal.”</p>

 Neither do we, if by <em>true religion</em> the world shall at last understand the adoration of
one Supreme, Invisible, and Unknown Deity, by works and acts, not by the profession
of vain human dogmas. But our intention is to go farther. We desire to demonstrate
that if we exclude ceremonial and fetish worship from being regarded as essential parts
of religion, then the true Christ-like principles have been exemplified, and true Christianity
practiced since the days of the apostles, exclusively among Buddhists and
“heathen.”</p>

 In its most extensive meaning, the Sanscrit word has the same literal sense as the
Greek term; both imply “revelation,” by no human agent, but through the “receiving
of the sacred drink.” In India the initiated received the “Soma,” sacred drink, which
helped to liberate his soul from the body; and in the Eleusinian Mysteries it was the
sacred drink offered at the Epopteia. The Grecian Mysteries are wholly derived from
the Brahmanical Vedic rites, and the latter from the ante-vedic religious Mysteries—primitive
Buddhist philosophy.</p>

 The fact that Peter persecuted the “Apostle to the Gentiles,” under that name,
does not necessarily imply that there was no Simon Magus individually distinct from
Paul. It may have become a generic name of abuse. Theodoret and Chrysostom, the
earliest and most prolific commentators on the Gnosticism of those days, seem actually
to make of Simon a rival of Paul, and to state that between them passed frequent messages.
The former, as a diligent propagandist of what Paul terms the “antitheses of
the Gnosis” (1st Epistle to Timothy), must have been a sore thorn in the side of the
apostle. There are sufficient proofs of the actual existence of Simon Magus.</p>

 This expression must not be understood literally; for as in the initiation of certain
Brotherhoods it has a secret meaning, hinted at by Pythagoras, when he describes his
feelings after the initiation and tells that he was crowned by the gods in whose presence
he had drunk “the waters of life”—in Hindu, <i>â-bi-hayât</i>, fount of life.</p>

 This original and very long sermon was preached in a church at Brooklyn, <abbr title="New York"><abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr></abbr>,
on the 15th day of April, 1877. On the following morning, the reverend orator was
called in the “Sun” a gibbering charlatan; but this deserved epithet will not prevent
other reverend buffoons doing the same and even worse. And this is the religion of
Christ! Far better disbelieve in him altogether than caricature one’s God in such a
manner. We heartily applaud the “Sun” for the following views: “And then when
Talmage makes Christ say to Martha in the tantrums: ‘Don’t worry, but sit down on
this ottoman,’ he adds the climax to a scene that the inspired writers had nothing to
say about. Talmage’s buffoonery is going too far. If he were the worst heretic in
the land, instead of being straight in his orthodoxy, he would not do so much evil to
religion as he does by his familiar blasphemies.”</p>

 Illustrated figures “from an ancient Rosary of the blessed Virgin Mary, printed at
Venice, 1524, with a license from the Inquisition.” In the illustrations given by Dr.
Inman the Virgin is represented in an Assyrian “grove,” the <em>abomination in the eyes
of the Lord</em>, according to the Bible prophets. “The book in question,” says the author,
“contains numerous figures, all resembling closely the Mesopotamian emblem of <i>Ishtar</i>.
The presence of the woman <em>therein</em> identifies the two as symbolic of Isis, or <i lang="fr">la nature</i>;
and a man bowing down in adoration thereof shows the same idea as is depicted in
Assyrian sculptures, where males offer to the goddess <em>symbols</em> of <em>themselves</em>” (See

 The body of man—his coat of skin—is an inert mass of matter, <i lang="la">per se</i>; it is but
the <em>sentient</em> living body within the man that is considered as the man’s body proper,
and it is that which, together with the fontal soul or purely astral body, directly connected
with the immortal spirit, constitutes the trinity of man.</p>

 We really think that the word “witchcraft” ought, once for all, to be understood
in the sense which properly belongs to it. Witchcraft may be either conscious or unconscious.
Certain wicked and dangerous results may be obtained through the mesmeric
powers of a so-called sorcerer, who misuses his potential fluid; or again they may be
achieved through an easy access of malicious tricky “spirits” (so much the worse if
human) to the atmosphere surrounding a medium. How many thousands of such irresponsible
innocent victims have met infamous deaths through the tricks of those Elementaries!</p>

 It appears that the Jews attribute a very high antiquity to “Sepher Toldos
Jeshu.” It was mentioned for the first time by Martin, about the beginning of the
thirteenth century, for the Talmudists took great care to conceal it from the Christians.
Levi says that Porchetus Salvaticus published some portions of it, which were used by
Luther (see <abbr title="volume eight">vol. viii.</abbr>, Jena <abbr title="Edition">Ed.</abbr>).
 The Hebrew text, which was missing, was at last
found by Münster and Buxtorf, and published in 1681, by Christopher Wagenseilius,
in Nuremberg, and in Frankfort, in a collection entitled <span lang="la">“Tela Ignea Satanæ,”</span> or

 The statement, if reliable, would show that Jesus was between fifty and sixty years
old when baptized; for the Gospels make him but a few months younger than John.
The kabalists say that Jesus was over forty years old when first appearing at the gates
of Jerusalem. The present copy of the “Codex Nazaræus” is dated in the year 1042,
but Dunlap finds in Irenæus (2d century) quotations from and ample references to this
book. “The basis of the material common to Irenæus and the “Codex Nazaræus”
must be at least as early as the first century,” says the author in his preface to “Sod,

 In relation to the well-known fact of Jesus wearing his hair long, and being always
so represented, it becomes quite startling to find how little the unknown Editor of the
“Acts” knew about the Apostle Paul, since he makes him say in 1 Corinthians <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr> 14,
“Doth not Nature itself teach you, that if a <em>man have long hair, it is a shame unto
him</em>?” Certainly Paul could never have said such a thing! Therefore, if the passage
is genuine, Paul knew nothing of the prophet whose doctrines he had embraced
and for which he died; and if false—how much more reliable is what remains?</p>

 Max Müller has sufficiently proved the case in his lecture on the “Zend-Avesta.”
He calls Gushtasp “the mythical pupil of Zoroaster.” Mythical, perhaps, only because
the period in which he lived and learned with Zoroaster is too remote to allow
our modern science to speculate upon it with any certainty.</p>

 The real meaning of the division into <em>ages</em> is esoteric and Buddhistic. So little
did the uninitiated Christians understand it that they accepted the words of Jesus <em>literally</em>
and firmly believed that he meant the end of the world. There had been many
prophecies about the forthcoming age. Virgil, in the fourth Eclogue, mentions the
Metatron—a new offspring, with whom the <em>iron age</em> shall end and a <em>golden one</em> arise.</p>

 “The profound or esoteric doctrines of the ancients were denominated <em>wisdom</em>,

them with a golden bodkin, but religious superstition. The Jewish astrologers

 We believe that it was the Sadducees and not the Pharisees who crucified Jesus.
They were Zadokites—partisans of the house of Zadok, or the sacerdotal family. In
the “Acts” the apostles were said to be persecuted by the Sadducees, but never by the
Pharisees. In fact, the latter never persecuted any one. They had the scribes, rabbis,
and learned men in their numbers, and were not, like the Sadducees, jealous of their
order.</p>

 The five make mystically ten. They are androgynes. “Having divided his body in
two parts, the Supreme Wisdom became male and female” (“Manu,” book <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, sloka
32). There are many early Buddhistic ideas to be found in Brahmanism.</p>

<p class="footnote">The prevalent idea that the last of the Buddhas, Gautama, is the ninth incarnation
of Vishnu, or the <em>ninth</em> Avatar, is disclaimed partially by the Brahmans, and wholly
rejected by the learned Buddhist theologians. The latter insist that the worship of
Buddha possesses a far higher claim to antiquity than any of the Brahmanical deities of
the <cite>Vedas</cite>, which they call secular literature. The Brahmans, they show, came from
other countries, and established their heresy on the already accepted popular <em>deities</em>.
They conquered the land by the sword, and succeeded in burying truth, by building a
theology of their own on the ruins of the more ancient one of Buddha, which had
prevailed for ages. They admit the divinity and spiritual existence of some of the
Vedantic gods; but as in the case of the Christian angel-hierarchy they believe that
all these deities are greatly subordinate, even to the incarnated Buddhas. They do not
even acknowledge the creation of the physical universe. Spiritually and <em>invisibly</em> it has
existed from all eternity, and thus it was made merely visible to the human senses.
When it first appeared it was called forth from the realm of the invisible into the visible
by the impulse of A’di Buddha—the “Essence.” They reckon twenty-two such visible
appearances of the universe governed by Buddhas, and as many destructions of it, by
fire and water in regular successions. After the last destruction by the flood, at the end
of the precedent cycle—(the exact calculation, embracing several millions of years, is a
secret cycle) the world, during the present age of the Kali Yug—Maha Bhadda Calpa—has
been ruled successively by four Buddhas, the last of whom was Gautama, the
“Holy One.” The fifth, Maitree-Buddha, is yet to come. This latter is the expected
kabalistic King Messiah, the Messenger of Light, and Sosiosh, the Persian Saviour,
who will come on a <em>white</em> horse. It is also the Christian Second Advent. See
“Apocalypse” of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John.</p>

 In his debate with Jacolliot upon the right spelling of the Hindu Christna, Mr.
Textor de Ravisi, an ultramontane Catholic, tries to prove that the name of Christna
ought to be written Krishna, for, as the latter means black, and the statues of this
deity are generally black, the word is derived from the color. We refer the reader to
Jacolliot’s answer in his recent work, “Christna et le Christ,” for the conclusive evidence
that the name is not derived from the color.</p>

 There is no equivalent for the word “miracle,” in the Christian sense, among the
Brahmans or Buddhists. The only correct translation would be <i>meipo</i>, a wonder, something
remarkable; but not a violation of natural law. The “saints” only produce
<i>meipo</i>.</p>

 This author, <abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 103, remarks with great justice of the “Heresiarch”
Marcion, “whose high personal character exerted so powerful an influence upon his own
time,” that “it was the misfortune of Marcion to live in an age when Christianity had
passed out of the pure morality of its infancy; when, untroubled by complicated questions
of dogma, simple faith and pious enthusiasm had been the one great bond of
Christian brotherhood, into a phase of ecclesiastical development in which religion was
fast degenerating into theology, and complicated doctrines were rapidly assuming the
rampant attitude which led to so much bitterness, persecution, and schism. In later
times Marcion might have been honored as a reformer, in his own he was denounced as
a heretic. Austere and ascetic in his opinions, he aimed at superhuman purity, and,
although his clerical adversaries might scoff at his impracticable doctrines regarding
marriage and the subjugation of the flesh, they have had their parallels amongst those
whom the Church has since most delighted to honor, and, at least, the whole tendency
of his system was markedly towards the side of virtue.” These statements are based
upon Credner’s “Beiträge,” <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 40;

 But, on the other hand, this antagonism is very <em>strongly</em> marked in the “Clementine
Homilies,” in which Peter unequivocally denies that Paul, whom he calls Simon the
Magician, has ever had a <em>vision</em> of Christ, and calls him “an enemy.” Canon Westcott
says: “There can be no doubt that <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul is referred to as ‘the enemy’” (“On
the Canon,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 252, note 2; “Supernatural Religion,” <abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>, p 35). But this antagonism,
which rages unto the present day, we find even in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul’s “Epistles.” What
can be more energetic than such like sentences: “Such are <em>false</em> apostles, deceitful
workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.... I suppose I was
not a whit behind the very chiefest apostle” (2 Corinthians, <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>). “Paul, an apostle
<em>not of men</em>, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ <em>and</em> God the Father, who raised him
from the dead ... but there be some that trouble you, and <em>would pervert</em> the Gospel
of Christ ... <em>false brethren</em>.... When Peter came to Antioch I withstood him to
his face, because he was to be blamed. For before that certain came from James, <em>he did
eat</em> with the Gentiles, but when they were come he withdrew, fearing them which were of
the circumcision. And the other Jews dissembled ... insomuch that Barnabas also was
carried away with their <em>dissimulation</em>,” etc., etc. (<abbr title="Galatians one and two">Galat. <abbr title="one">i.</abbr> and <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr></abbr>). On the other hand, we
find Peter in the “Homilies,” indulging in various complaints which, although alleged
to be addressed to Simon Magus, are evidently all direct answers to the above-quoted
sentences from the Pauline Epistles, and <em>cannot</em> have anything to do with Simon. So,
for instance, Peter said: “For some among the Gentiles have rejected my lawful
preaching, and accepted certain <em>lawless</em> and <em>foolish</em> teaching of the hostile men (enemy)”—<abbr title="Epistle">Epist.</abbr>
of Peter to James, <abbr title="Section">§</abbr> 2. He says further: “Simon (Paul) ... who came
before me to the Gentiles ... and I have followed him as light upon darkness, as
knowledge upon ignorance, as health upon disease” (“<abbr title="Homily">Homil.</abbr>,” <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 17). Still further,
he calls him <em>Death</em> and a <em>deceiver</em> (Ibid., <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 18). He warns the Gentiles that “our Lord
and <em>Prophet</em> (<em>?</em>) (<em>Jesus</em>) announced that he would send from among his followers, apostles
to <em>deceive</em>. “Therefore, above all, remember to avoid every apostle, or teacher,
or prophet, who first does not accurately compare his teaching with that of James,
called the brother of our Lord” (see the difference between Paul and James on <em>faith</em>,
<abbr title="Epistle">Epist.</abbr> to Hebrews, <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>, <abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr>, and
<abbr title="Epistle">Epist.</abbr>. of James, <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>). “Lest the Evil One should send
a false preacher ... as he has sent to us Simon (?) preaching a counterfeit of truth in
the name of our Lord, and disseminating error” (<abbr title="Homilies">“Hom.”</abbr> <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>, 35; see above quotation
from <abbr title="Galatians">Gal.</abbr> 1, 5). He then denies Paul’s assertion, in the following words: “If, therefore,
our Jesus indeed appeared in a vision to you, it was only as an irritated adversary....
But how can any one through visions become wise in teaching? And if you say,
‘it is possible,’ then I ask, wherefore did the Teacher remain for a whole year and discourse
to those who were attentive? And how can <em>we believe your story that he
appeared to you</em>? And in what manner did he appear to you, when you hold opinions
contrary to his teaching?... For you now set yourself up against me, who am a
<em>firm rock, the foundation of the Church</em>. If you were not an opponent, you would
not calumniate me, you would not revile my teaching ... (circumcision?) in order that,
in declaring what I have myself heard from the Lord, I may not be believed, as though <em>I
were condemned</em>.... But if you say that I am condemned, you blame God who
revealed Christ to me.” “This last phrase,” observes the author of “Supernatural
Religion,” “‘if you say that I am condemned,’ is an evident allusion to <abbr title="Galatians two">Galat. ii</abbr>, 11,
‘I withstood him to the face, because he was condemned’” (“Supernatural Religion,”
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 37). “There cannot be a doubt,” adds the just-quoted author, “that the Apostle
Paul is attacked in this religious romance as the great enemy of the true faith, under
the hated name of Simon the Magician, whom Peter follows everywhere for the purpose
of unmasking and confuting him” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 34). And if so, then we must believe
that it was <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul who broke both his legs in Rome when flying in the air.</p>

 Emmanuel was doubtless the son of the prophet himself, as described in the sixth
chapter; what was predicted, can only be interpreted on that hypothesis. The prophet
had also announced to Ahaz the extinction of his line. “If ye will not believe, surely
ye shall not be established.” Next comes the prediction of the placing of a new prince
on the throne—Hezekiah of Bethlehem, said to have been Isaiah’s son-in-law, under
whom the captives should return from the uttermost parts of the earth. Assyria should
be humbled, and peace overspread the Israelitish country, compare Isaiah <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr> 14-16;
<abbr title="eight">viii.</abbr> 3, 4; <abbr title="nine">ix.</abbr> 6, 7;
 <abbr title="ten">x.</abbr> 12, 20, 21; <abbr title="eleven">xi.</abbr>; Micah
 <abbr title="five">v.</abbr>, 2-7. The popular party, the
party of the prophets, always opposed to the Zadokite priesthood, had resolved to set
aside Ahaz and his time-serving policy, which had let in Assyria upon Palestine, and to
set up Hezekiah, a man of their own, who should rebel against Assyria and overthrow
the Assur-worship and Baalim (2 Kings <abbr title="fifteen">xv.</abbr> 11). Though only the prophets hint
this, it being cut out from the historical books, it is noticeable that Ahaz offered his
own child to Moloch, also that he died at the age of thirty-six, and Hezekiah took the
throne at twenty-five, in full adult age.</p>

 The term “Paganism” is properly used by many modern writers with hesitation.
Professor Alexander Wilder, in his edition of Payne Knight’s “Symbolical Language of
Ancient Art and Mythology,” says: “It (‘Paganism’) has degenerated into slang, and
is generally employed with more or less of an opprobrious meaning. The correcter
expression would have been ‘the ancient ethnical worships,’ but it would be hardly
understood in its true sense, and we accordingly have adopted the term in popular use,
but not disrespectfully. A religion which can develop a Plato, an Epictetus, and an
Anaxagoras, is not gross, superficial, or totally unworthy of candid attention. Besides,
many of the rites and doctrines included in the Christian as well as in the Jewish Institute,
appeared first in the other systems. Zoroastrianism anticipated far more than has
been imagined. The cross, the priestly robes and symbols, the sacraments, the Sabbath,
the festivals and anniversaries, are all anterior to the Christian era by thousands of
years. The ancient worship, after it had been excluded from its former shrines, and
from the metropolitan towns, was maintained for a long time by the inhabitants of
humble localities. To this fact it owes its later designation. From being kept up in
the <i>Pagi</i>, or rural districts, its votaries were denominated <i>Pagans</i>, or provincials.”</p>

 This accounts also for the rejection of the works of Justin Martyr, who used only
this “Gospel according to the Hebrews,” as also did most probably Titian, his disciple.
At what late period was fully established the <em>divinity</em> of Christ we can judge by the mere
fact that even in the fourth century Eusebius did not denounce this book as spurious,
but only classed it with such as the Apocalypse of John; and Credner (<span lang="de">“Zur <abbr title="Geschichte">Gesch.</abbr>
Des <abbr title="Kanons">Kan.</abbr>,”</span> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 120) shows Nicephorus inserting it, together with the Revelation, in his
“Stichometry,” among the Antilegomena. The Ebionites, the <em>genuine</em> primitive Christians,
rejecting the rest of the apostolic writings, made use only of this Gospel (“<abbr title="Adversus Hæreses">Adv.
Hær.”</abbr> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, 26), and the Ebionites, as Epiphanius declares, firmly believed, with the
Nazarenes, that Jesus was but a man “of the seed of a man.”</p>

 Iurbo and Adunai, according to the Ophites, are names of Iao-Jehovah, one of the

 In the “Gospel of Nicodemus,” Ilda-Baoth is called <em>Satan</em> by the pious and anonymous
author;—evidently, one of the final flings at the half-crushed enemy. “As for
me,” says Satan, excusing himself to the prince of hell, “I tempted him (Jesus), and
stirred up my old people, the Jews, against him” (<abbr title="chapter fifteen">chap. xv.</abbr> 9). Of all examples of
Christian ingratitude this seems almost the most conspicuous. The poor Jews are first
robbed of their sacred books, and then, in a spurious “Gospel,” are insulted by the representation
of Satan claiming them as his “old people.” If they were his people, and at
the same time are “God’s chosen people,” then the name of this God must be written
Satan and not Jehovah. This is logic, but we doubt if it can be regarded as complimentary
to the “Lord God of Israel.”</p>

 This is the Nazarene system; the Spiritus, after uniting herself with Karabtanos
(<em>matter</em>, turbulent and senseless), brings forth <em>seven badly-disposed stellars</em>, in the Orcus;
“Seven Figures,” which she bore “witless” (“Codex Nazaræus,” <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>,
 <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 118). Justin
Martyr evidently adopts this idea, for he tells us of “the sacred prophets, who say that
one and the same <em>spirit</em> is divided into <em>seven</em> spirits (pneumata). “Justin ad Græcos;”
“Sod,” <abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 52. In
 the Apocalypse the Holy Spirit is subdivided into “<em>seven</em>
spirits before the throne,” from the Persian Mithraic mode of classifying.</p>

 His polemical work addressed against the so-called orthodox Church—the Catholic—notwithstanding
its bitterness and usual style of vituperation, is far more fair, considering
that the “great African” is said to have been expelled from the Church of
Rome. If we believe <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Jerome, it is but the envy and the unmerited calumnies of
the early Roman clergy against Tertullian which forced him to renounce the Catholic
Church and become a Montanist. However, were the unlimited admiration of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Cyprian, who terms Tertullian “The Master,” and his estimate of him merited, we
would see less error and paganism in the Church of Rome. The expression of Vincent
of Lerius, “that every word of Tertullian was a sentence, and every sentence a
triumph <em>over error</em>,” does not seem very happy when we think of the respect paid
to Tertullian by the Church of Rome, notwithstanding his partial apostasy and the
<em>errors</em> in which the latter still abides and has even enforced upon the world as <em>infallible</em>
dogmas.</p>

 It is the correct interpretation of the Bible allegories that makes the Catholic
clergy so wrathful with the Protestants who freely scrutinize the Bible. How
bitter this feeling has become, we can judge by the following words of the Reverend
Father Parker of Hyde Park, New York, who, lecturing in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Teresa’s Catholic
Church, on the 10th of December, 1876, said: “To whom does the Protestant
Church owe its possession of the Bible, <cite>which they wish to place in the hands of every
ignorant person and child</cite>? To monkish hands, that laboriously transcribed it before
the age of printing. Protestantism has produced dissension in Church, rebellions and
outbreaks in State, unsoundness in social life, and will never be satisfied short of the
downfall of the Bible! Protestants must admit that the Roman Church has done
more to scatter Christianity and extirpate idolatry than all their sects. From one pulpit
it is said that there is no hell, and from another that there is immediate and unmitigated
damnation. One says that Jesus Christ was only a man; another that you
must be plunged bodily into water to be baptized, and refuses the rites to infants.
Most of them have no prescribed form of worship, no sacred vestments, and their
doctrines are as undefined as their service is informal. The founder of Protestantism,
Martin Luther, was the worst man in Europe. The advent of the Reformation was
the signal for civil war, and from that time to this the world has been in a restless
state, uneasy in regard to Governments, and every day becoming more skeptical. The
ultimate tendency of Protestantism is clearly nothing less than the destruction of all
respect for the Bible, and the disruption of government and society.” Very plain talk
this. The Protestants might easily return the compliment.</p>

 The types of the creation, or the attributes of the Supreme Being, are through the
emanations of Adam Kadmon; these are: “The <i>Crown</i>, <i>Wisdom</i>, <i>Prudence</i>, <i>Magnificence</i>,
<i>Severity</i>, <i>Beauty</i>, <i>Victory</i>, <i>Glory</i>, <i>Foundation</i>, <i>Empire</i>. Wisdom is called
<i>Jeh</i>; Prudence, <i>Jehovah</i>; Severity, <i>Elohim</i>; Magnificence, <i>El</i>; Victory and Glory,
<span class="smcap">Sabaoth</span>; Empire or Dominion, <span class="smcap">Adonai</span>.” Thus when the Nazarenes and other
Gnostics of the more Platonic tendency twitted the Jews as “abortions who worship
their god Iurbo, <i>Adunai</i>,” we need not wonder at the wrath of those who had accepted
the old Mosaic system, but at that of Peter and Jude who claim to be followers
of Jesus and dissent from the views of him who was also a Nazarene.</p>


<p class="footnote"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_386" id="Footnote_386">[386]</a>
 According to the “Kabala,” <i>Empire</i> or <i>Dominion</i> is “the consuming fire, and

 We are fully aware that some Christian kabalists term
En-Soph the “Crown,” identify him with Sephira; call
En-Soph “an emanation from God,” and make the ten
Sephiroth comprise “En-Soph” as a unity. They also very
erroneously reverse the first two emanations of
Sephira—Chochma and Binah. The greatest kabalists have
always held Chochma (Wisdom) as a male and active
intelligence, Jah יה, and placed it under the <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 on
the right side of the triangle, whose apex is the crown,
while Binah (Intelligence) or בינה, is under <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 3 on
the left hand. But the latter, being represented by its
divine name as Jehovah יהוה, very naturally showed
the God of Israel as only a third emanation, as well as
a feminine, passive principle. Hence when the time came
for the Talmudists to transform their multifarious
deities into one living God, they resorted to their
Masoretic points and combined to transform Jehovah into
Adonai, “the Lord.” This, under the persecution of the
Mediæval kabalists by the Church, also forced some of
the former to change their female Sephiroth into male,
and _vice versa_, so as to avoid being accused of
disrespect and blasphemy to Jehovah; whose name,
moreover, by mutual and secret agreement they accepted
as a _substitute_ for Jah, or the mystery name IAO.
Alone the _initiated_ knew of it, but later it gave rise
to a great confusion among the _uninitiated_. It would
be worth while—were it not for lack of space—to quote
a few of the many passages in the oldest Jewish
authorities, such as Rabbi Akiba, and the “Sohar,” which
corroborate our assertion. Chochma-Wisdom is a male
principle everywhere, and Binah-Jehovah, a female
potency. The writings of Irenæus, Theodoret, and
Epiphanius, teeming with accusations against the
Gnostics and “Hæresies,” repeatedly show Simon Magus and
Cerenthus making of Binah the feminine divine Spirit
which inspired Simon. Binah is Sophia, and the Sophia of
the Gnostics is surely not a male potency, but simply
the feminine Wisdom, or Intelligence. (See any ancient
“Arbor Kabbalistica,” or Tree of the Sephiroth.) Eliphas
Levi, in the <span lang="fr">“Rituel de la Haute Magie,”</span>
 <abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
223 and 231, places Chochma as <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 2 and as a male
Sephiroth on the right hand of the Tree. In the “Kabala”
the three male Sephiroth—Chochma, Chesed, Netsah—are
known as the Pillar of Mercy; and the three feminine on
the left, namely, Binah, Geburah, Hod, are named the
Pillar of Judgment; while the four Sephiroth of the
centre—Kether, Tiphereth, Jesod, and Malchuth—are
called the Middle Pillar. And, as Mackenzie, in the
“Royal Masonic Cyclopædia,” shows, “there is an analogy
in these three pillars to the three Pillars of Wisdom,
Strength, and Beauty in a Craft Lodge of Masonry, while
the En-Soph forms the mysterious blazing star, or mystic
light of the East.” (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 407).</p>

 “The Sanscrit <i>s</i>,” says Max Müller, “is represented by the <i>z</i> and <i>h</i>. Thus the
geographical name ‘hapta hendu,’ which occurs in the ‘Avesta,’ becomes intelligible,
if we retranslate the <i>z</i> and <i>h</i> into the Sanscrit <i>s</i>. For ‘Sapta Sindhu,’ or the seven
rivers, is the old Vaidic name for India itself” (“Chips,” <abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 81). The
“Avesta” is the spirit of the “Vedas”—the esoteric meaning made partially known.</p>

 “Although this science is commonly supposed to be peculiar to the Jewish Talmudists,
there is no doubt that they borrowed the idea from a foreign source, and that
from the Chaldeans, the <cite>founders of magic art</cite>,” says King, in the “Gnostics.” The
titles <i>Iao</i> and <i>Abraxas</i>, etc., instead of being recent Gnostic figments, were indeed holy
names, borrowed from the most ancient formulæ of the East. Pliny must allude to
them when he mentions the virtues ascribed by the Magi to amethysts engraved with
the names of the sun and moon, names not expressed in either the Greek or Latin
tongues. In the “<cite>Eternal Sun</cite>,” the “<cite>Abraxas</cite>,” the “<cite>Adonai</cite>,” of these gems, we
recognize the very amulets ridiculed by the philosophic Pliny (“Gnostics,” <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 79, 80);

 Ahriman, the production of Zoroaster, is so called in hatred of the Arias or
Aryas, the Brahmans against whose dominion the Zoroastrians had revolted. Although
an Arya (a noble, a sage) himself, Zoroaster, as in the case of the Devas whom he disgraced
from gods to the position of <em>devils</em>, hesitated not to designate this type of the
spirit of evil under the name of his enemies, the Brahman-Aryas. The whole struggle
of Ahura-mazd and Ahriman is but the allegory of the great religious and political war
between Brahmanism and Zoroastrianism.</p>

the Fathers, held to be divinely inspired, and publicly read in the churches (Irenæus:
“<abbr title="Adversus Hæreses">Adv. Hær.</abbr>,” <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr>, 20). When Tertullian became a Montanist he rejected it, after

 George Smith gives the first verses of the Akkadian
<cite>Genesis</cite> as found in the Cuneiform Texts on the “Lateres
Coctiles.” There, also, we find <i>Anu</i>, the passive deity or
En-Soph, <i>Bel</i>, the Creator, the Spirit of God (Sephira) moving
on the face of the waters, hence water itself, and <i>Hea</i> the
Universal Soul or wisdom of the three combined.</p>

<p class="footnote">The first eight verses read thus:</p>

<p class="footnote">1. When above, were not raised the heavens;</p>

<p class="footnote">2. and below on the earth a plant had not grown up.</p>

<p class="footnote">3. The abyss had not broken its boundaries.</p>

<p class="footnote">4. The chaos (or water) Tiamat (the sea) was the producing mother of
the whole of them. (This is the Cosmical Aditi and Sephira.)</p>

<p class="footnote">5. Those waters at the beginning were ordained but</p>

<p class="footnote">6. a tree had not grown, a flower had not unfolded.</p>

<p class="footnote">7. When the gods had not sprung up, any one of them;</p>

 Thus is it that we find in all the philosophical

upon the Mercy Seat; and we find even
Jesus made to say, in an old text, “My <em>Mother</em>,
the Holy Ghost, took me.”</p>

 Eve is the trinity of nature, and Adam the unity of
spirit; the former the created material principle, the
latter the ideal organ of the creative principle, or, in
other words, this androgyne is both the principle and
the Logos, for א is the male, and ב the female; and, as
Levi expresses it, this first letter of the holy
language, Aleph, represents a man pointing with one hand
toward the sky, and with the other toward the ground. It
is the macrocosm and the microcosm at the same time, and
explains the double triangle of the Masons and the
five-pointed star. While the male is active the female
principle is passive, for it is <span class="allsmcap">SPIRIT</span> and <span class="allsmcap">MATTER</span>, the
latter word meaning _mother_ in nearly every language.
The columns of Solomon’s temple, Jachin and Boaz, are
the emblems of the androgyne; they are also respectively
male and female, white and black, square and round; the
male a unity, the female a binary. In the later
kabalistic treatises, the active principle is pictured
by the sword זכר, the passive by the sheath נקבה. See

 The vertical line being the male principle, and
the horizontal the female, out of the union of the
two at the intersection point is formed the <span class="allsmcap">CROSS</span>;
the oldest symbol in the Egyptian history of gods.
It is the key of Heaven in the rosy fingers of Neith,
the celestial virgin, who opens the gate at dawn for
the exit of her first-begotten, the radiant sun. It is
the Stauros of the Gnostics, and the philosophical
cross of the high-grade Masons. We find this symbol
ornamenting the <i>tee</i> of the umbrella-shaped oldest
pagodas in Thibet, China, and India, as we find it in
the hand of Isis, in the shape of the “handled cross.”
In one of the Chaitya caves, at Ajunta, it surmounts
the three umbrellas in stone, and forms the centre
of the vault.</p>

 A Hanoverian scientist has recently published a work entitled <cite lang="de">Ueber die Auflösung
der Arten dinck Natürliche Jucht Wahl</cite>, in which he shows, with great ingenuity, that
Darwin was wholly mistaken in tracing man back to the ape. On the contrary, he
maintains that it is the ape which has evolved from man. That, in the beginning, mankind
were, morally and physically, the types and prototypes of our present race and of
human dignity, by their beauty of form, regularity of feature, cranial development,
nobility of sentiments, heroic impulses, and grandeur of ideal conceptions. This is a
purely Brahmanic, Buddhistic, and kabalistic philosophy. His book is copiously illustrated
with diagrams, tables, etc. He says that the gradual debasement and degradation
of man, morally and physically, can be readily traced throughout the ethnological
transformations down to our times. And, as one portion has already degenerated into
apes, so the civilized man of the present day will at last, under the action of the inevitable
law of necessity, be also succeeded by like descendants. If we may judge of the
future by the actual present, it certainly does seem possible that so unspiritual and
materialistic a body as our physical scientists should end as <i>simia</i> rather than as seraphs.</p>

 Not only did the Buddhist missionaries make their way to the Mesopotamian
Valley, but they even went so far west as Ireland. The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Dr. Lundy, in his work on
“Monumental Christianity,” referring to an Irish Round Tower, observes: “Henry
O’Brien explains this Round Tower Crucifixion as that of Buddha; the animals as the
elephant and the bull, sacred to Buddha, and into which his soul entered after death;
the two figures standing beside the cross as Buddha’s virgin mother, and Kama his
favorite disciple. The whole picture bears a close likeness to the Crucifixion, in the
cemetery of Pope Julius, except the animals, which are conclusive proof that it cannot
be Christian. It came ultimately from the far East to Ireland, with the Phœnician
colonists, who erected the Round Towers as symbols of the life-giving and preserving
power of man and nature, and how that universal life is produced through suffering and
death.”</p>

<p class="footnote">When a Protestant clergyman is thus forced to confess the pre-Christian existence
of the crucifix in Ireland, its Buddhistic character, and the penetration of the missionaries
of that faith even to that then remote portion of the earth, we need not wonder that
in the minds of the Nazarean contemporaries of Jesus and their descendants, he should
not have been associated with that universally known emblem in the character of a
Redeemer.</p>

<p class="footnote">In noticing this admission of Dr. Lundy, Mr. Charles Sotheran remarked, in a
lecture before the American Philological Society, that both legends and archæological
remains unite in proving beyond question “that Ireland, like every other nation, once
listened to the propagandists of Siddhârtha-Buddha.”</p>

 We hold to the idea—which becomes self-evident when the Zoroastrian imbroglio
is considered—that there were, even in the days of Darius, two distinct sacerdotal castes
of Magi: the initiated and those who were allowed to officiate in the popular rites
only. We see the same in the Eleusinian Mysteries. Belonging to every temple there
were attached the “hierophants” of the <em>inner</em> sanctuary, and the secular clergy who
were not even instructed in the Mysteries. It is against the absurdities and superstitions
of the latter that Darius revolted, and “crushed them,” for the inscription of his tomb
shows that he was a “hierophant” and a Magian himself. It is also but the exoteric
rites of this class of Magi which descended to posterity, for the great secresy in which
were preserved the “Mysteries” of the true Chaldean Magi was never violated, however
much guess-work may have been expended on them.</p>

 These are truths which cannot fail to impress themselves upon the minds of earnest
thinkers. While the Ebionites, Nazarites, Hemerobaptists, Lampseans, Sabians, and
the many other earliest sects which wavered later between the varying dogmatisms suggested
to them by the <em>esoteric</em> and misunderstood parables of the Nazarene teacher,
whom they justly regarded as a prophet, there were men, for whose names we would
vainly search history, who preserved the secret doctrines of Jesus as pure and unadulterated
as they had been received. And still, even all these above-mentioned and conflicting
sects were far more orthodox in their Christianity, or rather Christism, than the Churches
of Constantine and Rome. “It was a strange fate that befell these unfortunate people”
(the Ebionites), says Lord Amberley, “when, overwhelmed by the flood of heathenism
that had swept into the Church, they were condemned as heretics. Yet, there is no
evidence that they had ever swerved from the doctrines of Jesus, or of the disciples who
knew him in his lifetime.... Jesus himself was circumcised ... reverenced the temple
at Jerusalem as ‘a house of prayer for all nations.’... But the torrent of progress
swept past the Ebionites, and left them stranded on the shore” (“An Analysis of Religious
Beliefs,” by Viscount Amberley, <abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 446).</p>

 What will, perhaps, still more astonish American readers, is the fact that, in the
United States, a mystical fraternity now exists, which claims an intimate relationship
with one of the oldest and most powerful of Eastern Brotherhoods. It is known as
the Brotherhood of Luxor, and its faithful members have the custody of very important
secrets of science. Its ramifications extend widely throughout the great Republic of
the West. Though this brotherhood has been long and hard at work, the secret of its
existence has been jealously guarded. Mackenzie describes it as having “a Rosicrucian
basis, and numbering many members” (“Royal Masonic Cyclopædia,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 461). But, in
this, the author is mistaken; it has no Rosicrucian basis. The name Luxor is primarily
derived from the ancient Beloochistan city of Looksur, which lies between Bela and
Kedgee, and also gave its name to the Egyptian city.</p>

 These people do not accept the name of Druzes, but regard the appellation as an
insult. They call themselves the “disciples of Hamsa,” their Messiah, who came to
them, in the tenth century, from the “Land of the Word of God,” and, together with
his disciple, Mochtana Boha-eddin, committed this <em>Word</em> to writing, and entrusted it
to the care of a few initiates, with the injunction of the greatest secresy. They are
usually called Unitarians.</p>

 This pernicious doctrine belongs to the old policy of the Catholic Church, but is
certainly false as regards the Druzes. They maintain that it is right and lawful to
<em>withhold the truth</em> about their own tenets, no one outside their own sect having a right
to pry into their religion. The <em>okhals</em> never countenance deliberate falsehood in any
form, although the laymen have many a time got rid of the spies sent by the Christians
to discover their secrets, by deceiving them with sham initiations. (See the letter

 This “Self,” which the Greek philosophers called <i>Augœides</i>, the “Shining One,”
is impressively and beautifully described in Max Müller’s “Veda.” Showing the
“Veda” to be the first book of the Aryan nations, the professor adds that “we have
in it a period of the intellectual life of man to which there is no parallel in any other
part of the world. In the hymns of the “Veda” we see man left to himself to solve the
riddle of this world.... He invokes the gods around him, he praises, he worships
them. But still with all these gods ... beneath him, and above him, the early poet
seems ill at rest within himself. There, too, in his own breast, he has discovered a
power that is never mute when he prays, never absent when he fears and trembles.
It seems to inspire his prayers, and yet to listen to them; it seems to live in him, and
yet to support him and all around him. The only name he can find for this mysterious
power is ‘Brahman;’ for <i>brahman</i> meant originally force, will, wish, and the
propulsive power of creation. But this impersonal brahman, too, as soon as it is
named, grows into something strange and divine. It ends by being one of many gods,
one of the great triad, worshipped to the present day. And still the thought within him
has no real name; that power which is nothing but itself, which supports the gods, the
heavens, and every living being, floats before his mind, conceived but not expressed.
At last he calls it ‘Âtman,’ for Âtman, originally breath or spirit, comes to mean Self,
and Self alone; <em>Self</em>, whether Divine or human; Self, whether creating or suffering;
Self, whether one or all; but always Self, independent and free. ‘Who has seen the
first-born,’ says the poet, when he who had no bones (<i>i.e.</i>, form) bore him that had
bones? Where was the life, the blood, the Self of the world? Who went to ask this
from any one who knew it?” (“Rig-Veda,” <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, 164, 4). This idea of a divine Self,
once expressed, everything else must acknowledge its supremacy; “<em>Self</em> is the Lord of
all things, Self is the King of all things. As all the spokes of a wheel are contained
in the nave and the circumference, all things are contained in this Self; all Selves are
contained in this Self. Brahman itself is but Self” (Ibid., <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 478; “Khândogya-upanishad,”

 In Payne Knight’s “Ancient Art and Mythology,” Serapis is represented as wearing
his hair long, “formally turned back and disposed in ringlets falling down upon his
breast and shoulders like that of women. His whole person, too, is always enveloped
in drapery reaching to his feet.” (<abbr title="Section 145">§ cxlv.</abbr>). This is the conventional picture of Christ.</p>

 The “Life of Jesus” by Strauss, which Renan calls “<i lang="fr">un livre, commode, exact,
spirituel et consciencieux</i>” (a handy, exact, witty, and conscientious book), rude and
iconoclastic as it is, is nevertheless in many ways preferable to the “Vie de Jesus,” of
the French author. Laying aside the intrinsic and historical value of the two works—with
which we have nothing to do, we now simply point to Renan’s distorted outline-sketch
of Jesus. We cannot think what led Renan into such an erroneous delineation
of character. Few of those who, while rejecting the divinity of the Nazarene prophet,
still believe that he is no myth, can read the work without experiencing an uneasy, and
even angry feeling at such a psychological mutilation. He makes of Jesus a sort of
sentimental ninny, a theatrical simpleton, enamored of his own poetical divagations
and speeches, wanting every one to adore him, and finally caught in the snares of his
enemies. Such was not Jesus, the Jewish philanthropist, the adept and mystic of a
school now forgotten by the Christians and the Church—if it ever was known to her;
the hero, who preferred even to risk death, rather than withhold some truths which he
believed would benefit humanity. We prefer Strauss who openly names him an impostor
and a pretender, occasionally calling in doubt his very existence; but who at least
spares him that ridiculous color of sentimentalism in which Renan paints him.</p>

 In a recent work, called the “World’s Sixteen Crucified Saviors” (by Mr. Kersey
Graves) which attracted our notice by its title, we were indeed startled as we were
forewarned on the title-page we should be by <em>historical</em> evidences to be found neither in
history nor tradition. Apollonius, who is represented in it as one of these sixteen
“saviours,” is shown by the author as finally “<em>crucified</em> ... having risen from the
dead ... appearing to his disciples after his resurrection, and”—like Christ again—“convincing
a <em>Tommy</em>(?) Didymus” by getting him to feel the print of the nails on his
hands and feet (see note, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 268). To begin with, neither Philostratus, the biographer
of Apollonius, nor history says any such thing. Though the precise time of his death is
unknown, no disciple of Apollonius ever said that he was either crucified, or appeared
to them. So much for one “Saviour.” After that we are told that Gautama-Buddha,
whose life and death have been so minutely described by several authorities, Barthelemy
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilaire included—was also “<em>crucified</em> by his enemies near the foot of the Nepäl
mountains” (see <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107); while the Buddhist books, history, and scientific research tell
us, through the lips of Max Müller and a host of Orientalists, that “Gautama-Buddha
(Sâkya-muni) died near the Ganges.... He had nearly reached the city of Kusinâgara,
when his vital strength began to fail. He halted in a forest, and while sitting
under a sâl tree he gave up the ghost” (Max Müller: “Chips from a German Workshop,”
<abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 213). The references of Mr. Graves to Higgins and Sir W. Jones,
in some of his hazardous speculations, prove nothing. Max Müller shows some
antiquated authorities writing elaborate books “... in order to prove that Buddha
had been in reality the Thoth of the Egyptians; that he was Mercury, or Wodan, or
Zoroaster, or Pythagoras.... Even Sir W. Jones ... identified Buddha first
with Odin and afterwards with Shishak.” We are in the nineteenth century, not in
the eighteenth; and though to write books on the authority of the earliest Orientalists
may in one sense be viewed as a mark of respect for old age, it is not always safe to
try the experiment in our times. Hence this highly instructive volume lacks one important
feature which would have made it still more interesting. The author should
have added after Prometheus the “Roman,” and Alcides the <em>Egyptian god</em> (<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 266) a
seventeenth “crucified Saviour” to the list, “Venus, god of the war,” introduced to
an admiring world by Mr. Artemus Ward the “showman!”</p>

 Of the Abbé Huc, Max Müller thus wrote in his “Chips from a German Workshop,”
<abbr title="volume one">vol. i.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 187: “The late Abbé Huc pointed out the similarities between the
Buddhist and Roman Catholic ceremonials with such a <i lang="fr">naïveté</i>, that, to his surprise, he
found his delightful ‘Travels in Thibet’ placed on the ‘Index.’ ‘One cannot fail
being struck,’ he writes, ‘with their great resemblance with the Catholicism. The
bishop’s crosier, the mitre, the dalmatic, the round hat that the great lamas wear in
travel ... the mass, the double choir, the psalmody, the exorcisms, the censer with five
chains to it, opening and shutting at will, the blessings of the lamas, who extend their
right hands over the head of the faithful ones, the rosary, the celibacy of the clergy,
the penances and retreats, the cultus of the Saints, the fasting, the processions, the
litanies, the holy water; such are the similarities of the Buddhists with ourselves.
He might have added tonsure, relics, and the confessional.”</p>

 Many are the marvels recorded as having taken place at his death, or we should
rather say his translation; for he did not die as others do, but having suddenly disappeared,
while a dazzling light filled the cavern with glory, his body was again seen upon
its subsidence. When this heavenly light gave place to the habitual semi-darkness of
the gloomy cave—then only, says Ginsburg, “the disciples of Israel perceived that
the lamp of Israel was extinguished.” His biographers tell us that there were voices
heard from Heaven during the preparation for his funeral and at his interment. When
the coffin was lowered down into the deep cave excavated for it, a flame broke out from
it, and a voice mighty and majestic pronounced these words in the air: “This is he
who caused the earth to quake, and the kingdoms to shake!”</p>

 by the Jesuits
to throw discredit upon the facts collected by the Commissioners of the French Parliament
in 1762, as for the most part malicious fabrications. “To ascertain the validity
of this impeachment,” says the author of “The Principles of the Jesuits,” “the libraries
of the two universities of the British Museum and of Sion College have been searched
for the authors cited; and in every instance where the volume was found, the correctness
of the citation established.”</p>

(<abbr title="Leviticus twenty-four">Levit. xxiv.</abbr> 17); and from verse 18 and following it reads: “And he that killeth a

of life.” And King James’s translators have made such a jumble of it that <em>no one but
a kabalist can restore the Bible to its original form</em>.</p>

 In “Egypt’s Place in Universal History,” Bunsen gives the cycle of 21,000 years,
which he adopts to facilitate the chronological calculations for the reconstruction of
the universal history of mankind. He shows that this cycle “for the nutation of the
ecliptic,” arrived at its apex in the year 1240 of our era. He says:</p>

<p class="footnote">“The cycle divides itself into two halves of 10,500 (or twice 5,250) years each.</p>

<p class="footnote">The Baron explains that “in round numbers, the most favorable epochs for our
hemisphere since the great catastrophe in Middle Asia (Deluge 10,000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) are:
the 4,000 years before, and the 4,000 years after Christ; and the beginning of the
first epoch, <em>of which alone we can judge</em>, as it alone is complete before us, coincides
exactly with the beginnings of national history, or (what is identical) with the beginning
of <em>our consciousness</em> of continuous existence” (“Egypt’s Place in Universal History,”
Key, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 102).</p>

<p class="footnote">“Our consciousness” must mean, we suppose, the consciousness <em>of scientists</em>, who
accept nothing <em>on faith</em>, but much on unverified hypotheses. We do not say this with
reference to the above-quoted author, earnest scholar and noble champion that he is,
of freedom in the Christian Church, but generally. Baron Bunsen has well found for
himself that a man cannot remain an honest scientist and please the clerical party.
Even the little concessions he made in favor of the antiquity of mankind, brought on
him, in 1859, the most insolent denunciations, such as “We lose all faith in the author’s
judgment ... he has yet to learn the very first principles of historical criticisms
... extravagant and <em>unscientific</em> exaggeration,” and so on—the pious vituperator
closing his learned denunciations by assuring the public that Baron Bunsen “<cite>cannot
even construct a Greek sentence</cite>” (“Quarterly Review,” 1859; see also “Egypt’s Place
in Universal History,” <abbr title="chapter">chap.</abbr> on Egyptological Works and English Reviews). But we
do regret that Baron Bunsen had no better opportunity to examine the “Kabala” and

 We cannot help quoting a remark by Baron Bunsen in relation to the “Word”
being identical with the “Ineffable Name” of the Masons and the kabalists. While explaining
the “Ritual,” some of the details of which “resemble rather the <em>enchantments
of a magician than solemn rites</em>, although a hidden and mystical meaning must have
been attached to them” (the honest admission of this much, at least, is worth something),
the author observes: “The mystery of names, the knowledge of which was a
sovereign virtue, and which, at a later period, degenerated into the <em>rank heresy</em> (?) of
the Gnostics and the magic of enchanters, appears to have <em>existed not only in Egypt
but elsewhere</em>. Traces of it are found in the ‘Cabala’ ... it prevailed in the Greek
and Asiatic mythology” (“Egypt’s Place, etc.,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 147).</p>

<p class="footnote">We then see the representatives of Science agreeing upon this one point, at least.
The initiates of all countries had the same “mystery name.” And now it remains with
the scholars to prove that every adept, hierophant, magician, or enchanter (Moses and
Aaron included) as well as every kabalist, from the institution of the Mysteries down
to the present age, has been either a knave or a fool, for believing in the efficacy of
this name.</p>

crime of high treason, because he is not subject to the king</em>” (“Confessarium Aphorismi
Verbo Clericus,” Ed. Coloniæ, 1615, Ed. Coll. Sion). “<cite>The people</cite>,” says
John Bridgewater, “<cite>are not only permitted, but they are required and their duty
demands</cite>, that at the mandate of the Vicar of Christ, <cite>who is the sovereign pastor over
all nations of the earth</cite>, the faith which they had previously made with such princes
should not be kept” (“Concertatio Ecclesiæ Catholicæ in Angliâ adversus Calvino
Papistas,” Resp. <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 348).</p>

<p class="footnote">In “De Rege et Regis Institutione, Libri Tres,” 1640 (Edit. Mus. Brit.), John
Mariana goes even farther: “If the circumstances will permit,” he says, “it will be
lawful to destroy with the sword the prince who is declared a public enemy.... <cite>I
shall never consider that man to have done wrong, who, favouring the public wishes,
should attempt to kill him</cite>,” and “<cite>to put them to death is not only lawful, but a laudble
and glorious action</cite>.” <span lang="la">Est tamen salutaris cogitatio, ut sit principibus persuasum
si rempublicam oppresserint, si vitiis et fæditate intolerandi erunt, <em>eâ conditione vivere,

<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 6, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 61).</p>

<p class="footnote">But the most delicate piece of Christian teaching is found in the precept of this
Jesuit when he argues upon the best and surest way of killing kings and statesmen.
“In my own opinion,” he says, “deleterious drugs should not be given to an enemy,
neither should a deadly poison be mixed with his food or in his cup.... Yet <em>it will
indeed be lawful to use this method</em> in the case in question (that <em>he who should kill the
tyrant would be highly esteemed, both in favor and in praise</em>,” for “<em>it is a glorious
thing to exterminate this pestilent and mischievous race from the community of men</em>),
not to constrain the person who is to be killed to take of himself the poison which,
inwardly received, would deprive him of life, <em>but to cause it to be outwardly applied by
another</em> without his intervention; as, when there is so much strength in the poison,
that if spread upon a seat or on the clothes it would be sufficiently powerful to cause
death” (Ibid., <abbr title="liber">lib.</abbr> <abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, c. f.,

 See Gaffarel’s version; Eliphas Levi’s <span lang="fr">“La Science des Esprits;”</span> Mackenzie’s
“Royal Masonic Cyclopædia;” “Sepher Toldos Jeshu;” and other kabalistical and
Rabbinical works. The story given is this. A virgin named Mariam, betrothed to a
young man of the name of Iohanan, was outraged by another man named Ben Panther
or Joseph Panther, says “Sepher Toldos Jeshu.” “Her betrothed, learning of her
misfortune, left her, at the same time forgiving her. The child born was Jesus, named
Joshua. Adopted by his uncle Rabbi Jehosuah, he was initiated into the secret doctrine
by Rabbi Elhanan, a kabalist, and then by the Egyptian priests, who consecrated him
High Pontiff of the Universal Secret Doctrine, on account of his great mystic qualities.
Upon his return into Judea his learning and powers excited the jealousy of the Rabbis,
and they publicly reproached him with his origin and insulted his mother. Hence the
words attributed to Jesus at Cana: ‘Woman, what have I to do with thee?’ (See
John <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr> 4.) His disciples having rebuked him with his unkindness to his mother,
Jesus repented, and having learned from them the particulars of the sad story, he declared
that “My mother has not sinned, she has not lost her innocence; she is immaculate
and yet she is a mother.... As for myself I have no father, in this world, I am
the Son of God and of humanity!” Sublime words of confidence and trust in the unseen
Power, but how fatal to the millions upon millions of men murdered because of
these very words being so thoroughly misunderstood!</p>

 The Greek monks have this “miracle” performed for the “faithful” every year

 The <i>Rishi</i> are identical with <cite>Manu</cite>. The ten Pragâpati, sons of Viradj, called
Maritchi, Atri, Angira, Pôlastya, Poulaha, Kratu, Pratcheta, Vasishta, Brighu, and
Narada, are euhemerized <i>Powers</i>, the Hindu Sephiroth. These emanate the seven
Rishi, or Manus, the chief of whom issued himself from the “uncreated.” He is the
Adam of earth, and signifies man. His “sons,” the following six Manus, represent
each a new race of men, and in the total they are <em>humanity</em> passing gradually through
the primitive seven stages of evolution.</p>


<p class="footnote"><a class="label pginternal" href="#FNanchor_811" id="Footnote_811">[811]</a>
 In days of old, when the Brahmans studied more than they do now the hidden
sense of their philosophy, they explained that each of these six distinct races which preceded
ours had disappeared. But now they pretend that a specimen was preserved
which was not destroyed with the rest, but reached the present <em>seventh</em> stage. Thus
they, the Brahmans are the specimens of the heavenly Manu, and issued from the mouth
of Brahma; while the Sudra was created from his foot.</p>

 Without the esoteric explanation, the “Old Testament” becomes an absurd
jumble of meaningless tales—nay, worse than that, it must rank high with <em>immoral</em>
books. It is curious that Professor Max Müller, such a profound scholar in Comparative
Mythology, should be found saying of the pragâpatis and Hindu gods that they are

 This assimilation of the deluge to an earthquake on the Assyrian tablets would go

 George Smith notes in the tablets, first the creation of the moon, and then of the
sun: “Its beauty and perfection are extolled, and the regularity of its orbit, which led
to its being considered the type of a judge and the regulator of the world.” Did this
story of the deluge relate simply to a cosmogonical cataclysm—even were it universal—why
should the goddess Ishtara or Astoreth (the moon) speak of the <em>creation of the sun</em>
after the deluge? The waters might have reached as high as the mountain of <i>Nizir</i>
(Chaldean version), or Jebel-Djudi (the deluge-mountains of the Arabian legends), or
yet Ararat (of the biblical narrative), and even Himalaya of the Hindu tradition, and
yet not reach the sun—even the Bible itself stopped short of such a miracle. It is evident
that the deluge of the people who first recorded it had another meaning, less
problematical and far more philosophical than that of a <em>universal</em> deluge, of which there
are no geological traces whatever.</p>

 The Asiatic origin of the first dwellers in the Nilotic Valley is clearly demonstrated

 There are some Orientalists who believe that this custom was introduced only
after the early Christian settlements in Æthiopia; but as under the Romans the population
of this country was nearly all changed, the element becoming wholly Arabic, we
may, without doubting the statement, believe that it was the predominating Arab influence
which had altered the earliest mode of writing. Their present method is even
more analogous to the Devanāgarï, and other more ancient Indian Alphabets, which
read from left to right; and their letters show no resemblance to the Phœnician
characters. Moreover, all the ancient authorities corroborate our assertion still more.
Philostratus makes the Brahmin Iarchus say (V. A., <abbr title="three">iii.</abbr>, 6) that the Æthiopians were
originally <em>an Indian race</em>, compelled to emigrate from the mother-land for sacrilege
and regicide (see Pococke’s “India,” etc., <abbr title="two">ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 206). An Egyptian is made to remark,
that he had heard from his father, that the Indians were the wisest of men, and that the
Æthiopians, a colony of the Indians, preserved the wisdom and usages of their fathers,
and acknowledged their ancient origin. Julius Africanus (in Eusebius and Syncellus),
makes the same statement. And Eusebius writes: “The Æthiopians, emigrating from
the river Indus, settled in the vicinity of Egypt” (Lemp., Barker’s edition, “Meroë”).</p>

 They might have been also, as Pococke thinks, simply the tribes of the “Oxus,”
a name derived from the “Ookshas,” those people whose wealth lay in the “Ox,” for
he shows <i>Ookshan</i> to be a crude form of <i>Ooksha</i>, an ox (in Sanscrit <i>ox</i> is as in English).
He believes that it was they, “the lords of the Oxus,” who gave their name to the sea
around which they ruled in many a country, the <i>Euxine</i> or Ooksh-ine. <i>Pali</i> means a
shepherd, and <i>s’than</i> is a land. “The warlike tribes of the Oxus penetrated into
Egypt, then swept onward to Palestine (<span class="smcap">Pali-stan</span>), the land of the Palis or shepherds,
and there effected more permanent settlements” (“India in Greece”). Yet, if even
so, it would only the more confirm our opinion that the Jews are a hybrid race, for the
“Bible” shows them freely intermarrying, not alone with the Canaanites, but with
every other nation or race they come in contact with.</p>

 About 1040, the Jewish doctors removed their schools from Babylonia to Spain,
and of the four great rabbis that flourished during the next four centuries, their works all
show different readings, and abound with mistakes in the manuscripts. The “Masorah”

 No chronology was accepted by the rabbis as authoritative till the twelfth century.
The 40 and 1,000 are not exact numbers, but have been crammed in to answer
monotheism and the exigencies of a religion calculated to appear different from that
of the Pagans. (“Chron. Orth.,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 238). One finds in the “Pentateuch” only
events occurring about two years before the fabled “Exodus” and the last year. The

 The Gnostics, called Collyridians, had transferred from Astoreth their worship to
Mary, also Queen of Heaven. They were persecuted and put to death by the orthodox
Christians as heretics. But if these Gnostics had established her worship by offering
her sacrifices of cakes, cracknels, or fine wafers, it was because they imagined her to
have been born of an immaculate virgin, as Christ is alleged to have been born of
his mother. And now, the Pope’s <em>infallibility</em> having been recognized and accepted,
its first practical manifestation is the revival of the Collyridian belief as an article of
faith (See “Apocryphal New Testament;” Hone: “The Gospel of Mary attributed
to Matthew”).</p>

 We do not see why the clergy—especially the Catholic—should object to our statement
that the patriarchs are all signs of the zodiac, and the old gods of the “heathen” as
well. There was a time, and that less than two centuries ago, when they themselves
exhibited the most fervent desire to relapse into sun and star worship. This pious and
curious attempt was denounced but a few months since by Camille Flammarion, the
French astronomer. He shows two Augsburgian Jesuits, Schiller and Bayer, who felt
quite anxious to change the names of the whole Sabean host of the starry heaven, and
worship them again under Christian names! Having anathematized the idolatrous sun-worshippers
for over fifteen centuries, the Church now seriously proposed to continue
heliolatry—<em>to the letter</em> this time—as their idea was to substitute for Pagan myths biblical
and (in their ideas) real personages. They would have called the sun, Christ; the moon,
Virgin Mary; Saturn, Adam; Jupiter, Moses (!); Mars, Joshua; Venus, John the
Baptist; and Mercury, Elias. And very proper substitutes too, showing the great
familiarity of the Catholic Church with ancient Pagan and kabalistic learning, and its
readiness, perhaps, to at last confess the source whence came their own myths. For is
not king Messiah the sun, the Demiurge of the heliolaters, under various names? Is he
not the Egyptian Osiris and the Grecian Apollo? And what more appropriate name
than Virgin Mary for the Pagan Diana-Astarté, “the Queen of Heaven,” against
which Jeremiah exhausted a whole vocabulary of imprecations? Such an adoption
would have been historically as well as religiously correct. Two large plates were
prepared, says Flammarion, in a recent number of “La Nature,” and represented the
heavens with Christian constellations instead of Pagan. Apostles, popes, saints, martyrs,
and personages of the Old and New Testament completed this Christian Sabeanism.
“The disciples of Loyola used every exertion to make this plan succeed.” It is curious
to find in India among the Mussulmans the name of Terah, Abraham’s father, Azar
or Azarh, and Azur, which also means fire, and is, at the same time, the name of the
Hindu third solar month (from June to July), during which the sun is in <i>Gemini</i>, and
the full moon near <i>Sagittarius</i>.</p>

 See <abbr title="volume One">vol. I.</abbr> of the present work, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32. Alone, the Hindu calculation by the
Zodiac, can give a key to the Hebrew chronologies and the ages of the patriarchs.
If we bear in mind that, according to the former astronomical and chronological calculations,
out of the fourteen manwantara (or divine ages), each of which composed of
<em>twelve</em> thousand years of the devas, multiplied by seventy-one, forms <em>one period</em> of
creation—not quite <em>seven</em> are yet passed, the Hebrew calculation will become more clear.
To help, as much as possible, those who will be sure to get a good deal bewildered in this
calculation, we will remind the reader that the Zodiac is divided into 360 degrees,
and every sign into thirty degrees; that in the Samaritan <em>Bible the age of Enoch is
fixed at 360 years</em>; that in “Manu,” the divisions of time are given thus: “The day
and the night are composed of thirty <i>Mouhourta</i>. A mouhourta contains thirty <i>kalâs</i>.
A month of the mortals is of thirty days, but it is but <em>one</em> day of the pitris.... A
year of the mortals is one day of the Devas.”</p>

of the twelve great gods. So, 1. Mecha (Aries) is dedicated to Varuna; 2. Vricha
(Taurus), to Yama; 3. Mithuna (Gemini), to Pavana; 4. Karcataca (Cancer), to
Sûrya; 5. Sinha (Leo), to Soma; 6. Kanya (Virgo), to Kartikeia; 7. Toulha (Libra),
to Kouvera; 8. Vristchica (Scorpio), to Kama; 9. Dhanous (Sagittarius), to Ganesa;

 How servile was this Chaldean <em>copy</em> may be seen in comparing the Hindu chronology
with that of the Babylonians. According to Manu, the antediluvian dynasties
of the Pradjâpatis reigned 4,320,000 human years, a whole divine age of the devas in
short, or that length of time which invariably occurs between life on earth and the dissolution
of that life, or pralaya. The Chaldeans, in their turn, give precisely the same
figures, minus <em>one</em> cipher, to wit: they make their 120 saros yield a total of 432,000
years.</p>

 So firmly established seems to have been the reputation of the Brahmans and
Buddhists for the highest morality, and that since time immemorial, that we find Colonel
Henry Yule, in his admirable edition of “Marco Polo,” giving the following testimony:
“The high virtues ascribed to the Brahman and Indian merchants were, perhaps, in
part, matter of tradition ... but the eulogy is so constant among mediæval travellers
<em>that it must have had a solid foundation</em>. In fact, it would not be difficult to trace
a chain of similar testimony from ancient times down to our own. Arrian says no
Indian was ever accused of falsehood. Hwen T’sang ascribes to the people of India
eminent uprightness, honesty, and disinterestedness. Friar Jordanus (<i>circa</i> 1330) says
the people of Lesser India (Sindh and Western India) were true in speech and eminent
in justice; and we may also refer to the high character given to the Hindus by Abul
Fazl. But <em>after 150 years of European trade, indeed, we find a sad deterioration</em>....
Yet Pallas, in the last century, noticing the Bamyan colony at Astrakhan, says its members
were notable for an upright dealing that made them greatly preferable to Armenians.
And that wise and admirable public servant, the late Sir William Sleeman, in
our own time, has said that he knew no class of men in the world more strictly honorable
than the mercantile classes of
 <span class="lock">India.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_900" id="FNanchor_900">[900]</a></span></p>

Siva, at the time the “Vedas” were completed, was an aboriginal or Æthiopian God,

 The “Avesta” describes the serpent Dahaka, as of the region of Bauri or Babylonia.
In the Median history are two kings of the name Deiokes or Dahaka, and
Astyages or Az-dahaka. There were children of Zohak seated on various Eastern
thrones, after Feridun. It is apparent, therefore, that by Zohak is meant the Assyrian
dynasty, whose symbol was the <i lang="la">purpureum signum draconis</i>—the purple sign of the
Dragon. From a very remote antiquity (Genesis <abbr title="fourteen">xiv.</abbr>) this dynasty ruled Asia, Armenia,
Syria, Arabia, Babylonia, Media, Persia, Bactria, and Afghanistan. It was
finally overthrown by Cyrus and Darius Hystaspes, after “1,000 years’” rule. Yima
and Thrætaona, or Jemshid and Feridun, are doubtless personifications. Zohak probably
imposed the Assyrian or Magian worship of fire upon the Persians. Darius was
the vicegerent of Ahura-Mazda.</p>

 The name in the Gospels is βεελζεβουλ, or Baal of the Dwelling. It is pretty
certain that Apollo, the Delphian God, was not Hellenian originally, but Phœnician.
He was the Paian or physician, as well as the god of oracles. It is no great stretch of
imagination to identify him with Baal-<i>Zebul</i>, the god of Ekron, or Acheron, doubtless
changed to <i>Zebub</i>, or flies, by the Jews in derision.</p>

 We doubt the propriety of rendering κορη, virgin. Demeter and Persephoneia
were substantially the same divinity, as were Apollo and Esculapius. The scene of this
adventure is laid in <i>Krete</i> or <i>Koureteia</i>, where Zeus was chief god. It was, doubtless,
<i>Keres</i> or Demeter that is intended. She was also named κουρα, which is the same as
κωρη. As she was the goddess of the Mysteries, she was fittest for the place as consort
of the Serpent-God and mother of Zagreus.</p>

 See des Mousseaux; see various other Demonographers; the different “Trials
of Witches,” the depositions of the latter exacted by torture, etc. In our humble
opinion, the Devil must have contracted this disagreeable smell and his habits of
uncleanliness in company with mediæval monks. Many of these saints boasted of
having never washed themselves! “To strip one’s self for the sake of <em>vain</em> cleanliness,
is to sin in the eyes of God,” says Sprenger, in the “Witches’ Hammer.” Hermits
and monks “dreaded all cleansing as so much defilement. There was no bathing for a
thousand years!” exclaims Michelet in his <span lang="fr">“Sorcière.”</span> Why such an outcry against
Hindu fakirs in such a case? These, if they keep dirty, besmear themselves only
after washing, for their religion commands them to wash every morning, and sometimes
several times a day.</p>

 Wine was first made <em>sacred</em> in the mysteries of Bacchus. Payne Knight believes—erroneously
we think—that wine was taken with the view to produce a false
ecstasy through intoxication. It was held <em>sacred</em>, however, and the Christian Eucharist
is certainly an imitation of the Pagan rite. Whether Mr. Knight was right or wrong,
we regret to say that a Protestant clergyman, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Joseph Blanchard, of New
York, was found drunk in one of the public squares on the night of Sunday, August 5,
1877, and lodged in prison. The published report says: “The prisoner said that he
had been to church and taken a little too much of the communion wine!”</p>

 In the “Life of Buddha,” of Bkah Hgyur (Thibetan text), we find the original of
the episode given in the Gospel according to Luke. An old and holy ascetic, Rishi Asita,
comes from afar to see the infant Buddha, instructed as he is of his birth and mission by
supernatural visions. Having worshipped the little Gautama, the old saint bursts into
tears, and upon being questioned upon the cause of his grief, answers: “After becoming
Buddha, he will help hundreds of thousands of millions of creatures to pass to the other
shore of the ocean of life, and will lead them on forever to immortality. And I—I shall
not behold this pearl of Buddhas! Cured of my illness, I shall not be freed by him
from human passion! Great King! I am too old—that is why I weep, and why, in
my sadness, I heave long sighs!”</p>

<p class="footnote">It does not prevent the holy man, however, from delivering prophecies about the young
Buddha, which, with a very slight difference, are of the same substance as those of Simeon
about Jesus. While the latter calls the young Jesus “a light for the revelation of the
Gentiles and the glory of the people of Israel,” the Buddhist prophet promises that the
young prince will find himself clothed with the perfect and complete <em>enlightenment</em> or
“light” of Buddha, and will turn the wheel <em>of law</em> as no one <em>ever did before him</em>.

 The fact is vouchsafed for by Epiphanius. See Hone: “Apocryphal New Testament;”
“The Gospel of the Birth of Mary.”</p>

<p class="footnote">In his able article “Bacchus, the Prophet-God,” Professor A. Wilder remarks
that “Tacitus was misled into thinking that the Jews worshipped an ass, the symbol
of Typhon or Seth, the Hyk-sos God. The Egyptian name of the ass was <i>eo</i>, the phonetic
of Iao;” and hence, probably, he adds, “a symbol from that mere circumstance.”
We can hardly agree with this learned archæologist, for the idea that the Jews reverenced,
for some mysterious reason, Typhon under his symbolical representation rests on
more proof than one. And for one we find a passage in the “Gospel of Mary,” is cited
from Epiphanius, which corroborates the fact. It relates to the death of “Zacharias,
the father of John the Baptist, murdered by Herod,” says the Protevangelion. Epiphanius
writes that the cause of the death of Zacharias was that upon seeing a
vision in the temple he, through surprise, was willing to disclose it, but his mouth was
stopped. That which he saw was at the time of his offering incense, and it was a man
<span class="allsmcap">STANDING IN THE FORM OF AN ASS</span>. When he was gone out, and had a mind to speak
thus to the people, <cite>Woe unto you, whom do ye worship?</cite> he who had appeared unto
him in the temple took away the use of his speech. Afterward when he recovered it,
and was able to speak, he declared this to the Jews, and they slew him. They (the
Gnostics) add in this book, that on this very account the high priest was commanded by
the law-giver (Moses) to carry little bells, that whensoever he went into the temple
to sacrifice, he <em>whom they worshipped</em>, hearing the noise of the bells, might have time
enough to hide himself, and not be caught in that ugly shape and figure” (<abbr title="Epiphanius">Epiph.</abbr>).</p>

 It would be worth the trouble of an artist, while travelling around the world, to
make a collection of the multitudinous varieties of Madonnas, Christs, saints, and martyrs
as they appear in various costumes in different countries. They would furnish

 Even as we write, there comes from Earl Salisbury, Secretary of State for India,
a report that the Madras famine is to be followed by one probably still more severe in
Southern India, the very district where the heaviest tribute has been exacted by the
Catholic missionaries for the expenses of the Church of Rome. The latter, unable to
retaliate otherwise, despoils British subjects, and when famine comes as a consequence,
makes the heretical British Government pay for it.</p>

 In his article on “Paul, the Founder of Christianity,” Professor A. Wilder,
whose intuitions of truth are always clear, says: “In the person of <i>Aher</i> we recognize
the Apostle Paul. He appears to have been known by a variety of appellations.
He was named <i>Saul</i>, evidently because of his vision of Paradise—Saul or <i>Sheol</i> being
the Hebrew name of the other world. <i>Paul</i>, which only means ‘the little man,’ was
a species of nickname. <i>Aher</i>, or <i>other</i>, was an epithet in the Bible for persons outside
of the Jewish polity, and was applied to him for having extended his ministry to the
Gentiles. His real name was Elisha ben Abuiah.”</p>

 This is the doctrine of the Supralapsarians, who asserted that “He [God] <em>predestinated
the fall of Adam</em>, with all its pernicious consequences, from all eternity, and
that our first parents had no liberty from the beginning.”</p>

<p class="footnote">It is also to this highly-moral doctrine that the Catholic world became indebted, in
the eleventh century, for the institution of the Order known as the Carthusian monks.
Bruno, its founder, was driven to the foundation of this monstrous Order by a circumstance
well worthy of being recorded here, as it graphically illustrates this <em>divine</em> predestination.
A friend of Bruno, a French physician, famed far and wide for his extraordinary
<em>piety</em>, <em>purity of morals</em>, and <em>charity</em>, died, and his body was watched by Bruno
himself. Three days after his death, and as he was going to be buried, the pious physician
suddenly sat up in his coffin and declared, in a loud and solemn voice, “that by the
just judgment of God he was eternally damned.” After which consoling message from
beyond the “dark river,” he fell back and relapsed into death.</p>

<p class="footnote">In their turn, the Parsi theologians speak thus: “If any of you commit sin under
the belief that he shall be saved by <em>somebody</em>, both the deceiver as well as the deceived
shall be damned to the day of Rasta Khéz.... There is no Saviour. In the other
world you shall receive the return according to your actions.... <em>Your Saviour is
your deeds</em> and God <span class="lock">Himself.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1063" id="FNanchor_1063">[1063]</a></span></p>

 Bunsen found some records which show the language and religious worship of the
Egyptians, for instance, not only existing at the opening of the old Empire, “but
already so fully established and fixed as to receive <em>but a very slight development</em> in the
course of the old, middle, and modern Empires,” and while this opening of the old
Empire is placed by him beyond the Menes period, at least 4,000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, the
origin of the ancient Hermetic prayers and hymns of the “Book of the Dead,” is
assigned by Bunsen to the pre-Menite dynasty of Abydos (between 4,000 and 4,500

 In an Address to the Delegates of the Evangelical Alliance, New York, 1874,

closes it with the following memorable language: “In that <em>last and final account</em> it
will be happy for us if we shall then find that our influence through life has tended to
feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, and soothe the sorrows of those who were sick
and in prison.” Such words from a man who has given two million dollars in charity;
educated four thousand young girls in useful arts, by which they gain a comfortable
support; maintained a free public library, museum, and reading-room; classes for working
people; public lectures by eminent scientists, open to all; and been foremost in all
good works, throughout a long and blameless life, come with the noble force that marks
the utterances of all benefactors of their kind. The deeds of Peter Cooper will cause
posterity to treasure his golden sayings in its heart.</p>

 Moses was a most notable practitioner of Hermetic Science. Bearing in mind
that Moses (Asarsiph) is made to run away to the Land of Midian, and that he “sat
down by a well” (<abbr title="Exodus two">Exod. ii.</abbr>), we find the following:</p>

<p class="footnote">The “Well” played a prominent part in the Mysteries of the Bacchic festivals.
In the sacerdotal language of every country, it had the same significance. A well is
“the fountain of salvation” mentioned in <cite>Isaiah</cite> (<abbr title="twelve">xii.</abbr> 3). The water is the <em>male
principle</em> in its spiritual sense. In its physical relation in the allegory of creation,
the water is chaos, and chaos is the female principle vivified by the Spirit of God—the
male principle. In the “Kabala,” <i>Zachar</i> means “male;” and the Jordan was called
Zachar (“Universal History,” <abbr title="volume two">vol. ii.</abbr>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 429). It is curious that the Father of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John
the Baptist, the Prophet of <i>Jordan</i>—Zacchar—should be called <i>Zachar-ias</i>. One of
the names of Bacchus is <i>Zagreus</i>. The ceremony of pouring water on the shrine was
sacred in the Osirian rites as well as in the Mosaic institutions. In the <cite>Mishna</cite> it is
said, “Thou shalt dwell in Succa and <em>pour out water</em> seven, and the pipes six days”
(“Mishna Succah,” <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 1). “Take <em>virgin earth</em> ... and work up the <em>dust</em> with <em>living</em>
<span class="allsmcap">WATER</span>,” prescribes the <cite>Sohar</cite> (Introduction to “Sohar;” “Kabbala Denudata,”
<abbr title="two, pages">ii., pp.</abbr> 220, 221). Only “earth and water, according to Moses, can bring forth a <em>living
soul</em>,” quotes Cornelius Agrippa. The water of Bacchus was considered to impart
the Holy <em>Pneuma</em> to the initiate; and it washes off all sin by baptism through the Holy
<em>Ghost</em>, with the Christians. The “well” in the kabalistic sense, is the mysterious
emblem of the <em>Secret Doctrine</em>. “If any man thirst, let him come <cite>unto me and
drink</cite>,” says Jesus (John <abbr title="seven">vii.</abbr>).</p>

<p class="footnote">Therefore, Moses the adept, is naturally enough represented sitting by a well. He
is approached by the <em>seven</em> daughters of the Kenite Priest of Midian coming to fill the
troughs, <em>to water their father’s flock</em>. Here we have seven again—the mystic number.
In the present biblical allegory the daughters represent the <em>seven occult powers</em>. “The
shepherds came and drove them (the seven daughters) away, but Moses stood up, and
helped them, and watered their flock.” The shepherds are shown, by some kabalistic
interpreters, to represent the seven “badly-disposed Stellars” of the Nazarenes; for in
the old Samaritan text the number of these Shepherds is also said to be seven (see
kabalistic books).</p>

<p class="footnote">Then Moses, who had conquered the seven <em>evil</em> Powers, and won the friendship of
the seven <em>occult</em> and beneficent ones, is represented as living with the Reuel Priest of
Midian, who invites “the Egyptian” to eat bread, <i>i.e.</i>, to partake of his wisdom. In
the Bible the elders of Midian are known as great soothsayers and diviners. Finally,
Reuel or Jethro, the initiator and instructor of Moses, gives him in marriage his
daughter. This daughter is Zipporah, <i>i.e.</i>, the esoteric Wisdom, the shining light of
knowledge, for Siprah means the “shining” or “resplendent,” from the word
“Sapar” to shine. Sippara, in Chaldea, was the city of the “Sun.” Thus Moses
was initiated by the Midianite, or rather the Kenite, and thence the biblical allegory.</p>

 “We divide our zeal,” says Dr. Henry More, “against so many things that we fancy
Popish, that we scarce reserve <em>a just share of detestation</em> against what is truly so.
Such are that gross, rank, and scandalous impossibility <em>of transubstantiation</em>, the various
modes of fulsome idolatry and lying impostures, the uncertainty of their loyalty to
their lawful sovereigns by their superstitious adhesion to the spiritual tyranny of the
Pope, and that <em>barbarous and ferine cruelty against those</em> that are not either such
fools as to be persuaded to believe such things as they would obtrude upon men, or,
are not so false to God and their own consciences, as, knowing better, yet to profess
them” (Postscript to “Glanvill”).</p>

 Payne Knight believes that Ceres was not a personification of the brute matter
which composed the earth, but of the female <em>productive principle</em> supposed to pervade
it, which, joined to the active, was held to be the cause of the organization and animation
of its substance.... She is mentioned as the wife of the Omnipotent Father, Æther,
or Jupiter (“The Symbolical Language of Ancient Art and Mythology,” <abbr title="thirty-six"> xxxvi</abbr>.). Hence
the words of Christ, “it is the Spirit that quickeneth, <em>flesh profiteth nothing</em>,” applied
in their dual meaning to both spiritual and terrestrial things, to spirit and matter.</p>

<p class="footnote">Bacchus, as Dionysus, is of Indian origin. Cicero mentions him as a son of Thyoné
and Nisus. Διόνυσος means the god Dis from Mount Nys in India. Bacchus, crowned
with ivy, or <i>kissos</i>, is Christna, one of whose names was <i>Kissen</i>. Dionysus is preëminently
the deity on whom were centred all the hopes for future life; in short, he was the god
who was expected to <em>liberate the souls of men</em> from their prisons of flesh. Orpheus,
the poet-Argonaut, is also said to have come on earth to purify the religion of its gross,
and terrestrial anthropomorphism, he abolished human sacrifice and instituted a mystic
theology based on pure spirituality. Cicero calls Orpheus a son of Bacchus. It is
strange that both seem to have originally come from India. At least, as Dionysus
Zagreus, Bacchus is of undoubted Hindu origin. Some writers deriving a curious analogy
between the name of Orpheus and an old Greek term, ὀρφος, <em>dark or tawny-colored</em>,
make him Hindu by connecting the term with his dusky Hindu complexion.

 The atrocious custom subsequently introduced among the people, of sacrificing
human victims, is a perverted copy of the Theurgic Mystery. The Pagan priests, who
did not belong to the class of the hierophants, carried on for awhile this hideous rite,
and it served to screen the genuine purpose. But the Grecian Herakles is represented
as the adversary of human sacrifices and as slaying the men and monsters who offered
them. Bunsen shows, by the very absence of any representation of human sacrifice on
the oldest monuments, that this custom had been abolished in the old Empire, at the close
of the seventh century after Menes; therefore, 3,000 years <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, Iphiscrates had stopped
the human sacrifices entirely among the Carthaginians. Diphilus ordered bulls to be
substituted for human victims. Amosis forced the priests to replace the latter by figures
of wax. On the other hand, for every stranger offered on the shrine of Diana by the
inhabitants of the Tauric Chersonesus, the Inquisition and the Christian clergy can
boast of a dozen of heretics offered on the altar of the “mother of God,” and her
“Son.” And when did the Christians ever think of substituting either animals or
wax-figures for living heretics, Jews, and witches? They burned these in effigy only
when, through providential interference, the doomed victims had escaped their clutches.</p>

 This is why Jesus recommends prayer in the solitude of one’s closet. This secret
prayer is but the <i>paravidya</i> of the Vedantic philosopher: “He who knows his soul
(inner self) daily retires to the region of <i>Swarga</i> (the heavenly realm) in his own heart,”
says the <i>Brihad-Aranyaka</i>. The Vedantic philosopher recognizes the Âtman, the
spiritual <em>self</em>, as the sole and Supreme God.</p>

 The Yezidis must number over 200,000 men altogether. The tribes which inhabit

as well as the most hated for their evil practices. Their chief Sheik lives constantly
near the tomb of their prophet and reformer Adi, but every tribe chooses its
own sheik among the most learned in the “black art.” This Adi or Ad is a mythic

 In a discourse of Hermes with Thoth, the former says: “It is impossible for
thought to rightly conceive of God.... One cannot describe, through material organs,
that which is immaterial and eternal.... One is a perception of the spirit, the other
a reality. That which can be perceived by our senses can be described in words; but
that which is incorporeal, invisible, immaterial, and without form cannot be realized
through our ordinary senses. I understand thus, O Thoth, I understand that God is
ineffable.”</p>

 His twenty or more volumes on Oriental subjects are indeed a curious conglomerate
of truth and fiction. They contain a vast deal of fact about Indian traditions,
philosophy and chronology, with most just views courageously expressed. But it seems
as if the philosopher were constantly being overlaid by the romancist. It is as though
two men were united in their authorship—one careful, serious, erudite, scholarly, the
other a sensational and sensual French romancer, who judges of facts not as they are
but as <em>he</em> imagines them. His translations from <cite>Manu</cite> are admirable; his controversial
ability marked; his views of priestly morals unfair, and in the case of the Buddhists,
positively slanderous. But in all the series of volumes there is not a line of dull reading;
he has the eye of the artist, the pen of the poet of nature.</p>

 In its general sense, <i>Isvara</i> means “Lord;” but the Isvara of the mystic philosophers
of India was understood precisely as the union and communion of men with the
Deity of the Greek mystics. <i>Isvara-Parasada</i> means, literally, in Sanscrit, <i>grace</i>.
Both of the “Mimansas,” treating of the most abstruse questions, explain <i>Karma</i> as
merit, or the <i>efficacy of works</i>; Isvara-Parasada, as grace; and <i>Sradha</i>, as faith.
The “Mimansas” are the work of the two most celebrated theologians of India. The
“Pourva-Mimansa” was written by the philosopher Djeminy, and the “Outtara-Mimansa”
(or Vedanta), by Richna Dvipayaa Vyasa, who collected the four
“Vedas” together. (See Sir William Jones, Colebrooke, and others.)</p>

 The Boulogne (France) correspondent of an English journal says that he knows
of a gentleman who has had an arm amputated at the shoulder, “who is certain
that he has a spiritual arm, which he sees and actually feels with his other hand.
He can touch anything, and even pull up things with the spiritual or phantom
arm and hand.” The party knows nothing of spiritualism. We give this as we
get it, without verification, but it merely corroborates what we have seen in the
case of an Eastern adept. This eminent scholar and practical kabalist can at will project
his astral arm, and with the hand take up, move, and carry objects, even at a considerable
distance from where he may be sitting or standing. We have often seen him
thus minister to the wants of a favorite elephant.</p>

 A Bikshu is not allowed to accept anything directly even from laymen of his own
people, least of all from a foreigner. The slightest contact with the body and even
dress of a person not belonging to their special community is carefully avoided.
Thus even the offerings brought by us and which comprised pieces of red and yellow
<i>pou-lou</i>, a sort of woollen fabric the lamas generally wear, had to pass through strange
ceremonies. They are forbidden, 1, to ask or beg for anything—even were they starving—having
to wait until it is voluntarily offered; 2, to touch either gold or silver with
their hands; 3, to eat a morsel of food, even when presented, unless the donor distinctly
says to the disciple, “This is for your master to <em>eat</em>.” Thereupon, the disciple
turning to the <i>pazen</i> has to offer the food in his turn, and when he has said, “Master,
this is allowed; take and eat,” then only can the lama take it with the right hand, and
partake of it. All our offerings had to pass through such purifications. When the
silver pieces, and a few handfuls of annas (a coin equal to four cents) were at different
occasions offered to the community, a disciple first wrapped his hand in a yellow handkerchief,
and receiving it on his palm, conveyed the sum immediately into the <i>Badir</i>,
called elsewhere <i>Sabaït</i>, a sacred basin, generally wooden, kept for offerings.</p>

 These stones are highly venerated among Lamaists and Buddhists; the throne
and sceptre of Buddha are ornamented with them, and the Taley Lama wears one on
the fourth finger of the right hand. They are found in the Altai Mountains, and near
the river Yarkuh. Our talisman was a gift from the venerable high-priest, a <i>Heiloung</i>,
of a Kalmuck tribe. Though treated as apostates from their primitive Lamaism,
these nomads maintain friendly intercourse with their brother Kalmucks, the Chokhots
of Eastern Thibet and Kokonor, but even with the Lamaists of Lha-Ssa. The ecclesiastical
authorities however, will have no relations with them. We have had abundant
opportunities to become acquainted with this interesting people of the Astrakhan
Steppes, having lived in their <i>Kibitkas</i> in our early years, and partaken of the lavish
hospitality of the Prince Tumene, their late chief, and his Princess. In their religious
ceremonies, the Kalmucks employ trumpets made from the thigh and arm bones of
deceased rulers and high priests.</p>

 There was an anecdote current among Daguerre’s friends between 1838 and 1840.
At an evening party, Madame Daguerre, some two months previous to the introduction
of the celebrated Daguerrean process to the <i>Académie des Sciences</i>, by Arago (January,
1839), had an earnest consultation with one of the medical celebrities of the day
about her husband’s mental condition. After explaining to the physician the numerous
symptoms of what she believed to be her husband’s mental aberration, she added, with
tears in her eyes, that the greatest proof to her of Daguerre’s insanity was his firm conviction
that he would succeed in nailing his own shadow to the wall, or fixing it on
<em>magical</em> metallic plates. The physician listened to the intelligence very attentively,
and answered that he had himself observed in Daguerre lately the strongest symptoms
of what, to his mind, was an undeniable proof of madness. He closed the conversation
by firmly advising her to send her husband quietly and without delay to Bicétre, the
well-known lunatic asylum. Two months later a profound interest was created in the
world of art and science by the exhibition of a number of pictures taken by the new process.
The <em>shadows</em> were fixed, after all, upon metallic plates, and the “lunatic”
proclaimed the father of photography.</p>

 No country in the world can boast of more medicinal plants than Southern India,
Cochin, Burmah, Siam, and Ceylon. European physicians—according to time-honored
practice—settle the case of professional rivalship, by treating the native doctors as
quacks and empirics; but this does not prevent the latter from being often successful in
cases in which eminent graduates of British and French schools of Medicine have signally
failed. Native works on Materia Medica do not certainly contain the secret remedies
known, and successfully applied by the native doctors (the Atibbā), from time immemorial;
and yet the best febrifuges have been learned by British physicians from the
Hindus, and where patients, deafened and swollen by abuse of quinine, were slowly dying
of fever under the treatment of enlightened physicians, the bark of the Margosa, and the
Chiretta herb have cured them completely, and these now occupy an honorable place
among European drugs.</p>

 Between the bells of the “heathen” worshippers, and the bells and pomegranates
of the Jewish worship, the difference is this: the former, besides purifying the soul
of man with their harmonious tones, kept <em>evil</em> demons at a distance, “for the sound
of pure bronze breaks the enchantment,” says Tibullius (<abbr title="one">i.</abbr>, 8-22), and the latter explained
it by saying that the sound of the bells “should be heard [by the Lord] when
he [the priest] goeth in unto the holy place before the Lord, and when he goeth out,
<em>that he die not</em>” (Exodus <abbr title="twenty-eight">xxviii.</abbr> 33; <abbr title="Ecclesiastes fourteen">Eccles. xiv.</abbr> 9). Thus, one sound served to keep
away <em>evil</em> spirits, and the other, the Spirit of Jehovah. The Scandinavian traditions
affirm that the Trolls were always driven from their abodes by the bells of the churches.
A similar tradition is in existence in relation to the fairies of Great Britain.</p>

known as the Guebres, who assemble from time to time at Baku, on the
“field of fire.” This ancient and mysterious town is situated near the Caspian Sea. It
belongs to Russian Georgia. About twelve miles northeast from Baku stands the remnant
of an ancient Guebre temple, consisting of four columns, from whose empty orifices
issue constantly jets of flame, which gives it, therefore, the name of Temple of the Perpetual
Fire. The whole region is covered with lakes and springs of naphtha. Pilgrims
assemble there from distant parts of Asia, and a priesthood, worshipping the divine
principle of fire, is kept by some tribes, scattered hither and thither about the country.</p>

<p class="smaller">The recent revival of interest in Philology and Archæology, resulting from the labors of

and others, has created a great demand
for works upon Eastern topics.</p>

<p class="smaller">To the scholar and the specialist, to the philologist and the archæologist, this work will be a
most valuable acquisition, aiding them in their labors and giving to them the only clue to the
labyrinth of confusion in which they are involved. To the general reader it will be especially
attractive because of its fascinating style and pleasing arrangement, presenting a constant variety
of racy anecdote, pithy thought, sound scholarship, and vivid description. Mme. <span class="smcap">Blavatsky</span>
possesses the happy gift of versatility in an eminent degree, and her style is varied to suit her
theme with a graceful ease refreshing to the reader, who is led without weariness from page to
page. The author has accomplished her task with ability, and has conferred upon all a precious
boon, whose benefit the scientist as well as the religionist, the specialist as well as the general
reader, will not be slow to recognize.</p>

<p class="smaller">“His <cite>Bible of Humanity</cite> is a large epic in prose. The artist-historian, in the manner of inspired

he carries away the reader with such rapid flight of imagination as almost to make him giddy.”—<cite>Larousse’s

<p class="smaller">The extreme rarity, and consequent high price of the “Anacalypsis” has hitherto placed it
beyond the reach of many scholars and students. The new edition is issued in a much more convenient
form, and sold at less than one-sixth of the price of the original.</p>

<p class="smaller">The powerful though rather dogmatic logic, and the profound learning of the author, give the
work a singular importance; and in a thinking age, when many things formerly considered truths
are passing away into the shadows of tradition, the student of comparative mythology and the
origin of religion and languages will look upon Higgins’ Anacalypsis as his guide and luminary
through the darkness of dawning science.</p>

of the artist, though to be examined by other principles and addressed to a narrower circle, equally
claim approbation, sometimes excite our wonder, and not seldom our fears, when we see him play on
the very verge of legitimate invention; but wildness so picturesque in itself, so often redeemed by taste,
simplicity, and elegance, what child of fancy—what artist—would wish to discharge? The groups and
single figures on their own basis, abstracted from the general composition and considered without
attention to the plan, frequently exhibit those genuine and unaffected attitudes—those simple graces—which
nature and the heart alone can dictate, and only an eye inspired by both discover. <i>Every class
of artists, in every stage of their progress or attainments, from the student to the finished
master, and from the contriver of ornament to the painter of history, will find here materials
of art and hints of improvement.</i>”—<cite>Cromek.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“This is a pleasant gossipy book, full of wise saws, if not of modern instances. It may be considered
one of the earliest English jest books. The wit in it is not as startling as fireworks, but there
is a good deal of grave, pleasant humor, and many of those touches of nature which make the whole
world kin. When Nicholas Udall undertook to translate this work he was the right man in the right
place. Probably no old English book so abounds with colloquialisms and idiomatic expressions. It is
very valuable on that account. This reprint has been made from the second edition, that of 1562.
The reprint is literal; the only difference being that, to make it easier for the general reader, the contractions
have been filled in, and the Greek quotations, which were exceedingly incorrect, have been,
in most cases, put right.”</p>

<p class="smaller">This is a presentation of the facts and verities of Christianity from the earliest
monuments and contemporary literature. These include the paintings, sculptures,
sarcophagi, glasses, lamps, seal-rings, and inscriptions of the Christian Catacombs and
elsewhere, as well as the mosaics of the earliest Christian churches. Many of these
monuments are evidently of Pagan origin, as are also the symbols; and the author has
drawn largely from the ancient religions of India, Chaldea, Persia, Egypt, Etruria,
Greece, and Rome, believing that they all contained germs of religious truths which
it is the province of Christianity to preserve, develop, and embody in a purer
system. The Apostles’ Creed is exhibited, with its parallel or counterpart, article by
article, in the different systems thus brought under review.</p>

<p class="smaller">The book is profusely illustrated, and many of the monuments presented in facsimile
were studied on the spot by the author, and several are specimens obtained in
foreign travel. This is one of the most valuable contributions to ecclesiastical and
archæological literature. The revival of Oriental learning, both in Europe and America,
has created a demand for such publications, but no one has occupied the field which
Dr. Lundy has chosen. The Expositions which he has made of the symbols and
mysteries are thorough without being exhaustive; and he has carefully excluded a
world of collateral matter, that the attention might not be diverted from the main
object of the work. Those who may not altogether adopt his conclusions will
nevertheless find the information which he has imparted most valuable and interesting.</p>

Polychrome.</i>—Racinet gives the word ‘costume’ almost as wide a sweep of meaning as Viollet-le-Duc
gives to furniture in his now famous <cite>Dictionnaire du Mobilier</cite>. * * * * The field surveyed consists
not only of costumes proper, but of arms, armor, drinking vessels, objects used in the service of
the church, modes of transport, harness, head-gear and modes of dressing the hair, domestic interiors,
and furniture in the ordinary acceptation of the term. Each plate is to be accompanied with an explanatory
text, and there will be added an historical study, so that little will be wanting to make this one of
the completest encyclopædias of the sort that has ever appeared. * * * * A charming taste has
presided over the selection of the subject, and the abundant learning that has been brought to bear in
the collection of illustrations, from so wide a field of human action, is made to seem like play, so lightly
is it handled. * * * * No scientific arrangement is observed in the order in which the subjects
are presented. We have ancient Egypt, Assyria, Rome, Greece, India, Europe in the middle ages,
and from the fifteenth to the eighteenth centuries, Japan, Turkey, Syria, Russia, and Poland, mixed
up for the present, as if the work were an illustrated report of a fancy ball; and, to most of us, the gay

the glaring inconsistencies we still see from time to time on the stage, where periods as to costume, some
hundreds of years apart, are terribly mixed up, might be prevented, and the unities saved. The publishers
have had the excellent idea of reducing the size of the illustrations, so as to bring the price of
this picture-cyclopædia of the costume of the world within the means of the most prudent book-buyer.”—<cite>N.

<p class="smaller">“This work is unquestionably the best work on its subject ever offered to the public, and it will engage

<p class="smaller">“Not only do these explanations afford a key to the religion and mythology of the ancients, but
they also enable a more thorough understanding of the canons and principles of art. It is well known
that the latter was closely allied to the other; so that the symbolism of which the religious emblems and
furniture consisted likewise constituted the essentials of architectural style and decoration, textile embellishments,
as well as the arts of sculpture, painting, and engraving. Mr. Knight has treated the
subject with rare erudition and ingenuity, and with such success that the labor of those who come after
him rather add to the results of his investigations than replace them in important particulars. The
labors of Champollion, Bunsen, Layard, Bonomi, the Rawlinsons, and others, comprise his deductions
so remarkably as to dissipate whatever of his assertions that appeared fanciful. Not only are the
writings of Greek and Roman authors now more easy to comprehend, but additional light has been
afforded to a correct understanding of the canon of the Holy Scripture.”—<cite>Extract from Editor’s

</div>

<p class="smaller">This work is most aptly expressed by the title, and the author, who is one of our most learned and
accomplished modern writers, has done ample justice to his subject. He pries boldly into Bluebeard’s
closet, little recking whether he shall find a ghost, skeleton, or a living being; and he tells us very
bluntly and explicitly what he has witnessed. Several years since he gave to the learned world his
treatise on <cite>Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names</cite>, in which were disclosed the ideas underlying
the old-world religions, and the nature of hieroglyphical symbols employed in the East. The
present volume complements that work, elaborates more perfectly the ideas there set forth, and traces
their relations to the faiths, worship, and religious dogmas of modern time. We are astonished to
find resemblances where it would be supposed that none would exist, betraying either a similar origin
or analogous modes of thinking and reasoning among nations and peoples widely apart in race,
country, and period of history. The author is bold and often strong in his expressions, from the
intensity of his convictions, but this serves to deepen the interest in his subject. Those who have read
his former works with advantage will greet this volume with a cordial welcome; and all who desire
to understand the original religions of mankind, the ideas which lie back of the revelations of Holy
Scripture, and particularly, those who are not easily shocked when they come in contact with sentiments
with which they have not been familiar, will find this book full of entertainment as well as of
instruction. Dr. Inman is working up a new mine of thought, and the lover of knowledge will give his
labor a welcome which few of our modern authors receive.</p>

<p class="smaller">“Dr. Inman’s present attempt to trace the religious belief, sacred rites, and holy emblems of certain
nations, has opened up to him many hitherto unexplored fields of research, or, at least, fields that
have not been over-cultivated, and the result is a most curious and miscellaneous harvest of facts.
The ideas on priapism developed in a former volume receive further extension in this. Dr. Inman, as
will be seen, does not fear to touch subjects usually considered sacred in an independent manner, and
some of the results at which he has arrived are such as will undoubtedly startle, if not shock, the
orthodox. But this is what the author expects, and for this he has thoroughly prepared himself. In
illustration of his peculiar views he has ransacked a vast variety of historical storehouses, and with
great trouble and at a considerable cost, he places the conclusions at which he has arrived before the
world. With the arguments employed, the majority of readers will, we expect, disagree; even when
the facts adduced will remain undisputed, their application is frequently inconsequent. In showing
the absurdity of a narrative or an event in which he disbelieves, the Doctor is powerful. No expense
has been spared on the work, which is well and fully illustrated, and contains a good index.”—<cite>Bookseller.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">The favor with which this treatise has been received has induced the publisher to bring out a new
edition. It makes a valuable addition to our knowledge, enabling us to acquire a more accurate perception
of the ancient-world religions. We may now understand Phallism, not as a subject of ribaldry
and leering pruriency, but as a matter of veneration and respect. The Biblical student, desirous to
understand the nature and character of the idolatry of the Israelites during the Commonwealth and
Monarchy, the missionary to heathen lands fitting for his work, and the classic scholar endeavoring to
comprehend the ideas and principles which underlie Mythology, will find their curiosity gratified; and
they will be enabled at the same time to perceive how not only many of our modern systems of
religion, but our arts and architecture, are to be traced to the same archaic source. The books examined
and quoted by the authors constitute a library by themselves, and their writers are among the
ripest scholars of their time. Science is rending asunder the veil that conceals the adytum of every
temple, and revealing to men the sanctities revered so confidingly during the world’s childhood.
With these disclosures, there may be somewhat of the awe removed with which we have regarded the
symbols, mysteries, and usages of that period; but the true mind will not be vulgarized by the
spectacle.</p>

<p class="smaller">In the Mysteries, the dramas acted at Eleusis and other sacred places, were embodied the deeper
thoughts and religious sentiment of the archaic world. The men and women initiated into them were
believed to be thenceforth under special care of God, for this life and the future. So holy and interior
were the doctrines considered which had been learned in the Sanctuary from the two tablets of stone,
that it was not lawful to utter them to another. What was seen and learned elsewhere might be admirable;
but the exercises of Eleusis and Olympia had in them the something divine, and those who
observed them were “the children of God,” and imaging Him in wisdom, intuitive discernment, and
love.</p>

<p class="smaller">The reader desirous of getting the kernel of the doctrines of Plato, Orpheus, Eumolpas, and their
fellow-laborers, as well as of the Alexandrian Eclectics, will obtain invaluable aid from this treatise.

<p class="smaller">This book contains in a nutshell the essence of Dr. Inman’s other publications, and for the
reader of limited means is just what he requires. The subject of symbolism is as deep as human
thought and as broad in its scope as humanity itself. The erudite thinker finds it not only worthy of
his best energies, but capable of taxing them to the utmost. Many pens have been employed upon it,
and it has never grown old. Dr. Inman’s views are somewhat peculiar; he has concentrated his
attention to the ideas which he believes to underlie the symbolism of the most ancient periods, and
can be traced through the autonomy of the Christian Church. He finds the relation which exists, and
the antiquarian likewise, between Asshur and Jehovah, the Baal of Syria and the God whom Christians
worship; and the mysteries of the Sacred Grove, of which the Old Testament says so much, are
unfolded and made sensible to the common intellect. Scholars will welcome this volume, and the
religious reader will peruse its pages with the profoundest interest. The symbols which characterize
worship constitute a study which will never lose its interest, so long as learning and art have admirers.</p>

</div>

<p class="smaller">Words change as well as men, sometimes from no longer meeting the new wants of the people, but
oftener from the attraction of novelty which impels everybody to change. A dictionary of obsolete
words, and terms becoming obsolete, is a valuable reminder of the treasures which we are parting
with; not always wisely, for in them are comprised a wealth of expression, idiom, and even history,
which the new words cannot acquire. Dr. Mackay has placed a host of such on record, with quotations
to illustrate how they were read by the classical writers of the English language, not many centuries
ago, and enables us to read those authors more understandingly. If he could induce us to
recall some of them back to life, it would be a great boon to literature; but hard as it might have
been for Cæsar to add a new word to his native Latin language, it would have been infinitely more
difficult to resuscitate an obsolete one, however more expressive and desirable. Many of the terms
embalmed in this treatise are not dead as yet: and others of them belong to that prolific department
of our spoken language that does not get into dictionaries. But we all need to know them; and they
really are more homogeneous to our people than their successors, the stilted foreign-born and alien
English, that “the Best” is laboring to naturalize into our language. The old words, like old shoes
and well-worn apparel, sit most comfortably.</p>

A SUPERB SERIES OF ETCHINGS.<br>

<div class="blockquot tall">
<p>Collection de M. John W. Wilson. Exposée dans la
Galerie du Cercle Artistique et Littéraire de Bruxelles, au
profit des pauvres de cette Ville. Troisième édition.
Handsomely printed on heavy paper, and illustrated with
a series of 68 large and most exquisitely executed etchings,
from the most remarkable pictures in this celebrated
collection. <span class="smcap">Fine Impressions.</span> Thick royal <abbr title="quarto">4to</abbr>, paper,
uncut, $25.00; or in half morocco, gilt tops, uncut, $30.00.</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller">∵ Already out of print and scarce.</p>

<p class="smaller">This charming catalogue was gotten up at the expense of the generous owner of the collection, and
the money received from its sale donated to the fund for the relief of the poor of the city. The
edition consisted of 1,000 copies. It was immediately exhausted.</p>

<p class="smaller">The Catalogue is a model of its kind. The notices are in most instances accompanied with a fac-simile
of the artist’s signature to the picture; a biographical sketch of the artist; notices of the engraved
examples, if any; and critical notes on each picture.</p>

<p class="smaller">The graphic department is, however, the great feature of this Catalogue, embracing, as it does,
upwards of sixty examples of the best etchers of the present day, including Greux, Chauvel, Martial,
Rajon, Gaucherel, Jacquemart, Hédouin, Lemaire, Duclos, Masson, Flameng, Lalanne, Gilbert,
etc., etc.</p>


<p class="p2 unindent muchlarger">Dürer’s “Little Passion.”</p>

<div class="blockquot tall">
<p>Passio Christi. A complete set of the Thirty-seven
Woodcuts, by Albert Dürer. Reproduced in fac-simile.
Edited by W. C. Prime. One volume, Royal <abbr title="quarto">4to</abbr> (13 × 10½
inches). Printed on heavy glazed paper, half vellum,
$10.00. Morocco antique, $15.00.</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller">The Little Passion of Albert Dürer, consisting of thirty-seven woodcuts, has long been regarded
as one of the most remarkable collections of illustrations known to the world. Complete sets of the
entire series are excessively rare. The editions which have been published in modern times in Europe
are defective, lacking more or less of the Plates, and are of an inferior and unsatisfactory class of
workmanship.</p>

<div class="blockquot tall">

<p>With 56 illustrations, from designs by Henry L. Stephens.
Royal <abbr title="quarto">4to</abbr>, cloth extra, gilt leaves, $10.00.</p>
</div>

<p class="smaller">Mr. Stephens has no superior in the peculiar style of illustration which is most effective in bringing
out the spirit of Æsop’s Fables, and in this volume he has given us fifty-six full page cartoons,
brimming with droll humor, reciting the Fables over again, and enforcing their morals just as effectively
as was done by the words of Æsop himself. The illustrations are among the finest specimens of
art ever produced in this country, and the volume as a whole is most creditable to American artistic
skill.</p>

<p class="smaller">“But what obtained Mr. D’Urfey his greatest reputation was a peculiarly happy knack he possessed
in the writing of satires and irregular odes. Many of these were upon temporary occasions,
and were of no little service to the party in whose cause he wrote; which, together with his natural
vivacity and good humor, obtained him the favor of great numbers, of all ranks and conditions,
monarchs themselves not excluded. He was strongly attached to the Tory interest, and in the latter
part of Queen Anne’s reign had frequently the honor of diverting that princess with witty catches and
songs of humor suited to the spirit of the times, written by himself, and which he sang in a lively and
entertaining manner. And the author of the Guardian, who, in <abbr title="Number">No.</abbr> 67. has given a very humorous
account of Mr. D’Urfey, with a view to recommend him to the public notice for a benefit play, tells
us that he remembered King Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> leaning on Tom D’Urfey’s shoulder more than once, and
humming over a song with him.</p>

<p class="smaller">“He appears to have been a diverting companion, and a cheerful, honest, good-natured man; so
that he was the delight of the most polite companies in conversations, from the beginning of Charles
II.’s to the latter part of King George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>’s reign; and many an honest gentleman got a reputation in
his country by pretending to have been in company with Tom D’Urfey.”—<cite>Chalmers.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">∵ Of the Poets of the Restoration, there are none whose works are more rare than those of Sir
John Mennis and Dr. James Smith. The small volume entitled “Musarum Deliciæ; or, The Muses’
Recreation,” which contains the production of these two friends, was not accessible to Mr. Freeman
when he compiled his “Kentish Poets,” and has since become so rare that it is only found in the
cabinets of the curious. A reprint of the “Musarum Deliciæ,” together with several other kindred
pieces of the period, appeared in 1817, forming two volumes of Facetiæ, edited by Mr. E. Dubois,
author of “The Wreath,” etc. These volumes having in turn become exceedingly scarce, the Publishers
venture to put forth the present new edition, in which, while nothing has been omitted, no pains
have been spared to render it more complete and elegant than any that has yet appeared. The type,
plates, and woodcuts of the originals have been accurately followed; the Notes of the editor of 1817
are considerably augmented, and indexes have been added, together with a portrait of Sir John
Mennis, from a painting by Vandyke in Lord Clarendon’s Collection.

<p class="smaller">The above work condenses in a lively narrative form a most astonishing mass of curious and recondite
information in regard to the subject of which it treats. From the bludgeon of Cain to the truncheon
of the Marshals of France, from the budding rod of Aaron to the blazing cane of M. de Balzac,
the stick, in all its relations with man since first he meddled with the Tree of Knowledge of Good
and Evil, is shown here to have played a far greater part in history than is commonly imagined. It
has been the instrument of justice, it has been the tool also of luxury. It has ministered to man, its
maker, pleasure as well as pain, and has served for his support as well as for his subjugation. The
mysteries in which it has figured are some of them revealed and others of them hinted in these most
entertaining and instructive pages, for between the days of the society of Assassins in the East and
those of the society of the Aphrodites in the West, the Stick has been made the pivot of many secret
associations, all of them interesting to the student of human morals, but not all of them wisely to be
treated of before the general public. The late Mr. Buckle especially collected on this subject some
most astounding particulars of social history, which he did not live to handle in his own inimitable
way, but of which an adequate inkling is here afforded to the serious and intelligent reader.</p>

<p class="smaller">Enthusiasts are easily duped, and of all enthusiasts, excepting the religious, those who give themselves
up to the worship of some great poet or artist are the easiest prey of the impostor. To them, a
book, a letter, the least scrap or relic which is connected directly, or it would seem indirectly, with
their idol, is an inestimable treasure, and they are uneasy until it is in their possession, or removed
hopelessly beyond their reach. Of all these enthusiasts the “Shakspearians” are, and for a hundred
years have been, at once the most numerous, and the most easily, because the most willingly, deceived.
To their craving and their greed we owe the “Ireland Forgeries,” which were merely an impudent
attempt to supply a demand—an attempt made by a clever, ignorant young scamp, who succeeded in
deluding the whole body of them in England two generations ago. His “Confessions” are the
simply told story of this stupendous imposture: and the book—long out of print and scarce—is one
the most <i>naïf</i> and amusing of its kind in the whole history of literature. His exhibition of the
“gulls,” whom he made his victims, is equally delightful and instructive; and chiefly so, because of
his simplicity and frankness. He conceals nothing, palliates nothing; tells the whole story of his
ridiculous iniquity, and leaves a lasting lesson to the whole tribe of credulous collectors, Shakspearian
and others.</p>

Spanish bigotry, and Flemish barbarism of thieves and gipsys, contrabandists and brigands, paupers,
charcoal-burners and snow-gatherers, the Alhambra still exists—one of the most recent of
European ruins. It is the most perfect in repair and the richest in design; it has suffered less from
man, or the elements, and has fallen more gently into decay. It was not molten like Nineveh in an
hour, or buried in a day like Pompeii; it was not smitten down at a blow like Corinth, or sapped for
centuries like Athens. Though it has been alternately a barrack, a prison, a tea garden, and an
almshouse—though its harem has been a hen-house, its prisons pens for sheep; the Alhambra is still
one of the most wonderful productions of Eastern splendor, lingering in Europe long after the Moslem
waves have rolled back into Asia, like a golden cup dropped on the sand, or like the last tent of
some dead Arab, still standing, when the rest of his tribe have long since taken up their spears, untethered
their camels, and sought their new homes in the far desert.”</p>

<p class="smaller">The Editor of this work, M. Dupont-Auberville, is known as one of the most distinguished archæologists
of modern France, and Textile Art is the department of archæology to which he has devoted
the best years of his life. His collection of specimens of textile fabrics embraces models taken from all
ages and from all countries, and is admitted by all artists to be unique in every respect.</p>

<p class="smaller">The works of ancient textile art, both in the East and the West, are done full justice to, but at the
same time the framer of “Ornamental Textile Fabrics” has drawn more amply from the extensive
stock of models belonging to more recent periods. From his immense collection of specimens taken
from the Renaissance and the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, he has selected those subjects
which are most worthy of the attention both of the amateur and the manufacturer. In this manner the
work now submitted to the public is not a mere ornamental one, but at the same time it possesses a
practical usefulness which must cause it to be valued by all who make a study of taste in manufacturing
industry in general, and the art of weaving in particular.</p>

</div>

<p class="smaller">“No engraver who ever lived has so completely identified himself with painters he had to interpret
as Professor Unger in the seventy-two plates which compose his ‘Works.’ He can adopt at
will the most opposite styles, and work on each with ease, a fluency such as other men can only
attain in one manner—their own—and after half a lifetime. Indeed, one would not be going far
wrong to describe Professor Unger as an art critic of very uncommon insight, who explains the
sentiment and execution of great painters with an etching needle instead of a pen.</p>

<p class="smaller">“It has been said of engraving that it is an unintellectual occupation, because it is simply
copyism; but such engraving as this is not unintellectual, for it proves a delicacy and keenness of
understanding which are both rare among artists and critics. Unger has not the narrowness of
the ordinary artist, for he can enter into the most opposite styles; nor has he the technical ignorance
of the ordinary critic, for he can draw—I will not say like a great master, but like twenty
different great masters.</p>

<p class="smaller">“Mr. Vosmaer, the now well-known Dutch critic, who writes in English and French as well
as in his own language, has much increased the interest in Unger’s etchings by accompanying
them with a valuable biographic essay of his own, much superior to the ordinary ‘letter-press,’
which publishers in general appear to consider as a necessary companion to engraving.</p>

<p class="smaller">“The seventy-two etchings before us are, on the whole, the most remarkable set of studies
from old masters which has been issued by the enterprise of our modern publishers, and they can
hardly fail to make fine work better appreciated both by artists and amateurs.</p>

<p class="smaller">“A few words of praise are due to the spirited publisher, Mr. Sijthoff, of Leyden, for the
manner in which these etchings of Unger have been published. They are printed on fine Dutch
paper, and mounted (pasted by the upper edge only) on sufficiently good boards in such a manner
as to enter into the most carefully arranged collections without further change. They are accompanied
by a text printed with the greatest taste, on very fine Dutch paper. This series is printed
in one class of proof only, and issued at a price that is most reasonable, and Mr. Sijthoff deserves
our thanks for placing works of real art, thoroughly well got up, within the reach of cultivated
people who have limited incomes.</p>

<p class="smaller">“We recommend them strongly to all artists and lovers of art as a valuable means of art education
and a source of enduring pleasure.”—<span class="smcap">Hamerton</span> in the <cite>International Review</cite> for Jan., 1876.</p>

<p class="smaller">“They who know the Dutch painter Hals only through the few portraits by him which have
reached this country have but a slight comparative acquaintance with his works. ‘A stranger to
all academical lore, to all literary co-operation,’ writes Mr. Vosmaer, ‘Frans Hals appeared merely
as a portrait-painter, like most of the modern artists of his youth ... true to life, but also excelling
by naturalness and masterly handling. Subsequently he portrayed the joyous popular life of
the streets and the tavern; at last those phases of national social life, which have at once their
image and memorial in the pictures of the arquebusiers and the civic governors.’”—<cite>London Art
Journal</cite>, Aug. 1873.</p>

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.<br>
</p>

<p class="smaller">“Nowhere but in Paris could such a Review be produced every week as <cite>L’Art</cite>, so magnificent
in every respect, paper, typography, illustrations, and above all, so many sided in its view of art, and
so abundant and interesting in its information. It has now been brought to the fourth year of its life,
with every sign of assured and increasing vigor, and we are glad to learn, from the report of the editor
to the subscribers, that something more substantial than the <i>succès d’estime</i> has rewarded the
experiment of such a costly venture.... It is simply the cheapest and the best thing of its kind.
M. Véron seems, at any rate, to have solved the problem of combining excellence with cheapness.
We find, besides numerous little facsimiles of sketches, and autograph letters of eminent artists,
musicians, and dramatists, no less than seventy fine etchings by such men as Flameng, Courtry,
Desbrosses, Lançon, etc., and woodcuts of Claude’s and Turner’s pictures, with a series of very remarkable
copies of the famous tapestries at Madrid, from the designs of Albrecht Dürer and Van
Eyck, by Edmond Yon, Perrichon, and C. Maurand, as well as singularly fine examples of wood engraving.
Supposing the reading matter of the Review were as ephemeral and trivial in its purpose
as the cheapest of the cheap instead of being, as it is, rich and racy, with the native style of all French
pens, thoughtful and often profoundly suggestive, and generally complete, in reference to detail, the
two etchings by Flameng, from pictures by Frans Hals and Nicholas Maas, alone would be really
most valuable and acceptable to the print-collector.... While <cite>L’Art</cite> is conducted in this style
the editor may feel quite secure that France will not lose that artistic supremacy she has long held.”—<cite>London
Times.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“It would be easy and pleasant to go on discoursing about the pictures in <cite>L’Art</cite>, a paper which
is so full of good, sober, and just criticisms, trustworthy news about art, and designs not otherwise to
be obtained by most people.”—<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“The new volume of <cite>L’Art</cite> sufficiently manifests the success of a very valuable and interesting
publication.... There is no other journal in existence which so happily and skilfully combines
the labors of artists and authors which does not subordinate art to letters, or letters to art, but permits
them to go ‘hand in hand, not one before another.’... In brief, this grand folio volume of <cite>L’Art</cite>
abounds in matters of interest to all readers and students of æsthetic and cultivated taste.”—<cite>The
World</cite> (London).</p>

<p class="smaller">“There is some monotony in praising each successive portion of a periodical as it appears with an
absolutely equal cordiality; but the evenness of merit in <cite>L’Art</cite> makes this uniformity of commendation
a duty.”—<cite>The Nation.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“America is so destitute of illustrated works which can at all compare with <cite>L’Art</cite> that she cannot
do better than study and enjoy this French publication. Certainly there is no other means by which
so many valuable pictures can be obtained at so small a price.”—<cite>The Christian Union.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 unindent muchlarger">The Portfolio:</p>

<div class="blockquot tall">
<p>An Artistic Periodical, edited by <span class="smcap">Philip Gilbert
Hamerton</span>. Illustrated with Etchings, Autotypes, Woodcuts,
Facsimiles, Engravings, Heliogravures, etc. <i>Published
monthly.</i></p>

<p>Subscription reduced to <span class="smcap">Ten Dollars</span> per annum.</p>

<p>∴ <i>Sent, Postage free, to any part of the United States,

</div>

<p class="smaller">“The chief intention of ‘The Portfolio’ is to supply to its subscribers, at a lower cost than would
be possible without the certain sale of a regular periodical circulation, Works of Art of various kinds,
but always such as are likely to interest a cultivated public; and to accompany them with literature by
writers of proved ability, superior to mere letter-press, and more readable than pure criticism or cataloguing.”
Among the artists who have furnished original etchings are Bracquemond, Lalanne, Rajon,
Legros, and Leopold Flameng, who has given some noble specimens of his skill, especially in the reproduction
of “The Laughing Portrait of Rembrandt,” in his particular province as a reviver of the works
of that artist. The subjects in all cases are chosen for their worth and rarity, and in these respects the
“Portfolio” fairly rivals its great contemporary, one of the noblest fine-art periodicals ever issued, the
Parisian “Gazette des Beaux-Arts.” It has the same finish in execution in the minutest details of
paper and print, and is in every way a <i>thoroughly artistic production</i>, far ahead in this way of anything
of the class heretofore issued in England.</p>

<p class="smaller">There are numerous single illustrations in the “Portfolio,” worth the price of the volume, suitable
for framing.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">
OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.<br>
</p>

<p class="smaller">“Of the <span class="smcap">Portfolio</span> altogether it is to be said, that not only is it <i>the first periodical in the English
language devoted to fine-art, but that it leads all others by a very great distance</i>, whatever
the second and third of such publications may be taken to be.</p>

<p class="smaller">“We warmly commend it to the notice of all who would cultivate in themselves and their families
an appreciation of the beautiful in nature and art. The illustrations are largely of sylvan scenery, and
etchings from the finest paintings are given, with letter-press descriptions, and the best articles from
the highest authorities, so that the monthly paper itself, an illustration of what is taught, becomes a complete
magazine of the science of art. <i>We would regard the introduction of such a journal into the
family as a good educator, while it will prove a source of exquisite pleasure to those who have
already a taste for the beautiful.</i>”—<cite><abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Observer.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“We look for the <span class="smcap">Portfolio</span> as for the only serial published, in which works of art of a certain
kind and of peculiar merit are to be found. Etching is not as popular, perhaps, as it should be, but if
anything is likely to bring its merits before the public, it is such examples as are to be had here. Their
effect is striking, and in execution they are little short of perfect; at any rate they exhibit this kind of
work in the highest degree of perfection to which it has attained.”—<cite><abbr title="New York">N. Y.</abbr> Daily Times.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“Mr. Hamerton’s <span class="smcap">Portfolio</span> is easily chief among English art periodicals, and has the advantage
of being written by men who are not only familiar with the literature of art and the works of artists, but
are artists by profession, and so know the feelings, aims, and technicalities of artists. The editor is
probably better acquainted with continental artists and their work than most of the insular fellows, and
his art theories and criticisms are proportionately more catholic and valuable. The <span class="smcap">Portfolio</span>, instead
of being a magazine of current gossip about artists and their doings, is a work of permanent value, apart
from its excellent illustrations, as a collection of able essays, critical, historical, technical, and personal,
very free from narrowness and professional or national prejudice. It is the glory of the Portfolio
that it is in a way cosmopolitan, free from the prejudices of nations and schools.”—<cite>Atlantic Monthly.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“The Portfolio is very charming. An Art periodical far superior to anything which has hitherto
appeared.”—<cite>Guardian.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“From the first it has stood nearly alone as really ‘an artistic periodical.’ An hour spent over the
Portfolio is one of refreshment, encouragement, and unalloyed delight.”—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“Of the Etchings the merits are unquestionable: indeed, the work is enriched with some of the
finest examples. The literary part is generally worthy of praise for being scholarly, graceful, and
interesting.”—<cite>Athenæum.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“Dealing with artistic subjects generally, and always in a spirit of intelligence and refinement.”—<cite>Graphic.</cite></p>

<p class="smaller">“To the portfolio is unanimously accorded the first place as an artistic periodical.”—<cite>Cambridge
Chronicle.</cite></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
