          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The task of preparing this volume for the press has been a difficult
            and anxious one, and it is necessary to state clearly what has been
            done. The papers given to me by H. P. B. were quite unarranged, and
            had no obvious order: I have, therefore, taken each paper as a
            separate Section, and have arranged them as sequentially as
            possible. With the exception of the correction of grammatical errors
            and the elimination of obviously un-English idioms, the papers are
            as H. P. B. left them, save as otherwise marked. In a few cases I
            have filled in a gap, but any such addition is enclosed within
            square brackets, so as to be distinguished from the text. In
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Mystery of Buddha”</span> a further
            difficulty arose; some of the Sections had been written four or five
            times over, each version containing some sentences that were not in
            the others; I have pieced these versions together, taking the
            fullest as basis, and inserting therein everything added in any
            other versions. It is, however, with some hesitation that I have
            included these Sections in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secret Doctrine</span></span>. Together with some most suggestive thought, they contain very
            numerous errors of fact, and many statements based on exoteric
            writings, not on esoteric knowledge. They were given into my hands
            to publish, as part of the Third Volume of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secret Doctrine</span></span>, and I therefore do not feel justified in coming between the
            author and the public, either by altering the statements, to make
            them consistent with fact, or by suppressing the Sections. She says
            she is acting entirely on her own authority, and it will be
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxx"></a> obvious to any instructed
            reader that she makes—possibly deliberately—many statements so
            confused that they are mere blinds, and other statements—probably
            inadvertently—that are nothing more than the exoteric
            misunderstandings of esoteric truths. The reader must here, as
            everywhere, use his own judgment, but feeling bound to publish these
            Sections, I cannot let them go to the public without a warning that
            much in them is certainly erroneous. Doubtless, had the author
            herself issued this book, she would have entirely re-written the
            whole of this division; as it was, it seemed best to give all she
            had said in the different copies, and to leave it in its rather
            unfinished state, for students will best like to have what she said
            as she said it, even though they may have to study it more closely
            than would have been the case had she remained to finish her work.

            The quotations made have been as far as possible found, and correct
            references given; in this most laborious work a whole band of
            earnest and painstaking students, under the guidance of Mrs.
            Cooper-Oakley, have been my willing assistants. Without their aid it
            would not have been possible to give the references, as often a
            whole book had to be searched through, in order to find a paragraph
            of a few lines.

            This volume completes the papers left by H. P. B., with the
            exception of a few scattered articles that yet remain and that will
            be published in her own magazine
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucifer</span></span>. Her pupils are well aware that few will be found in the present
            generation to do justice to the occult knowledge of H. P. B. and to
            her magnificent sweep of thought, but as she can wait to future
            generations for the justification of her greatness as a teacher, so
            can her pupils afford to wait for the justification of their trust.

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Power belongs to him who knows;”</span>
            this is a very old axiom. Knowledge—the first step to which is the
            power of comprehending the truth, of discerning the real from the
            false—is for those only who, having freed themselves from every
            prejudice and conquered their human conceit and selfishness, are
            ready to accept every and any truth, once it is demonstrated to
            them. Of such there are very few. The majority judge of a work
            according to the respective prejudices of its critics, who are
            guided in their turn by the popularity or unpopularity of the
            author, rather than by its own faults or merits. Outside the
            Theosophical circle, therefore, the present volume is certain to
            receive at the hands of the general public a still colder welcome
            than its two predecessors have met with. In our day no statement can
            hope for a fair trial, or even hearing, unless its arguments run on
            the line of legitimate and accepted enquiry, remaining strictly
            within the boundaries of official Science or orthodox Theology.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Our age is a paradoxical anomaly. It is preëminently materialistic
            and as preëminently pietistic. Our literature, our modern thought
            and progress, so called, both run on these two parallel lines, so
            incongruously dissimilar and yet both so popular and so very
            orthodox, each in its own way. He who presumes to draw a third line,
            as a hyphen of reconciliation between the two, has to be fully
            prepared for the worst. He will have his work mangled by reviewers,
            mocked by the sycophants of Science and Church, misquoted by his
            opponents, and rejected even by the pious lending libraries. The
            absurd misconceptions, in so-called cultured circles of society, of
            the ancient Wisdom-Religion (Bodhism) after the admirably clear and
            scientifically-presented explanations in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>, are a good proof in point. They might have served as a caution
            even to those Theosophists who, hardened in an almost life-long
            struggle in the service of their Cause, are neither timid with their
            pen, nor in the least appalled by dogmatic
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg002"></a> assumption and scientific
            authority. Yet, do what Theosophical writers may, neither
            Materialism nor doctrinal pietism will ever give their Philosophy a
            fair hearing. Their doctrines will be systematically rejected, and
            their theories denied a place even in the ranks of those scientific
            ephemera, the ever-shifting
            <span class="tei tei-q">“working hypotheses”</span> of our day. To
            the advocate of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“animalistic”</span> theory, our
            cosmogenetical and anthropogenetical teachings are
            <span class="tei tei-q">“fairy-tales”</span> at best. For to those
            who would shirk any moral responsibility, it seems certainly more
            convenient to accept descent from a common simian ancestor and see a
            brother in a dumb, tailless baboon, than to acknowledge the
            fatherhood of Pitris, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of God,”</span> and to have to
            recognise as a brother a starveling from the slums.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hold back!”</span> shout in their turn the
            pietists.

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Nor are we, in truth, in any way anxious to attempt the
            metamorphosis. But this cannot, nor shall it, prevent Theosophists
            from saying what they have to say, especially to those who, in
            opposing to our doctrine Modern Science, do so not for her own fair
            sake, but only to ensure the success of their private hobbies and
            personal glorification. If we cannot prove many of our points, no
            more can they; yet we may show how, instead of giving historical and
            scientific facts—for the edification of those who, knowing less than
            they, look to Scientists to do their thinking and form their
            opinions—the efforts of most of our scholars seem solely directed to
            killing ancient facts, or distorting them into props to support
            their own special views. This will be done in no spirit of malice or
            even criticism, as the writer readily admits that most of those she
            finds fault with stand immeasurably higher in learning than herself.
            But great scholarship does not preclude bias and prejudice, nor is
            it a safeguard against self-conceit, but rather the reverse.
            Moreover, it is but in the legitimate defence of our own statements,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the vindication of Ancient Wisdom and its great truths, that we
            mean to take our
            <span class="tei tei-q">“great authorities”</span> to task.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Indeed, unless the precaution of answering beforehand certain
            objections to the fundamental propositions in the present work be
            adopted—objections which are certain to be made on the authority of
            this, that, or another scholar concerning the Esoteric character of
            all the archaic and ancient works on Philosophy—our statements will
            be once more contradicted and even discredited. One of the main
            points in this Volume is to indicate in the works of the old Âryan,
            Greek, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg003"></a> other Philosophers of
            note, as well as in all the world-scriptures, the presence of a
            strong Esoteric allegory and symbolism. Another of the objects is to
            prove that the key of interpretation, as furnished by the Eastern
            Hindu-Buddhistic canon of Occultism—fitting as well the Christian
            Gospels as it does archaic Egyptian, Greek, Chaldæan, Persian, and
            even Hebrew-Mosaic Books—must have been one common to all the
            nations, however divergent may have been their respective methods
            and exoteric <span class="tei tei-q">“blinds.”</span> These claims
            are vehemently denied by some of the foremost scholars of our day.
            In his Edinburgh Lectures, Prof. Max Müller discarded this
            fundamental statement of the Theosophists by pointing to the Hindu
            Shâstras and Pandits, who know nothing of such Esotericism.<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
            The learned Sanskrit scholar stated in so many words that there was
            no hidden meaning, no Esoteric element or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“blinds,”</span> either in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>
            or the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>. Considering that the word

            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Secret Doctrine,”</span> the assertion
            is, to say the least, extraordinary. Sir M. Monier Williams again
            holds the same view with regard to Buddhism. To hear him is to
            regard Gautama, the Buddha, as an enemy of every pretence to
            Esoteric teachings. He himself never taught them! All such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“pretences”</span> to Occult learning and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“magic powers”</span> are due to the later
            Arhats, the subsequent followers of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Light of Asia”</span>! Prof. B. Jowett,
            again, as contemptuously passes the sponge over the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“absurd”</span> interpretations of Plato's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Timæus</span></span>
            and the Mosaic Books by the Neoplatonists. There is not a breath of

            Science, either. Finally, to cap the climax, Prof. Sayce, the
            Assyriologist, although he does not deny the actual presence, in the
            Assyrian tablets and cuneiform literature, of a hidden meaning—

            Thus, in the scholarly appreciation of our modern Orientalists and
            Professors, Science was in its infancy in the days of the Egyptian
            and Chaldæan Astronomers. Pânini, the greatest Grammarian in the
            world, was unacquainted with the art of writing. So was the Lord
            Buddha, and everyone else in India until 300
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
            The grossest ignorance reigned in the days of the Indian Rishis, and
            even in those of Thales, Pythagoras, and Plato. Theosophists must
            indeed be superstitious ignoramuses to speak as they do, in the face
            of such learned evidence to the contrary!
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Truly it looks as if, since the world's creation, there has been but
            one age of real knowledge on earth—the present age. In the misty
            twilight, in the grey dawn of history, stand the pale shadows of the
            old Sages of world renown. They were hopelessly groping for the
            correct meaning of their own Mysteries, the spirit whereof has
            departed without revealing itself to the Hierophants, and has
            remained latent in space until the advent of the initiates of Modern
            Science and Research. The noontide brightness of knowledge has only
            now arrived at the <span class="tei tei-q">“Know-All,”</span> who,
            basking in the dazzling sun of induction, busies himself with his
            Penelopeian task of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“working hypotheses,”</span> and loudly
            asserts his rights to universal knowledge. Can anyone wonder, then,
            that according to present views the learning of the ancient
            Philosopher, and even sometimes that of his direct successors in the
            past centuries, has ever been useless to the world and valueless to
            himself? For, as explained repeatedly in so many words, while the
            Rishis and the Sages of old have walked far over the arid fields of
            myth and superstition, the mediæval Scholar, and even the average
            eighteenth century Scientist, have always been more or less cramped
            by their <span class="tei tei-q">“supernatural”</span> religion and
            beliefs. True, it is generally conceded that some ancient and also
            mediæval Scholars, such as Pythagoras, Plato, Paracelsus, and Roger
            Bacon, followed by a host of glorious names, had indeed left not a
            few landmarks over precious mines of Philosophy and unexplored lodes
            of Physical Science. But then the actual excavation of these, the
            smelting of the gold and silver, and the cutting of the precious
            jewels they contain, are all due to the patient labours of the
            modern man of Science. And is it not to the unparalleled genius of
            the latter that the ignorant and hitherto-deluded world owes a
            correct knowledge of the real nature of the Kosmos, of the true
            origin of the universe and man, as revealed in the automatic and
            mechanical theories of the Physicists, in accordance with strictly
            scientific Philosophy?
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"></a> Before our cultured era,
            Science was but a name, Philosophy a delusion and a snare. According
            to the modest claims of contemporary authority on genuine Science
            and Philosophy, the Tree of Knowledge has only now sprung from the
            dead weeds of superstition, as a beautiful butterfly emerges from an
            ugly grub. We have, therefore, nothing for which to thank our
            forefathers. The Ancients have at best prepared and fertilised the
            soil; it is the Moderns who have planted the seeds of knowledge and
            reared the lovely plants called blank negation and sterile
            agnosticism.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Such, however, is not the view taken by Theosophists. They repeat
            what was stated twenty years ago. It is not sufficient to speak of
            the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“untenable conceptions of an uncultured past”</span>
            (Tyndall); of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">parler enfantin</span></span>”</span>
            of the Vaidic poets (Max Müller); of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“absurdities”</span> of the Neoplatonists
            (Jowett); and of the ignorance of the Chaldæo-Assyrian initiated
            Priests with regard to their own symbols, when compared with the
            knowledge thereon of the British Orientalist (Sayce). Such
            assumptions have to be proven by something more solid than the mere
            word of these scholars. For no amount of boastful arrogance can hide
            the intellectual quarries out of which the representations of so
            many modern Philosophers and Scholars have been carved. How many of
            the most distinguished European Scientists have derived honour and
            credit for the mere dressing-up of the ideas of these old
            Philosophers, whom they are ever ready to disparage, is left to an
            impartial posterity to say. Thus it does seem not altogether untrue
            as stated in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>, to say of certain Orientalists and Scholars of dead languages,
            that they will allow their boundless conceit and
            self-opinionatedness to run away with their logic and reasoning
            powers, rather than concede to the ancient Philosophers the
            knowledge of anything the modern do not know.

            As part of this work treats of the Initiates and the secret
            knowledge imparted during the Mysteries, the statements of those
            who, in spite of the fact that Plato was an Initiate, maintain that
            no hidden Mysticism is to be discovered in his works, have to be
            first examined. Too many of the present scholars, Greek and
            Sanskrit, are but too apt to forego facts in favour of their own
            preconceived theories based on personal prejudice. They conveniently
            forget, at every opportunity, not only the numerous changes in
            language, but also that the allegorical style in the writings of old
            Philosophers and the secretiveness of the Mystics had their
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span>; that both the pre-Christian and the post-Christian
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"></a> classical writers—the
            great majority at all events—were under the sacred obligation never
            to divulge the solemn secrets communicated to them in the
            sanctuaries; and that this alone is sufficient to sadly mislead
            their translators and profane critics. But these critics will admit
            nothing of the kind, as will presently be seen.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            For over twenty-two centuries everyone who has read Plato has been
            aware that, like most of the other Greek Philosophers of note, he
            had been initiated; that therefore, being tied down by the Sodalian
            Oath, he could speak of certain things only in veiled allegories.
            His reverence for the Mysteries is unbounded; he openly confesses
            that he writes <span class="tei tei-q">“enigmatically,”</span> and
            we see him take the greatest precautions to conceal the true meaning
            of his words. Every time the subject touches the greater secrets of
            Oriental Wisdom—the cosmogony of the universe, or the ideal
            preëxisting world—Plato shrouds his Philosophy in the profoundest
            darkness. His
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Timæus</span></span>
            is so confused that no one but an Initiate can understand the hidden

                Neoplatonists ventured to expound, as far as the theurgical vow

                is the Universal Mind diffused through all things, and the dogma
                of the soul's immortality, are the leading features in these
                apparently incongruous teachings. His piety and the great
                veneration he felt for the Mysteries are sufficient warrant that

            before another word is said in defence of Plato and the
            Neoplatonists, the learned master of Balliol College ought to be
            respectfully asked: What does, or can he know of the Esoteric canon
            of interpretation? By the term
            <span class="tei tei-q">“canon”</span>
            is here meant that key which was communicated orally from
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mouth to ear”</span> by the Master to the
            disciple, or by the Hierophant to the candidate for initiation; this
            from time immemorial throughout a long series of ages, during which
            the inner—not public—Mysteries were the most sacred institution of
            every land. Without such a key no correct interpretation of either
            the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dialogues</span></span>

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zend Avesta</span></span>
            to the Mosaic Books, is possible. How then can the Rev. Dr. Jowett

            various sacred books of the nations were
            <span class="tei tei-q">“absurdities?”</span> Where, again, has he
            found an opportunity of studying these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“interpretations”</span>? History shows that
            all such works were destroyed by the Christian Church Fathers and
            their fanatical catechumens, wherever they were found. To say that
            such men as Ammonius, a genius and a saint, whose learning and holy
            life earned for him the title of Theodidaktos (<span class="tei tei-q">“God-taught”</span>), such men as Plotinus, Porphyry, and Proclus, were
            <span class="tei tei-q">“incapable of distinguishing between the opinions of one
              philosopher and another, or between the serious thoughts of Plato
              and his fancies,”</span>
            is to assume an untenable position for a Scholar. It amounts to
            saying that, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) scores of the most famous Philosophers, the greatest Scholars and
            Sages of Greece and of the Roman Empire were dull fools, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that all the other commentators, lovers of Greek Philosophy, some
            of them the acutest intellects of the age—who do not agree with Dr.
            Jowett—are also fools and no better than those whom they admire. The

            an element of Oriental Mysticism, and seeks to show Greek Philosophy

            Among several other equally erroneous propositions, it is especially
            the assumptions (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that Plato was entirely free from any element of Eastern
            Philosophy in his writings, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that every modern scholar, without being a Mystic and a Kabalist
            himself, can pretend to judge of ancient Esotericism—which we mean
            to combat. To do this we have to produce more authoritative
            statements than our own would be, and bring the evidence of other
            scholars as great as Dr. Jowett, if not greater, specialists in
            their subjects, moreover, to bear on and destroy the arguments of
            the Oxford Regius Professor of Greek.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            That Plato was undeniably an ardent admirer and follower of
            Pythagoras no one will deny. And it is equally undeniable, as Matter
            has it, that Plato had inherited on the one hand his doctrines, and
            on the other had drawn his wisdom, from the same sources as the
            Samian Philosopher.<a href="#note_21" id="noteref_21" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>
            And the doctrines of Pythagoras are Oriental to the backbone, and
            even Brâhmanical; for this great Philosopher ever pointed to the far
            East as the source whence he derived his information and his
            Philosophy, and Colebrooke shows that Plato makes the same
            profession in his Epistles, and says that he has taken his teachings
            <span class="tei tei-q">“from ancient and sacred doctrines.”</span><a href="#note_22" id="noteref_22" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a>
            Furthermore, the ideas of both Pythagoras and Plato coincide too
            well with the systems of India and with Zoroastrianism to admit any
            doubt of their origin by anyone who has some acquaintance with these

            Initiates who have acquired powers and transcendental knowledge can
            be traced back to the Fourth Root Race from our own age. As the
            multiplicity of the subjects to be dealt with prohibits the
            introduction of such a historical chapter, which, however historical
            in fact and truth, would be rejected
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à priori</span></span>
            as blasphemy and fable by both Church and Science—we shall only
            touch on the subject. Science strikes out, at its own sweet will and
            fancy, dozens of names of ancient heroes, simply because there is
            too great an element of myth in their histories; the Church insists
            that biblical patriarchs shall be regarded as historical personages,
            and terms her seven <span class="tei tei-q">“Star-angels”</span> the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“historical channels and agents of the Creator.”</span>
            Both are right, since each finds a strong party to side with it.
            Mankind is at best a sorry herd of Panurgian sheep, following
            blindly the leader that happens to suit it at the moment.
            Mankind—the majority at any rate—hates to think for itself. It
            resents as an insult the humblest invitation to step for a moment
            outside the old well-beaten tracks, and, judging for itself, to
            enter into a new path in some fresh direction. Give it an unfamiliar
            problem to solve, and if its mathematicians, not liking its looks,
            refuse to deal with it, the crowd, unfamiliar with mathematics, will
            stare at the unknown quantity, and getting hopelessly entangled in
            sundry
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">x</span></span>'s and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">y</span></span>'s, will turn round, trying to rend to pieces the uninvited
            disturber of its intellectual Nirvâna. This may, perhaps, account
            for the ease and extraordinary success enjoyed by the Roman Church
            in her conversions of nominal Protestants and Free-thinkers, whose
            name is legion, but who have never gone to the trouble of thinking
            for themselves on these most important and tremendous problems of
            man's inner nature.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And yet, if the evidence of facts, the records preserved in History,
            and the uninterrupted anathemas of the Church against
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Magic”</span> and Magicians of the
            accursed race of Cain, are not to be heeded, our efforts will prove
            very puny indeed. When, for nearly two millenniums,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a> a body of men has never
            ceased to lift its voice against
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Black</span></em>
            Magic, the inference ought to be irrefutable that if Black Magic
            exists as a real fact, there must be somewhere its counterpart—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">White</span></em>
            Magic. False silver coins could have no existence if there were no
            genuine silver money. Nature is dual in whatever she attempts, and
            this ecclesiastical persecution ought alone to have opened the eyes
            of the public long ago. However much travellers may be ready to
            pervert every fact with regard to abnormal powers with which certain
            men are gifted in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“heathen”</span> countries; however eager
            they may be to put false constructions on such facts, and—to use an
            old proverb—<span class="tei tei-q">“to call white swan black goose,”</span>
            and to kill it, yet the evidence of even Roman Catholic missionaries
            ought to be taken into consideration, once they swear in a body to
            certain facts. Nor is it because they choose to see Satanic agency
            in manifestations of a certain kind, that their evidence as to the
            existence of such powers can be disregarded. For what do they say of
            China? Those missionaries who have lived in the country for long
            years, and have seriously studied every fact and belief that may
            prove an obstacle to their success in making conversions, and who
            have become familiar with every exoteric rite of both the official
            religion and sectarian creeds—all swear to the existence of a
            certain body of men, whom no one can reach but the Emperor and a
            select body of high officials. A few years ago, before the war in
            Tonkin, the archbishop in Pekin, on the report of some hundreds of
            missionaries and Christians, wrote to Rome the identical story that
            had been reported twenty-five years before, and had been widely
            circulated in clerical papers. They had fathomed, it was said, the
            mystery of certain official deputations, sent at times of danger by
            the Emperor and ruling powers to their Sheu and Kiuay, as they are
            called among the people. These Sheu and Kiuay, they explained, were
            the Genii of the mountains, endowed with the most miraculous powers.
            They are regarded as the protectors of China, by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ignorant”</span> masses; as the incarnation
            of Satanic power by the good and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“learned”</span> missionaries.

            Nevertheless, this must be attempted. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>, all that could be stated about Magic was set down in the guise of
            hints; and thus, owing to the great amount of material scattered
            over two large volumes, much of its importance was lost upon the
            reader, while it still more failed to draw his attention on account
            of the faulty arrangement. But hints may now grow into explanations.
            One can never repeat it too often—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Magic is as old as man</span></em>. It cannot any longer be called charlatanry or hallucination, when
            its lesser branches—such as mesmerism, now miscalled
            <span class="tei tei-q">“hypnotism,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“thought reading,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“action by suggestion,”</span> and what not
            else, only to avoid calling it by its right and legitimate name—are
            being so seriously investigated by the most famous Biologists and
            Physiologists of both Europe and America. Magic is indissolubly
            blended with the Religion of every country and is
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg020"></a> inseparable from its
            origin. It is as impossible for History to name the time when it was
            not, as that of the epoch when it sprang into existence, unless the
            doctrines preserved by the Initiates are taken into consideration.
            Nor can Science ever solve the problem of the origin of man if it
            rejects the evidence of the oldest records in the world, and refuses
            from the hand of the legitimate Guardians of the mysteries of Nature
            the key to Universal Symbology. Whenever a writer has tried to
            connect the first foundation of Magic with a particular country or
            some historical event or character, further research has shown his
            hypothesis to be groundless. There is a most lamentable
            contradiction among the Symbologists on this point. Some would have
            it that Odin, the Scandinavian priest and monarch, originated the
            practice of Magic some 70 years
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, although it is spoken of repeatedly in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>. But as it was proven that the mysterious rites of the priestesses
            Valas (Voilers) were greatly anterior to Odin's age<a href="#note_33" id="noteref_33" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a>, then Zoroaster came in for an attempt, on the ground that he was
            the founder of Magian rites; but Ammianus Marcellinus, Pliny and
            Arnobius, with other ancient Historians, have shown that Zoroaster
            was but a reformer of Magic as practised by the Chaldæans and
            Egyptians, and not at all its founder.<a href="#note_34" id="noteref_34" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>

            authority of some men of Science, calls Magic charlatantry. But
            there are eight hundred millions on the face of the globe who
            believe in it to this day; there are said to be twenty millions of
            perfectly sane and often very intellectual men and women, members of
            that same society, who believe in its phenomena under the name of
            Spiritualism. The whole ancient world, with its Scholars and
            Philosophers, its Sages and Prophets, believed in it. Where is the
            country in which it was not practised? At what age was it banished,
            even from our own country? In the New World as in the Old Country
            (the latter far younger than the former), the Science of Sciences
            was known and practised from the remotest antiquity. The Mexicans
            had their Initiates, their Priest-Hierophants and Magicians, and
            their crypts of Initiation. Of the two statues exhumed in the
            Pacific States, one represents a Mexican Adept, in the posture
            prescribed for the Hindu ascetic, and the other an Aztec Priestess,
            in a head-gear which might be taken from the head of an Indian
            Goddess; while the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Guatemalan Medal”</span> exhibits the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Tree of Knowledge”</span>—with its hundreds
            of eyes and ears, symbolical of seeing and hearing—encircled by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Serpent of Wisdom”</span> whispering into
            the ear of the sacred bird. Bernard Diaz de Castilla, a follower of
            Cortez, gives some idea of the extraordinary refinement,
            intelligence and civilization, and also of the magic arts of the
            people whom the Spaniards conquered by brute force. Their pyramids
            are those of Egypt, built according to the same secret canon of
            proportion as those of the Pharaohs, and the Aztecs appear to have
            derived their civilization and religion in more than one way from
            the same source as the Egyptians and, before these, the Indians.
            Among all these three peoples arcane Natural Philosophy, or Magic,
            was cultivated to the highest degree.

            Truths that rest on Occult mysteries will have, for one reader who
            may appreciate them, a thousand who will brand them as impostures.
            This is only natural, and the only means to avoid it would be for an
            Occultist to pledge himself to the Pythagorean
            <span class="tei tei-q">“vow of silence,”</span> and renew it every
            five years. Otherwise, cultured society—two-thirds of which think
            themselves in duty bound to believe that, since the first appearance
            of the first Adept, one half of mankind practised deception and
            fraud on the other half—cultured society will undeniably assert its
            hereditary and traditional right to stone the intruder. Those
            benevolent critics, who most readily promulgate the now famous axiom

            human race is simply composed of knaves and congenital idiots. But
            this matters very little. The vindication of the Occultists and
            their Archaic Science is working itself slowly but steadily into the
            very heart of society, hourly, daily, and yearly, in the shape of
            two monster branches, two stray off-shoots of the trunk of
            Magic—Spiritualism and the Roman Church. Fact works its way very
            often through fiction. Like an immense boa-constrictor, Error, in
            every shape, encircles mankind, trying to smother in her deadly
            coils every aspiration towards truth and light. But Error is
            powerful only on the surface, prevented as she is by Occult Nature
            from going any deeper; for the same Occult Nature encircles the
            whole globe, in every direction, leaving not even the darkest corner
            unvisited. And, whether by phenomenon or miracle, by spirit-hook or
            bishop's crook, Occultism must win the day, before the present era
            reaches
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Shani's (Saturn's) triple septenary”</span>

            flourishes still on earth, and its votaries are many, albeit

            But there exists in the world another class of adepts, belonging to
            a brotherhood also, and mightier than any other of those known to
            the profane. Many among these are personally good and benevolent,
            even pure and holy occasionally, as individuals. Pursuing
            collectively, however, and as a body, a selfish, one-sided object,
            with relentless vigour and determination, they have to be ranked
            with the adepts <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg025"></a> of the Black Art. These
            are our modern Roman Catholic
            <span class="tei tei-q">“fathers”</span> and clergy. Most of the
            hieratic writings and symbols have been deciphered by them since the
            Middle Ages. A hundred times more learned in secret Symbology and
            the old Religions than our Orientalists will ever be, the
            personification of astuteness and cleverness, every such adept in
            the art holds the keys tightly in his firmly clenched hand, and will
            take care the secret shall not be easily divulged, if he can help
            it. There are more profoundly learned Kabalists in Rome and
            throughout Europe and America, than is generally suspected. Thus are
            the professedly public
            <span class="tei tei-q">“brotherhoods”</span> of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“black”</span> adepts more powerful and
            dangerous for Protestant countries than any host of Eastern
            Occultists. People laugh at Magic! Men of Science, Physiologists and
            Biologists, deride the potency and even the belief in the existence
            of what is called in vulgar parlance
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sorcery”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Magic”</span>! The Archæologists have
            their Stonehenge in England with its thousands of secrets, and its
            twin-brother Karnac of Brittany, and yet there is not one of them
            who even suspects what has been going on in its crypts, and its
            mysterious nooks and corners, for the last century. More than that,
            they do not even know of the existence of such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“magic halls”</span> in their Stonehenge,
            where curious scenes are taking place, whenever there is a new
            convert in view. Hundreds of experiments have been, and are being
            made daily at the Salpêtrière, and also by learned hypnotisers at
            their private houses. It is now proved that certain sensitives—both
            men and women—when commanded in trance, by the practitioner, who
            operates on them, to do a certain thing—from drinking a glass of
            water up to simulated murder—on recovering their normal state lose
            all remembrance of the order inspired—<span class="tei tei-q">“suggested”</span>
            it is now called by Science. Nevertheless, at the appointed hour and
            moment, the subject, though conscious and perfectly awake, is
            compelled by an irresistible power within himself to do that action
            which has been suggested to him by his mesmeriser; and that too,
            whatever it may be, and whatever the period fixed by him who
            controls the subject, that is to say, holds the latter under the
            power of his will, as a snake holds a bird under its fascination,
            and finally forces it to jump into its open jaws. Worse than this:
            for the bird is conscious of the peril; it resists, however helpless
            in its final efforts, while the hypnotized subject does not rebel,
            but seems to follow the suggestions and voice of his own free-will
            and soul. Who of our European men of Science, who believe in such
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scientific</span></em>
            experiments—and very
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg026"></a> few are they who still
            doubt them now-a-days, and who do not feel convinced of their actual
            reality—who of them, it is asked, is ready to admit this as being
            Black Magic? Yet it is the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuine</span></em>, undeniable and actual
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fascination</span></em>
            and
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sorcery</span></em>
            of old. The Mulu Kurumbas of Nîlgiri do not proceed otherwise in
            their
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">envoûtements</span></span>
            when they seek to destroy an enemy, nor do the Dugpas of Sikkim and
            Bhûtân know of any more potential agent than their
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>. Only in them that will does not proceed by jumps and starts, but
            acts with certainty; it does not depend on the amount of receptivity
            or nervous impressibility of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“subject.”</span> Having chosen his victim
            and placed himself
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">en rapport</span></span>
            with him, the Dugpa's <span class="tei tei-q">“fluid”</span> is sure
            to find its way, for his will is immeasurably more strongly
            developed than the will of the European experimenter—the self-made,
            untutored, and
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unconscious</span></em>
            Sorcerer for the sake of Science—who has no idea (or belief either)
            of the variety and potency of the world-old methods used to develop
            this power, by the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious</span></em>
            sorcerer, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Magician”</span> of the
            East and West.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And now the question is openly and squarely asked: Why should not
            the fanatical and zealous priest, thirsting to convert some selected
            rich and influential member of society, use the same means to
            accomplish his end as the French Physician and experimenter uses in
            his case with his subject? The conscience of the Roman Catholic
            priest is most likely at peace. He works
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personally</span></em>
            for no selfish purpose, but with the object of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“saving a soul”</span> from
            <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal damnation.”</span> In his view, if
            Magic there be in it, it is holy, meritorious and divine Magic. Such
            is the power of blind faith.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Hence, when we are assured by trustworthy and respectable persons of
            high social standing, and unimpeachable character, that there are
            many well-organised societies among the Roman Catholic priests
            which, under the pretext and cover of Modern Spiritualism and
            mediumship, hold
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">séances</span></span>
            for the purposes of conversion by suggestion, directly and at a
            distance—we answer: We know it. And when, moreover, we are told that
            whenever those priest-hypnotists are desirous of acquiring an
            influence over some individual or individuals, selected by them for
            conversion, they retire to an underground place, allotted and
            consecrated by them for such purposes (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, ceremonial Magic); and there, forming a circle, throw their
            combined will-power in the direction of that individual, and thus by
            repeating the process, gain a complete control over their victim—we
            again <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg027"></a> answer: Very likely. In
            fact we know the practice to be so, whether this kind of ceremonial
            Magic and
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">envoûtement</span></span>
            is practised at Stonehenge or elsewhere. We know it, we say, through
            personal experience; and also because several of the writer's best
            and most loved friends have been unconsciously drawn into the Romish
            Church and under her
            <span class="tei tei-q">“benign”</span> protection by such means.
            And, therefore, we can only laugh in pity at the ignorance and
            stubbornness of those deluded men of Science and cultured
            experimentalists who, while believing in the power of Dr. Charcot
            and his disciples to <span class="tei tei-q">“envoûte”</span> their
            subjects, find nothing better than a scornful smile whenever Black
            Magic and its potency are mentioned before them. Éliphas Lévi, the
            Abbé-Kabalist, died before Science and the Faculté de Médecine of
            France had accepted hypnotism and influence
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par suggestion</span></span>
            among its scientific experiments, but this is what he said
            twenty-five years ago, in his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie</span></span>, on

                which they desired to obtain possession of for evil purposes....

              <span style="font-size: 90%">what we thought of magic spells, and how this power was
                exceedingly real and dangerous. The true Magus throws a spell

              <span style="font-size: 90%">he casts a spell, even by his pardon, over those who do him
                injury, and the enemies of Initiates never long enjoy impunity

                fatal law in numerous instances. The executioners of martyrs
                always perish miserably; and the Adepts are the martyrs of
                intelligence. Providence [Karma] seems to despise those who
                despise them, and puts to death those who would seek to prevent
                them from living. The legend of the Wandering Jew is the popular
                poetry of this arcanum. A people had sent a sage to crucifixion;

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fables,”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition,”</span> will be the answer.
            Be it so. Before the lethal breath of selfishness and indifference
            every uncomfortable fact is transformed into meaningless fiction,
            and every branch of the once verdant Tree of Truth has become dried
            up and stripped of its primeval spiritual significance. Our modern
            Symbologist is superlatively clever only at detecting phallic
            worship and sexual emblems even where none were ever meant. But for
            the true student of Occult Lore, White or Divine Magic could no more
            exist in Nature without its counterpart Black Magic, than day
            without night, whether these be of twelve hours or of six months'
            duration. For him everything in that Nature has an occult—a bright
            and a night side to it. Pyramids and Druid's oaks, dolmens and
            Bo-trees, plant and mineral—everything was full of deep significance
            and of sacred truths of wisdom, when the Arch-Druid performed his
            magic cures and incantations, and the Egyptian Hierophant evoked and
            guided Chemnu, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“lovely spectre,”</span> the female
            Frankenstein-creation of old, raised for the torture and test of the
            soul-power of the candidate for initiation, simultaneously with the
            last agonising cry of his terrestrial human nature. True, Magic has
            lost its name, and along with it its rights to recognition. But its
            practice is in daily use; and its progeny,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“magnetic influence,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“power of oratory,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“irresistible fascination,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“whole audiences subdued and held as though under a spell,”</span>
            are terms recognised and used by all, generally meaningless though
            they now are. Its effects, however, are more determined and definite
            among religious congregations such as the Shakers, the Negro
            Methodists, and Salvationists, who call it
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the action of the Holy Spirit”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“grace.”</span> The real truth is that Magic
            is still in full sway amidst mankind, however blind the latter to
            its silent presence and influence on its members, however ignorant
            society may be, and remain, to its daily and hourly beneficent and
            maleficent effects. The world is full of such unconscious
            magicians—in politics as well as in daily life, in the Church as in
            the strongholds of Free-Thought. Most of those magicians are
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sorcerers”</span> unhappily, not
            metaphorically but in sober reality, by reason of their inherent
            selfishness, their revengeful natures, their envy and malice. The
            true student of Magic, well aware of the truth, looks on in pity,
            and, if he be wise, keeps silent. For every effort made by him to
            remove the universal cecity is only repaid with ingratitude,
            slander, and often curses, which, unable to reach him, will react on
            those who wish him evil. Lies and calumny—the latter a teething lie,
            adding actual bites to empty harmless
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"></a> falsehoods—become his
            lot, and thus the well-wisher is soon torn to pieces, as a reward
            for his benevolent desire to enlighten.

            Enough has been given, it is believed, to shew that the existence of
            a Secret Universal Doctrine, besides its practical methods of Magic,
            is no wild romance or fiction. The fact was known to the whole
            ancient world, and the knowledge of it has survived in the East, in
            India especially. And if there be such a Science, there must be
            naturally, somewhere, professors of it, or Adepts. In any case it
            matters little whether the Guardians of the Sacred Lore are regarded
            as living, actually existing men, or are viewed as myths. It is
            their Philosophy that will have to stand or fall upon its own
            merits, apart from, and independent of any Adepts. For in the words
            of the wise Gamaliel, addressed by him to the Synedrion:

            The Secret Doctrine of the Âryan East is found repeated under
            Egyptian symbolism and phraseology in the Books of Hermes. At, or
            near, the beginning of the present century, all the books called
            Hermetic were, in the opinion of the average man of Science,
            unworthy of serious attention. They were set down and loudly
            proclaimed as simply a collection of tales, of fraudulent pretences
            and most absurd claims. They
            <span class="tei tei-q">“never existed before the Christian era,”</span>
            it was said:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“they were all written with the triple object of speculation,
              deceiving and pious fraud;”</span>
            they were all, even the best of them, silly apocrypha.<a href="#note_45" id="noteref_45" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a>
            In this respect the nineteenth century proved a most worthy scion of
            the eighteenth, for, in the age of Voltaire as well as in this
            century, everything, save what emanated direct from the Royal
            Academy, was false, superstitious, foolish. Belief in the wisdom of
            the Ancients was laughed to scorn, perhaps more so even than it is
            now. The very thought of accepting as authentic the works and
            vagaries of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a false Hermes, a false Orpheus, a false Zoroaster,”</span>
            of false Oracles, false Sibyls, and a thrice false Mesmer and his
            absurd fluid, was tabooed all along the line. Thus all that had its
            genesis outside the learned and dogmatic precincts of Oxford and
            Cambridge,<a href="#note_46" id="noteref_46" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a>
            or the Academy of France, was
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg031"></a> denounced in those days
            as <span class="tei tei-q">“unscientific,”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ridiculously absurd.”</span> This tendency
            has survived to the present day.

            Nothing can be further from the intention of any true Occultist—who
            stands possessed, by virtue of his higher psychic development, of
            instruments of research far more penetrating in their power than any
            as yet in the hands of physical experimentalists—than to look
            unsympathetically on the efforts that are being made in the area of
            physical enquiry. The exertions and labours undertaken to solve as
            many as possible of the problems of Nature have always been holy in
            his sight. The spirit in which Sir Isaac Newton remarked that at the
            end of all his astronomical work he felt a mere child picking up
            shells beside the Ocean of Knowledge, is one of reverence for the
            boundlessness of Nature which Occult Philosophy itself cannot
            eclipse. And it may freely be recognised that the attitude of mind
            which this famous simile describes is one which fairly represents
            that of the great majority of
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuine</span></em>
            Scientists in regard to all the phenomena of the physical plane of
            Nature. In dealing with this they are often caution and moderation
            itself. They observe facts with a patience that cannot be surpassed.
            They are slow to cast these into theories, with a prudence that
            cannot be too highly commended. And, subject to the limitations
            under which they observe Nature, they are beautifully accurate in
            the record of their observations. Moreover, it may be conceded
            further that modern Scientists are exceedingly careful not to affirm
            negations. They may say it is immensely improbable that any
            discovery will ever conflict with such or such a theory, now
            supported by such and such an aggregation of recorded facts. But
            even in reference to the broadest generalizations—which pass into a
            dogmatic form only in brief popular text books of scientific
            knowledge—the tone of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Science”</span> itself, if that abstraction
            may be held to be embodied in the persons of its most distinguished
            representatives, is one of reserve and often of modesty.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Far, therefore, from being disposed to scoff at the errors into
            which the limitations of their methods may betray men of Science,
            the true Occultist will rather appreciate the pathos of a situation
            in which great industry and thirst for truth are condemned to
            disappointment, and often to confusion.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            That which is to be deplored, however, in respect to Modern Science,
            is in itself an evil manifestation of the excessive caution which in
            its most favourable aspect protects Science from over-hasty
            conclusions: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg032"></a> namely, the tardiness of
            Scientists to recognise that other instruments of research may be
            applicable to the mysteries of Nature besides those of the physical
            plane, and that it may consequently be impossible to appreciate the
            phenomena of any one plane correctly without observing them as well
            from the points of view afforded by others. In so far then as they
            wilfully shut their eyes to evidence which ought to have shown them
            clearly that Nature is more complex than physical phenomena alone
            would suggest, that there are means by which the faculties of human
            perception can pass sometimes from one plane to the other, and that
            their energy is being misdirected while they turn it exclusively on
            the minutiæ of physical structure or force, they are less entitled
            to sympathy than to blame.

            the Latin term
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">fabula</span></span>, a fable, synonymous with something told, as having happened in
            pre-historic times, and not necessarily an invention. With such

            of historical, geographical, ethnological and philological surprises
            in store for the century to come. Travesties in Philosophy have
            become so common of late, that the public can be startled by nothing
            in this direction. It has already been stated by one learned
            speculator that Homer was simply
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a mythical personification of the épopée”</span><a href="#note_50" id="noteref_50" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>; by another, that Hippocrates, son of Esculapius
            <span class="tei tei-q">“could only be a chimera”</span>; that the
            Asclepiades, their seven hundred years of duration notwithstanding,
            might after all prove simply a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“fiction”</span>; that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the city of Troy (Dr. Schliemann to the contrary) existed only
              on the maps,”</span>
            etc. Why should not the world be invited after this to regard every
            hitherto historical character of days of old as a myth? Were not
            Alexander the Great needed by Philology as a sledge-hammer wherewith
            to break the heads of Brâhmanical chronological pretensions, he
            would have become long ago simply
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a symbol for annexation,”</span> or

            Blank denial is the only refuge left to the critics. It is the most
            secure asylum for some time to come in which to shelter the last of
            the sceptics. For one who denies unconditionally, the trouble of
            arguing is unnecessary, and he also thus avoids what is worse,
            having to yield occasionally a point or two before the irrefutable

            appearing in our day in print, it is easy to see that the day for
            concealment and travesty has passed away. Science, in Philology,
            Symbolism and Comparative Religion, has progressed too far to make
            wholesale denials any longer, and the Church is too wise and
            cautious not to be now making the best of the situation. Meanwhile,
            the

            daily exhumed on the sites of Babylonia, can no longer be used as
            clear evidence of a Satan-worship, since the same symbols are shown
            in the ritual of the Latin Church. The latter is too learned to be
            ignorant of the fact that even the later Chaldæans, who had
            gradually fallen into dualism, reducing all things to two primal
            Principles, never worshipped Satan or idols, any more than did the
            Zoroastrians, who now lie under the same accusation, but that their
            Religion was as highly philosophical as any; their dual and exoteric
            Theosophy became the heirloom of the Jews, who, in their turn, were

            Things of late have changed, true enough. The field of investigation
            has widened; old religions are a little better understood; and since
            that miserable day when the Committee of the French Academy, headed
            by Benjamin Franklin, investigated Mesmer's phenomena only to
            proclaim them charlatanry and clever knavery, both heathen
            Philosophy and Mesmerism have acquired certain rights and
            privileges, and are now viewed from quite a different standpoint. Is
            full justice rendered them, however, and are they any better
            appreciated? We are afraid not. Human nature is the same now, as

            Thus in the first decades of our century Hermetic Philosophy was
            regarded by both Churchmen and men of Science from two quite
            opposite points of view. The former called it sinful and devilish;
            the latter denied point-blank its authenticity, notwithstanding the
            evidence brought forward by the most erudite men of every age,
            including our own. The learned Father Kircher, for instance, was not
            even noticed; and his assertion that all the fragments known under
            titles of works by Mercury Trismegistus, Berosus, Pherecydes of
            Syros, etc., were rolls that had escaped the fire which devoured
            100,000 volumes of the great Alexandrian Library—was simply laughed
            at. Nevertheless the educated classes of Europe knew then, as they
            do now, that the famous Alexandrian Library, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“marvel of the ages,”</span> was founded by
            Ptolemy Philadelphus; that numbers of its MSS. had been carefully
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a> copied from hieratic
            texts and the oldest parchments, Chaldæan, Phœnician, Persian, etc.;
            and that these transliterations and copies amounted, in their turn,
            to another 100,000 rolls, as Josephus and Strabo assert.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            There is also the additional evidence of Clemens Alexandrinus, that
            ought to be credited to some extent.<a href="#note_58" id="noteref_58" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>
            Clemens testified to the existence of an additional 30,000 volumes
            of the Books of Thoth, placed in the library of the Tomb of
            Osymandias, over the entrance of which were inscribed the words,

            The merit of Champollion as an Egyptologist none will question, and
            if he declare that everything demonstrates the accuracy of the
            writings of the mysterious Hermes Trismegistus, and if the assertion
            that their antiquity runs back into the night of time be
            corroborated by him in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg038"></a> minutest details, then
            indeed criticism ought to be fully satisfied. Says Champollion:

            Since these words were written, some of the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“mythical”</span> Orpheus have also been
            found copied word for word, in hieroglyphics, in certain
            inscriptions of the Fourth Dynasty, addressed to various Deities.
            Finally, Creuzer discovered and immediately pointed out the very
            significant fact that numerous passages found in Homer and Hesiod
            were undeniably borrowed by the two great poets from the Orphic
            Hymns, thus proving the latter to be far older than the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span>
            or the

            And so gradually the ancient claims come to be vindicated, and
            modern criticism has to submit to evidence. Many are now the writers
            who confess that such a type of literature as the Hermetic works of
            Egypt can never be dated too far back into the prehistoric ages. The
            texts of many of these ancient works, that of Enoch included, so
            loudly proclaimed <span class="tei tei-q">“apocryphal”</span> at the

            the bulk of our Materialists. The reason for this is very simple and
            evident. All these texts—held in universal veneration in Antiquity,
            found in the secret libraries of all the great temples, studied (if
            not always mastered) by the greatest statesmen, classical writers,
            philosophers, kings and laymen, as much as by renowned Sages—what
            were they? Treatises on Magic and Occultism, pure and simple; the
            now derided and tabooed Theosophy—hence the ostracism.

            Every Art and Science, however, whatever its intrinsic merit, has

            known of them, whether in history or legend? Clemens Alexandrinus,

            And so he shows Cleanthes taught by Zeno, Theophrastus by Aristotle,
            Metrodorus by Epicurus, Plato by Socrates, etc. And he adds that
            when he had looked further back to Pythagoras, Pherecydes, and
            Thales, he had still to search for their masters. The same for the
            Egyptians, the Indians, the Babylonians, and the Magi themselves. He
            would not cease questioning, he says, to learn who it was they all
            had for their masters. And when he (Clemens) had traced down the
            enquiry to the very cradle of mankind, to the first generation of
            men, he would reiterate once more his questioning, and ask,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who is their teacher?”</span> Surely, he
            argues, their master could be
            <span class="tei tei-q">“no one of men.”</span> And even when we
            should have reached as high as the Angels, the same query would have
            to be offered to them:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who were their (meaning the

            The aim of the good father's long argument is of course to discover
            two distinct masters, one the preceptor of biblical patriarchs, the
            other the teacher of the Gentiles. But the students of the Secret
            Doctrine need go to no such trouble. Their professors are well aware
            who were the Masters of their predecessors in Occult Sciences and
            Wisdom.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The two professors are finally traced out by Clemens, and are, as
            was to be expected, God, and his eternal and everlasting enemy and
            opponent, the Devil; the subject of Clemens' enquiry relating to the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dual</span></em>
            aspect of Hermetic Philosophy, as cause and effect. Admitting the
            moral beauty of the virtues preached in every Occult work with which
            he was acquainted, Clemens desires to know the cause of the apparent
            contradiction between the doctrine and the practice, good and evil
            Magic, and he comes to the conclusion that Magic has two
            origins—divine and diabolical. He perceives its bifurcation into two
            channels, hence his deduction and inference.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            We perceive it too, without, however, necessarily designating such
            bifurcation diabolical, for we judge the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“left-hand path”</span> as it
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg040"></a>
            issued from the hands of its founder. Otherwise, judging also by the
            effects of Clemens' own religion and the walk in life of certain of
            its professors, since the death of their Master, the Occultists
            would have a right to come to somewhat the same conclusion as
            Clemens. They would have a right to say that while Christ, the
            Master of all
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>
            Christians, was in every way godly, those who resorted to the
            horrors of the Inquisition, to the extermination and torture of
            heretics, Jews and Alchemists, the Protestant Calvin who burnt
            Servetus, and his persecuting Protestant successors, down to the
            whippers and burners of witches in America, must have had for
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em>
            Master, the Devil. But Occultists, not believing in the Devil, are
            precluded from retaliating in this way.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Clemens' testimony, however, is valuable in so far as it shows (1)
            the enormous number of works on Occult Sciences in his day; and (2)
            the extraordinary powers acquired through those Sciences by certain

            through his Occult powers a marvellous rain; it is Aristæus causing

            There have been in all ages use and abuse of Magic, as there are use
            and abuse of Mesmerism or Hypnotism in our own. The ancient world
            had its Apollonii and its Pherecydæ, and intellectual people could
            discriminate then, as they can now. While no classical or pagan
            writer has ever found one word of blame for Apollonius of Tyana, for
            instance, it is not so with regard to Pherecydes. Hesychius of
            Miletia, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"></a> Philo of Byblos and
            Eusthathius charge the latter unstintingly with having built his
            Philosophy and Science on demoniacal traditions—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, on Sorcery. Cicero declares that Pherecydes is,
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">potius divinus quam medicus</span></span>,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“rather a soothsayer than a physician,”</span>
            and Diogenes Laërtius gives a vast number of stories relating to his
            predictions. One day Pherecydes prophesies the shipwreck of a vessel
            hundreds of miles away from him; another time he predicts the
            capture of the Lacedæmonians by the Arcadians; finally, he foresees
            his own wretched end.<a href="#note_64" id="noteref_64" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The false rendering of a number of parables and sayings of Jesus is
            not to be wondered at in the least. From Orpheus, the first
            initiated Adept of whom history catches a glimpse in the mists of
            the pre-Christian era, down through Pythagoras, Confucius, Buddha,
            Jesus, Apollonius of Tyana, to Ammonius Saccas, no Teacher or
            Initiate has ever committed anything to writing for public use. Each
            and all of them have invariably recommended silence and secresy on
            certain facts and deeds; from Confucius, who refused to explain
            publicly and satisfactorily what he meant by his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Extreme,”</span> or to give the key
            to the divination by <span class="tei tei-q">“straws,”</span> down
            to Jesus, who charged his disciples to tell no man that he was
            Christ<a href="#note_73" id="noteref_73" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>

            trials, before his supreme and last Initiation, or that he had
            produced a <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle”</span> of

            The Apostles had to preserve silence, so that the left hand should
            not know what the right hand did; in plainer words, that the
            dangerous proficients in the Left Hand Science—the terrible enemies
            of the Right Hand Adepts, especially before their supreme
            Initiation—should not profit by the publicity so as to harm both the
            healer and the patient. And if the above is maintained to be simply
            an assumption, then what may be the meaning of these awful words:

            The work of propagating such truths in parables was left to the
            disciples of the high Initiates. It was their duty to follow the
            key-note of the Secret Teaching without revealing its mysteries.
            This is shown in the histories of all the great Adepts. Pythagoras
            divided his classes into hearers of exoteric and esoteric lectures.
            The Magians received their instructions and were initiated in the
            far hidden caves of Bactria. When Josephus declares that Abraham
            taught Mathematics he meant by it
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Magic,”</span> for in the Pythagorean code
            Mathematics mean Esoteric Science, or Gnosis.

            Nothing whatever most certainly, if those mysteries had been given
            from the first. And so it was with regard to the first, semi-divine,
            pure and spiritual Races of Humanity. They had the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“truths of God,”</span> and lived up to
            them, and their ideals. They preserved them, so long as there was
            hardly any evil, and hence scarcely a possible abuse of that
            knowledge and those truths. But evolution and the gradual fall into
            materiality is also one of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“truths”</span> and also one of the laws of

            became with every generation more of the earth, earthly, the

            knowledge and power. And selfishness is a human building, whose
            windows and doors are ever wide open for every kind of iniquity to
            enter into man's soul. Few were the men during the early adolescence
            of mankind, and fewer still are they now, who feel disposed to put
            into practice Pope's forcible declaration that he would tear out his
            own heart, if it had no better disposition than to love only
            himself, and laugh at all his neighbours. Hence the necessity of
            gradually taking away from man the divine knowledge and power, which
            became with every new human cycle more dangerous as a double-edged
            weapon, whose evil side was ever threatening one's neighbour, and
            whose power for good was lavished freely only upon self. Those few
            <span class="tei tei-q">“elect”</span> whose inner natures had
            remained unaffected by their outward physical growth, thus became in
            time the sole guardians of the mysteries revealed, passing the
            knowledge to those most fit to receive it, and keeping it
            inaccessible to others. Reject this explanation from the Secret
            Teachings, and the very name of Religion will become synonymous with
            deception and fraud.

            Yet the masses could not be allowed to remain without some sort of
            moral restraint. Man is ever craving for a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“beyond”</span> and cannot live without an
            ideal of some kind, as a beacon and a consolation. At the same time,
            no average man, even in our age of universal education, could be
            entrusted with truths too metaphysical, too subtle for his mind to
            comprehend, without the danger of an imminent reaction setting in,
            and faith in Gods and Saints making room for an unscientific blank
            Atheism. No real philanthropist, hence no Occultist, would
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg051"></a> dream for a moment of a
            mankind without one tittle of Religion. Even the modern day Religion
            in Europe, confined to Sundays, is better than none. But if, as
            Bunyan put it,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Religion is the best armour that a man can have,”</span>
            it certainly is the <span class="tei tei-q">“worst cloak”</span>;
            and it is that <span class="tei tei-q">“cloak”</span> and false
            pretence which the Occultists and the Theosophists fight against.
            The true ideal Deity, the one living God in Nature, can never suffer
            in man's worship if that outward cloak, woven by man's fancy, and
            thrown upon the Deity by the crafty hand of the priest greedy of
            power and domination, is drawn aside. The hour has struck with the
            commencement of this century to dethrone the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“highest God”</span> of every nation in
            favour of One Universal Deity—the God of Immutable Law, not charity;
            the God of Just Retribution, not mercy, which is merely an incentive
            to evil-doing and to a repetition of it. The greatest crime that was
            ever perpetrated upon mankind was committed on that day when the
            first priest invented the first prayer with a selfish object in
            view. A God who may be propitiated by iniquitous prayers to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“bless the arms”</span> of the worshipper,
            and send defeat and death to thousands of his enemies—his brethren;
            a Deity that can be supposed not to turn a deaf ear to chants of
            laudation mixed with entreaties for a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“fair propitious wind”</span> for self, and
            as naturally disastrous to the selves of other navigators who come
            from an opposite direction—it is this idea of God that has fostered
            selfishness in man, and deprived him of his self-reliance. Prayer is
            an ennobling action when it is an intense feeling, an ardent desire
            rushing forth from our very heart, for the good of other people, and
            when entirely detached from any selfish personal object; the craving
            for a beyond is natural and holy in man, but on the condition of
            sharing that bliss with others. One can understand and well
            appreciate the words of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“heathen”</span> Socrates, who declared in
            his profound though untaught wisdom, that:

            But official prayer—in favour of a public calamity, or for the
            benefit of one individual irrespective of losses to thousands—is the
            most ignoble of crimes, besides being an impertinent conceit and a
            superstition. This is the direct inheritance by spoliation from the
            Jehovites—the Jews of the Wilderness and of the Golden Calf.

            It is <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah,”</span> as will be presently
            shown, that suggested the necessity of veiling and screening this

            Moses had, at any rate, initiated his seventy Elders into the hidden
            truths, and thus the writers of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span>
            stand to a degree justified. Those of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament</span></span>
            have failed to do even so much, or so little. They have disfigured
            the grand central figure of Christ by their dogmas, and have led
            people ever since into millions of errors and the darkest crimes, in
            His holy name.

            It is evident that with the exception of Paul and Clement of
            Alexandria, who had been both initiated into the Mysteries, none of
            the Fathers knew much of the truth themselves. They were mostly
            uneducated, ignorant people; and if such as Augustine and
            Lactantius, or again the Venerable Bede and others, were so
            painfully ignorant until the time of Galileo<a href="#note_93" id="noteref_93" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>
            of the most vital truths taught in the Pagan temples—of the
            rotundity of the earth, for example, leaving the heliocentric system
            out of question—how great must have been the ignorance of the rest!
            Learning and sin were synonymous with the early Christians. Hence
            the accusations of dealing with the Devil lavished on the Pagan
            Philosophers.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            But truth must out. The Occultists, referred to as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the followers of the accursed Cain,”</span>
            by such writers as De Mirville, are now in a position to reverse the
            tables. That which was hitherto known only to the ancient and modern
            Kabalists in Europe and Asia, is now published and shown as being
            mathematically true. The author of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Key to the Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery or the Source of
                Measures</span></span>
            has now proved to general satisfaction, it is to be hoped, that the
            two great God-names, Jehovah and Elohim, stood, in one meaning of
            their numerical values, for a diameter and a circumference value,
            respectively; in other words, that they are numerical indices of
            geometrical relations; and finally that
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jehovah is Cain</span></em>

            This is not the first warning received by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“theological schools,”</span> which,
            however, no doubt knew it from the beginning, as did Clemens of
            Alexandria and others. But if it be so they will profit still less

            But, it may also be asked, why is it that the Asiatic religions,
            which have nothing of this sort to conceal and which proclaim quite
            openly the Esoterism of their doctrines, follow the same course? It
            is simply this: While the present, and no doubt enforced silence of
            the Church on this subject relates merely to the external or
            theoretical form of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>—the unveiling of the secrets of which would have involved no
            practical harm, had they been explained from the first—it is an
            entirely different question with Eastern Esoterism and Symbology.
            The grand central figure of the Gospels would have remained as
            unaffected by the symbolism of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span>
            being revealed, as would that of the Founder of Buddhism had the
            Brâhmanical writings of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, that preceded his birth, all been shown to be allegorical. Jesus
            of Nazareth, moreover, would have gained more than he would have
            lost had he been presented as a simple mortal left to be judged on
            his own precepts and merits, instead of being fathered on
            Christendom as a God whose many utterances and acts are now so open
            to criticism. On the other hand the symbols and allegorical sayings
            that veil the grand truths of Nature in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span>, the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>
            and especially in the Lamaist
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chagpa Thogmed</span></span>
            and other works, are quite of a different nature, and far more
            complicated in their secret meaning. While the Biblical glyphs have
            nearly all a triune foundation, those of the Eastern books are
            worked on the septenary principle. They are
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg054"></a> as closely related to the
            mysteries of Physics and Physiology, as to Psychism and the
            transcendental nature of cosmic elements and Theogony; unriddled
            they would prove more than injurious to the uninitiated; delivered
            into the hands of the present generations in their actual state of
            physical and intellectual development, in the absence of
            spirituality and even of practical morality, they would become
            absolutely disastrous.

            Nevertheless the secret teachings of the sanctuaries have not
            remained without witness; they have been made immortal in various
            ways. They have burst upon the world in hundreds of volumes full of
            the quaint, head-breaking phraseology of the Alchemist; they have
            flashed like irrepressible cataracts of Occult mystic lore from the
            pens of poets and bards. Genius alone had certain privileges in
            those dark ages when no dreamer could offer the world even a fiction
            without suiting his heaven and his earth to biblical text. To genius
            alone it was permitted, in those centuries of mental blindness, when
            the fear of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Office”</span> threw a
            thick veil over every cosmic and psychic truth, to reveal unimpeded
            some of the grandest truths of Initiation. Whence did Ariosto, in
            his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Orlando Furioso</span></span>, obtain his conception of that valley in the Moon, where after our
            death we can find the ideas and images of all that exists on earth?
            How came Dante to imagine the many descriptions given in his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inferno</span></span>—a new Johannine Apocalypse, a true Occult Revelation in verse—his
            visit and communion with the Souls of the Seven Spheres? In poetry
            and satire every Occult truth has been welcomed—none has been
            recognised as serious. The Comte de Gabalis is better known and
            appreciated than Porphyry and Iamblichus. Plato's mysterious
            Atlantis is proclaimed a fiction, while Noah's Deluge is to this day
            on the brain of certain Archæologists, who scoff at the archetypal
            world of Marcel Palingenius'
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zodiac</span></span>, and would resent as a personal injury being asked to discuss the
            four worlds of Mercury Trismegistus—the Archetypal, the Spiritual,
            the Astral and the Elementary, with three others behind the opened
            scene. Evidently civilised society is still but half prepared for
            the revelation. Hence, the Initiates will never give out the whole
            secret, until the bulk of mankind has changed its actual nature and
            is better prepared for truth. Clemens Alexandrinus was positively
            right in saying,

            The fact that the Occult Sciences have been withheld from the world
            at large, and denied by the Initiates to Humanity, has often been
            made matter of complaint. It has been alleged that the Guardians of
            the Secret Lore were selfish in withholding the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“treasures”</span> of Archaic Wisdom; that
            it was positively criminal to keep back such knowledge—<span class="tei tei-q">“if any”</span>—from the men of Science, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Yet there must have been some very good reasons for it, since from
            the very dawn of History such has been the policy of every
            Hierophant and <span class="tei tei-q">“Master.”</span> Pythagoras,
            the first Adept and real Scientist in pre-Christian Europe, is
            accused of having taught in public the immobility of the earth, and
            the rotatory motion of the stars around it, while he was declaring
            to his privileged Adepts his belief in the motion of the Earth as a
            planet, and in the heliocentric system. The reasons for such
            secresy, however, are many and were never made a mystery of. The
            chief cause was given in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>. It may now be repeated.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Some of the reasons for this secresy may here be given.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The fundamental law and master-key of practical Theurgy, in its
            chief applications to the serious study of cosmic and sidereal, of
            psychic and spiritual, mysteries was, and still is, that which was
            called by the Greek Neoplatonists
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Theophania.”</span> In its
            generally-accepted meaning this is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“communication between the Gods (or God) and those initiated
              mortals who are spiritually fit to enjoy such an
              intercourse.”</span>
            Esoterically, however, it signifies more than this. For it is not
            only the presence of a God, but an actual—howbeit
            temporary—incarnation, the blending, so to say, of the personal
            Deity, the Higher Self, with man—its representative or agent on
            earth. As a general law, the Highest God, the Over-soul of the human
            being (Âtma-Buddhi), only overshadows the individual during his
            life, for purposes of instruction and revelation; or as Roman
            Catholics—who erroneously call that Over-soul the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Guardian Angel”</span>—would say,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It stands outside and watches.”</span> But
            in the case of the theophanic mystery, it incarnates itself in the
            Theurgist for purposes of revelation. When the incarnation is
            temporary, during those mysterious trances or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ecstasy,”</span> which Plotinus defined as

              <span style="font-size: 90%">The liberation of the mind from its finite consciousness,
                becoming one and identified with the Infinite,</span>

          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            this sublime condition is very short. The human soul, being the
            offspring or emanation of its God, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father and the Son”</span> become one,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the divine fountain flowing like a stream into its human

            In exceptional cases, however, the mystery becomes complete; the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg058"></a> Word is made Flesh in
            real fact, the individual becoming divine in the full sense of the
            term, since his personal God has made of him his permanent life-long
            tabernacle—<span class="tei tei-q">“the temple of God,”</span> as
            Paul says.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Now that which is meant here by the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em>
            God of Man is, of course, not his seventh Principle alone, as
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>
            and in essence that is merely a beam of the infinite Ocean of Light.
            In conjunction with our Divine Soul, the Buddhi, it cannot be called
            a Duad, as it otherwise might, since, though formed from Âtmâ and
            Buddhi (the two higher Principles), the former is no entity but an
            emanation from the Absolute, and indivisible in reality from it. The
            personal God is not the Monad, but indeed the prototype of the
            latter, what for want of a better term we call the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifested</span></em>
            Kâranâtmâ<a href="#note_99" id="noteref_99" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a>
            (Causal Soul), one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“seven”</span> and
            chief reservoirs of the human Monads or Egos. The latter are
            gradually formed and strengthened during their incarnation-cycle by
            constant additions of individuality from the personalities in which
            incarnates that androgynous, half-spiritual, half-terrestrial
            principle, partaking of both heaven and earth, called by the
            Vedântins Jîva and Vijñânamaya Kosha, and by the Occultists the
            Manas (mind); that, in short, which uniting itself partially with
            the Monad, incarnates in each new birth. In perfect unity with its
            (seventh) Principle, the Spirit unalloyed, it is the divine Higher
            Self, as every student of Theosophy knows. After every new
            incarnation Buddhi-Manas culls, so to say, the aroma of the flower
            called personality, the purely earthly residue of which—its dregs—is
            left to fade out as a shadow. This is the most difficult—because so
            transcendentally metaphysical—portion of the doctrine.

            As is repeated many a time in this and other works, it is not the
            Philosophers, Sages, and Adepts of antiquity who can ever be charged
            with idolatry. It is they in fact, who, recognising divine unity,
            were the only ones, owing to their initiation into the mysteries of
            Esotericism, to understand correctly the ὑπόνοια (hyponéa), or
            under-meaning of the anthropomorphism of the so-called Angels, Gods,
            and spiritual Beings of every kind. Each, worshipping the one Divine
            Essence that pervades the whole world of Nature, reverenced, but
            never worshipped or idolised, any of these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> whether high or low—not even

            the sentence meaning that man has within himself the seven pale
            reflections of the seven divine Hierarchies; his Higher Self is,
            therefore, in itself but the refracted beam of the direct Ray. He
            who regards the latter as an Entity, in the usual sense of the term,
            is one of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“infidels and atheists,”</span> spoken of by
            Epicurus, for he fastens on that God

            The Adept and the Occultist know that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“what are styled the Gods are only the first principles”</span>
            (Aristotle). None the less they are intelligent, conscious, and

            four—Kumâras or <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind-Born Sons”</span> of
            Brahmâ. And it is they again, the Dhyân Chohans, who are the
            prototypes in the æonic eternity of lower Gods and hierarchies of
            divine Beings, at the lowest end of which ladder of being are
            we—men.

            Thus perchance Polytheism, when philosophically understood, may be a
            degree higher than even the Monotheism of the Protestant, say, who
            limits and conditions the Deity in whom he persists in seeing the
            Infinite, but whose supposed actions make of that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Absolute and Infinite”</span> the most
            absurd paradox in Philosophy. From this standpoint Roman Catholicism
            itself is immeasurably higher and more logical than Protestantism,
            though the Roman Church has been pleased to adopt the exotericism of
            the heathen <span class="tei tei-q">“multitude”</span> and to reject
            the Philosophy of pure Esotericism.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Thus every mortal has his immortal counterpart, or rather his
            Archetype, in heaven. This means that the former is indissolubly
            united to the latter, in each of his incarnations, and for the
            duration of the cycle of births; only it is by the spiritual and
            intellectual Principle in him, entirely distinct from the lower
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self</span></em>, never through the earthly personality. Some of these are even
            liable to break the union altogether, in case of absence in the
            moral individual of binding,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, of spiritual ties. Truly, as Paracelsus puts it in his quaint,
            tortured <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg060"></a> phraseology, man with his
            three (compound) Spirits is suspended like a fœtus by all three to
            the matrix of the Macrocosm; the thread which holds him united being
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Thread-Soul,”</span> Sûtrâtmâ, and
            Taijasa (the <span class="tei tei-q">“Shining”</span>) of the
            Vedântins. And it is through this spiritual and intellectual
            Principle in man, through Taijasa—the Shining,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“because it has the luminous internal organ as its
              associate”</span>—that man is thus united to his heavenly prototype, never through
            his lower inner self or Astral Body, for which there remains in most
            cases nothing but to fade out.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Occultism, or Theurgy, teaches the means of producing such union.
            But it is the actions of man—his personal merit alone—that can
            produce it on earth, or determine its duration. This lasts from a
            few seconds—a flash—to several hours, during which time the
            Theurgist or Theophanist is that overshadowing

            endowed for the time being with relative omniscience and
            omnipotence. With such perfect (divine) Adepts as Buddha<a href="#note_102" id="noteref_102" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>
            and others such a hypostatical state of avatâric condition may last
            during the whole life; whereas in the case of full Initiates, who
            have not yet reached the perfect state of Jîvanmukta,<a href="#note_103" id="noteref_103" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>
            Theopneusty, when in full sway, results for the high Adept in a full
            recollection of everything seen, heard, or sensed.

            For one less perfect it will end only in a partial, indistinct

            finally complete oblivion of the mysteries seen during this

            returns to his waking state and physical senses, depends on his
            spiritual and psychic purification, the greatest enemy of spiritual
            memory being man's physical brain, the organ of his sensuous nature.

            The above states are described for a clearer comprehension of terms
            used in this work. There are so many and such various conditions and
            states that even a Seer is liable to confound one with the other.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg061"></a> To repeat: the Greek,
            rarely-used word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Theophania,”</span> meant
            more with the Neoplatonists than it does with the modern maker of
            dictionaries. The compound word,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Theophania”</span> (from

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em>
            incarnation. When Simon the Magician claimed to be
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God the Father,”</span> what he wanted to
            convey was just that which has been explained, namely, that he was a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em>
            incarnation of his own Father, whether we see in the latter an
            Angel, a God, or a Spirit; therefore he was called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that power of God which is called great,”</span><a href="#note_105" id="noteref_105" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>

            lower self—man.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            This is one of the several mysteries of being and incarnation.
            Another is that when an Adept reaches during his lifetime that state
            of holiness and purity that makes him
            <span class="tei tei-q">“equal to the Angels,”</span> then at death
            his apparitional or astral body becomes as solid and tangible as was
            the late body, and is transformed into the real man.<a href="#note_106" id="noteref_106" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a>
            The old physical body, falling off like the cast-off serpent's skin,
            the body of the <span class="tei tei-q">“new”</span> man remains
            either visible or, at the option of the Adept, disappears from view,
            surrounded as it is by the Âkâshic shell that screens it. In the
            latter case there are three ways open to the Adept:
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            (1.) He may remain in the earth's sphere (Vâyu or Kâma-loka), in
            that ethereal locality concealed from human sight save during
            flashes of clairvoyance. In this case his astral body, owing to its
            great purity and spirituality, having lost the conditions required
            for Âkâshic light (the nether or terrestrial ether) to absorb its
            semi-material particles, the Adept will have to remain in the
            company of disintegrating shells—doing no good or useful work. This,
            of course, cannot be.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            (2.) He can by a supreme effort of will merge entirely into, and get
            united with, his Monad. By doing so, however, he would (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) deprive his Higher Self of posthumous Samâdhi—a bliss which is
            not real Nirvâna—the astral, however pure, being too earthly for
            such state; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) he would thereby open himself to Karmic law; the action being, in
            fact, the outcome of personal selfishness—of reaping the fruits
            produced by and for oneself—alone.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            (3.) The Adept has the option of renouncing conscious Nirvâna and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg062"></a> rest, to work on earth
            for the good of mankind. This he can do in a two-fold way: either,
            as above said, by consolidating his astral body into physical
            appearance, he can reassume the self-same personality; or he can
            avail himself of an entirely new physical body, whether that of a
            newly-born infant or—as Shankarâchârya is reported to have done with
            the body of a dead Râjah—by
            <span class="tei tei-q">“entering a deserted sheath,”</span>
            and living in it as long as he chooses. This is what is called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“continuous existence.”</span> The Section
            entitled
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Mystery about Buddha”</span> will throw
            additional light on this theory, to the profane incomprehensible, or
            to the generality simply
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absurd</span></em>. Such is the doctrine taught, everyone having the choice of either
            fathoming it still deeper, or of leaving it unnoticed.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The above is simply a small portion of what might have been given in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>, had the time come then, as it has now. One cannot study and
            profit by Occult Science, unless one gives himself up to it—heart,
            soul, and body. Some of its truths are too awful, too dangerous, for
            the average mind. None can toy and play with such terrible weapons
            with impunity. Therefore it is, as St. Paul has it,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“unlawful”</span> to speak of them. Let us
            accept the reminder and talk only of that which is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“lawful.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The quotation on p. 56 relates, moreover, only to psychic or
            spiritual Magic. The practical teachings of Occult Science are
            entirely different, and few are the strong minds fitted for them. As
            to ecstasy, and such like kinds of self-illumination, this may be
            obtained by oneself and without any teacher or initiation, for
            ecstacy is reached by an inward command and control of Self over the
            physical Ego; as to obtaining mastery over the forces of Nature,
            this requires a long training, or the capacity of one born a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“natural Magician.”</span> Meanwhile, those
            who possess neither of the requisite qualifications are strongly
            advised to limit themselves to purely spiritual development. But
            even this is difficult, as the first necessary qualification is an
            unshakable belief in one's own powers and the Deity within oneself;
            otherwise a man would simply develop into an irresponsible medium.
            Throughout the whole mystic literature of the ancient world we
            detect the same idea of spiritual Esoterism, that the personal God
            exists within, nowhere outside, the worshipper. That personal Deity
            is no vain breath, or a fiction, but an immortal Entity, the
            Initiator of the Initiates, now that the heavenly or Celestial
            Initiators of primitive humanity—the Shishta of the preceding
            cycles—are no more among us. Like an under-current,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg063"></a> rapid and clear, it runs
            without mixing its crystalline purity with the muddy and troubled
            waters of dogmatism, an enforced anthropomorphic Deity and religious
            intolerance. We find this idea in the tortured and barbarous
            phraseology of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Codex Nazaræus</span></span>, and in the superb Neoplatonic language of the Fourth Gospel of
            the later Religion, in the oldest
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Veda</span></span>
            and in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Avesta</span></span>, in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abhidharma</span></span>, in Kapila's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sânkhya</span></span>, and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavad Gîtâ</span></span>. We cannot attain Adeptship and Nirvâna, Bliss and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Kingdom of Heaven,”</span> unless we link
            ourselves indissolubly with our Rex Lux, the Lord of Splendour and
            of Light, our immortal God within us.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Aham eva param Brahman”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“I am verily the Supreme Brahman”</span>—has ever been the one living truth in the heart and mind of the
            Adepts, and it is this which helps the Mystic to become one. One
            must first of all recognise one's own immortal Principle, and then
            only can one conquer, or take the Kingdom of Heaven by violence.
            Only this has to be achieved by the higher—not the middle, nor the
            third—man, the last one being of dust. Nor can the second man, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son”</span>—on this plane, as his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span> is the Son on a still higher
            plane—do anything without the assistance of the first, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father.”</span> But to succeed one has to
            identify oneself with one's divine Parent.

            Thus says Paul, mentioning but the dual and trinitarian man for the
            better comprehension of the non-initiated. But this is not all, for
            the Delphic injunction has to be fulfilled: man must know himself in
            order to become a perfect Adept. How few can acquire the knowledge,
            however, not merely in its inner mystical, but even in its literal
            sense, for there are two meanings in this command of the Oracle.
            This is the doctrine of Buddha and the Bodhisattvas pure and simple.

            Vedântin. Nor is the latter assertion more blasphemous than the
            Pauline—if there were any blasphemy in either, which is denied. Only
            the Vedântin, who never refers to his body as being himself, or even
            a part of himself, or aught else but an illusory form for others to
            see him in, constructs his assertion more openly and sincerely than
            was done by Paul.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The Delphic command
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Know thyself”</span> was perfectly
            comprehensible to every nation of old. So it is now, save to the
            Christians, since, with the exception of the Mussulmans, it is part
            and parcel of every Eastern religion, including the Kabalistically
            instructed Jews. To understand its full meaning, however,
            necessitates, first of all, belief in Reincarnation and all its
            mysteries; not as laid down in the doctrine of the French
            Reincarnationists of the Allan Kardec school, but as they are
            expounded and taught by Esoteric Philosophy. Man must, in short,
            know who he was, before he arrives at knowing what he is. And how
            many are there among Europeans who are capable of developing within
            themselves an absolute belief in their past and future
            reincarnations, in general, even as a law, let alone mystic
            knowledge of one's immediately precedent life? Early education,
            tradition and training of thought, everything is opposing itself
            during their whole lives to such a belief. Cultured people have been
            brought up in that most pernicious idea that the wide difference
            found between the units of one and the same mankind, or even race,
            is the result of chance; that the gulf between man and man in their
            respective social positions, birth, intellect, physical and mental
            capacities—every one of which qualifications has a direct influence
            on every human life—that all this is simply due to blind hazard,
            only the most pious among them finding equivocal consolation in the
            idea that it is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the will of God.”</span> They have never
            analysed, never stopped to think of the depth of the opprobrium that
            is thrown upon their God, once the grand and most equitable law of
            the manifold re-births of man upon this earth is foolishly rejected.

            Magic is a dual power: nothing is easier than to turn it into
            Sorcery;
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an evil thought suffices for it</span></em>. Therefore while theoretical Occultism is harmless, and may do
            good, practical Magic, or the fruits of the Tree of Life and

            or otherwise the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Science of Good and Evil,”</span> is
            fraught with dangers and perils. For the study of theoretical
            Occultism there are, no doubt, a number of works that may be read
            with profit, besides such books as the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Finer Forces of Nature</span></span>, etc., the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sepher Jetzirah</span></span>,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Book of Enoch</span></span>, Franck's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, and many Hermetic treatises. These are scarce in European
            languages, but works in Latin by the mediæval Philosophers,
            generally known as Alchemists and Rosicrucians, are plentiful. But
            even the perusal of these may prove dangerous for the unguided
            student. If approached without the right key to them, and if the
            student is unfit, owing to mental incapacity, for Magic, and is thus
            unable to discern the Right from the Left Path, let him take our
            advice and leave this study alone; he will only bring on himself and
            on his family unexpected woes and sorrows, never suspecting whence
            they come, nor what are the powers awakened by his mind being bent
            on them. Works for advanced students are many, but these can be
            placed at the disposal of only sworn or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“pledged”</span> chelâs (disciples), those
            who have pronounced the ever-binding oath, and who are, therefore,
            helped and protected. For all other purposes, well-intentioned as
            such works may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"></a> be, they can only mislead
            the unwary and guide him imperceptibly to Black Magic or Sorcery—if

            the numerals. We say dangerous, because they are the most prompt to
            produce effects and results, and this with or without the
            experimenter's will, even without his knowledge. Some students are
            apt to doubt this statement, simply because after manipulating these
            numerals they have failed to notice any dire physical manifestation
            or result. Such results would be found the least dangerous: it is
            the moral causes produced and the various events developed and
            brought to an unforeseen crisis, that would testify to the truth of

            Both the Western and the Eastern students of the Hidden Wisdom hold
            to this axiomatic truth. Only the latter are perhaps more sincere in
            their confessions. Instead of putting a mask on their Science, they
            show her face openly, even if they do veil carefully her heart and
            soul before the inappreciative public and the profane, who are ever
            ready to abuse the most sacred truths for their own selfish ends.
            But Unity is the real basis of the Occult Sciences—physical and
            metaphysical. This is shown even by Éliphas Lévi, the learned

            The meaning of this Unity in Plurality in

            by the means of transcendental methods, by numerals, as by the
            correspondences between soul and the Soul. Names, in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            as in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, such as Jehovah, Adam Kadmon, Eve, Cain, Abel, Enoch, are all of
            them more intimately connected, by geometrical and astronomical
            relations, with Physiology (or Phallicism) than with Theology or
            Religion. Little as people are as yet prepared to admit it, this
            will be shown to be a fact. If all those names are symbols for

            <span class="tei tei-q">“God geometrises”</span> was accepted by
            both Âryans and Jews; but while the former applied their Science of
            Correspondences to veil the most spiritual and sublime truths of
            Nature, the latter used their acumen to conceal only one—to them the
            most divine—of the mysteries of Evolution, namely, that of birth and
            generation, and then they deified the organs of the latter.

            Apart from this, every cosmogony, from the earliest to the latest,

            But the day has come when the gross conceptions of our forefathers
            during the Middle Ages can no longer satisfy the thoughtful
            religionist. The mediæval Alchemist and Mystic are now transformed
            into the sceptical Chemist and Physicist; and most of them are found
            to have turned away from truth, on account of the purely
            anthropomorphic ideas, the gross Materialism, of the forms in which
            it is presented to them. Therefore, future generations have either
            to be gradually initiated into the truths underlying Exoteric
            Religions, including their own, or be left to break the feet of clay
            of the last of the gilded idols. No educated man or woman would turn
            away from any of the now called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“superstitions”</span> which they believe to
            be based on nursery tales and ignorance, if they could only see the
            basis of fact that underlies every
            <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition.”</span> But let them once
            learn for a certainty that there is hardly a claim in the Occult
            Sciences that is not founded on philosophical and scientific facts
            in Nature, and they will pursue the study of those Sciences with the
            same, if not with greater, ardour than that they have expended in
            shunning them. This cannot be achieved at
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg071"></a> once, for to benefit
            mankind such truths have to be revealed gradually and with great
            caution, the public mind not being prepared for them. However much
            the Agnostics of our age may find themselves in the mental attitude
            demanded by Modern Science, people are always apt to cling to their
            old hobbies so long as the remembrance of them lasts. They are like
            the Emperor Julian—called the Apostate, because he loved truth too
            well to accept aught else—who, though in his last Theophany he
            beheld his beloved Gods as pale, worn-out, and hardly discernible
            shadows, nevertheless clung to them. Let, then, the world cling to
            its Gods, to whatever plane or realm they may belong. The true
            Occultist would be guilty of high treason to mankind, were he to
            break for ever the old deities before he could replace them with the
            whole and unadulterated truth—and this he cannot do as yet.
            Nevertheless, the reader may be allowed to learn at least the
            alphabet of that truth. He may be shown, at any rate, what the Gods
            and Goddesses of the Pagans, denounced as demons by the Church, are
            not, if he cannot learn the whole and final truth as to what they
            are. Let him assure himself that the Hermetic
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Tres Matres,”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Three Mothers”</span> of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sepher Jetzirah</span></span>
            are one and the same thing; that they are no Demon-Goddesses, but
            Light, Heat, and Electricity, and then, perchance, the learned
            classes will spurn them no longer. After this, the Rosicrucian
            Illuminati may find followers even in the Royal Academies, which
            will be more prepared, perhaps, than they are now, to admit the
            grand truths of archaic Natural Philosophy, especially when their
            learned members shall have assured themselves that, in the dialect
            of Hermes, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Three Mothers”</span> stand
            as symbols for the whole of the forces or agencies which have a

            shows its

            such as are very little warranted by the facts discovered. His
            impression seems to be that because the Jewish biblical names are
            all astronomical, therefore the Scriptures of all the other nations
            can be
            <span class="tei tei-q">“only this and nothing more.”</span> But
            this is a great mistake of the erudite and wonderfully acute author
            of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Source of Measures</span></span>, if he really thinks so. The

            unlocks but a certain portion of the hieratic writings of these two
            nations, and leaves those of other peoples untouched. His idea is

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“is only that sublime Science upon which Masonry is based”</span>; in fact he regards Masonry as the substance of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, and the latter as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“rational basis of the Hebrew text of Holy Writ.”</span>

            geometrical secrets that lay concealed for long æons in her strong
            bosom—the measurements and proportions of the Kosmos, our little
            Earth included—what wonder that he should have made use of his
            knowledge? The Esoterism of Egypt was that of the whole world at one
            time. During the long ages of the Third Race it had been the
            heirloom, in common, of the whole of mankind, received from their
            Instructors, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Light,”</span> the
            primeval Seven. There was a time also when the Wisdom-Religion was
            not symbolical, for it became Esoteric only gradually, the change
            being necessitated by misuse and by the Sorcery of the Atlanteans.
            For it was the <span class="tei tei-q">“misuse”</span> only, and not
            the use, of the divine gift that led the men of the Fourth Race to
            Black Magic and Sorcery, and finally to become
            <span class="tei tei-q">“forgetful of Wisdom”</span>; while those of
            the Fifth Race, the inheritors of the Rishis of the Tretâ Yuga, used
            their powers to atrophise such gifts in mankind in general, and
            then, as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elect Root,”</span> dispersed.
            Those who escaped the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Flood”</span> preserved only its
            memory, and a belief founded on the knowledge of their direct
            fathers of one remove, that such a Science existed, and was now
            jealously guarded by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Elect Root”</span> exalted by Enoch. But
            there must again come a time when man shall once more become what he
            was during the second Yuga (age), when his probationary cycle shall
            be over and he shall gradually become what he was—semi-corporeal and
            pure. Does not Plato, the Initiate, tell us in the

            Unwilling that his chosen people—chosen by him—should remain as
            grossly idolatrous as the profane masses that surrounded them, Moses
            utilised his knowledge of the cosmogonical mysteries of the Pyramid,
            to build upon it the Genesiacal Cosmogony in symbols and glyphs.
            This was more accessible to the minds of the

            He invented nothing but the outward garb, added not one iota; but in
            this he merely followed the example of older nations and Initiates.
            If he clothed the grand truths revealed to him by his Hierophant
            under the most ingenious imagery, he did it to meet the requirements
            of the Israelites; that stiff-necked race would accept of no God

            developed in him on Mount Sinai, when communing with his own
            personal God—his divine Self. Moses understood the great danger of
            delivering such truths to the selfish, for he understood the fable
            of Prometheus and remembered the past. Hence, he veiled them from
            the profanation of public gaze and gave them out allegorically. And
            this is why his biographer says of him, that when he descended from

            It is more than likely, that the Protestants in the days of the
            Reformation knew nothing of the true origin of Christianity, or, to
            be more explicit and correct, of Latin Ecclesiasticism. Nor is it
            probable that the Greek Church knew much of it, the separation
            between the two having occurred at a time when, in the struggle for
            political power the Latin Church was securing, at any cost, the
            alliance of the highly educated, the ambitious and influential
            Pagans, while these were willing to assume the outward appearance of
            the new worship, provided they were themselves kept in power. There
            is no need to remind the reader here of the details of that
            struggle, well-known to every educated man. It is certain that the
            highly cultured Gnostics and their leaders—such men as Saturnilus,
            an uncompromising ascetic, as Marcion, Valentinus, Basilides,
            Menander and Cerinthus—were not stigmatised by the (now) Latin
            Church because they were heretics, nor because their tenets and
            practices were indeed
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ob turpitudinem portentosam nimium et horribilem</span></span>,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“monstrous, revolting abominations,”</span>
            as Baronius says of those of Carpocrates; but simply because they
            knew too much of fact and truth. Kenneth R. H. Mackenzie correctly
            remarks:

            Unwilling to accept the responsibility of gratuitous assumptions,
            the writer deems it best to prove this inference by more than one
            personal and defiant admission of an ardent Roman Catholic writer,
            evidently entrusted with the delicate task by the Vatican. The
            Marquis de Mirville
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg077"></a> makes desperate efforts
            to explain in the Catholic interest certain remarkable discoveries
            in Archæology and Palæography, though the Church is cleverly made to
            remain outside of the quarrel and defence. This is undeniably shown
            by his ponderous volumes addressed to the Academy of France between
            1803 and 1865. Seizing the pretext of drawing the attention of the
            materialistic <span class="tei tei-q">“Immortals”</span> to the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“epidemic of Spiritualism,”</span> the
            invasion of Europe and America by a numberless host of Satanic
            forces, he directs his efforts towards proving the same, by giving
            the full Genealogies and the Theogony of the Christian and Pagan
            Deities, and by drawing parallels between the two. All such
            wonderful likenesses and identities are only
            <span class="tei tei-q">“seeming and superficial,”</span> he assures
            the reader. Christian symbols, and even characters, Christ, the
            Virgin, Angels and Saints, he tells them, were all personated
            centuries beforehand by the fiends of hell, in order to discredit
            eternal truth by their ungodly copies. By their knowledge of
            futurity the devils anticipated events, having
            <span class="tei tei-q">“discovered the secrets of the Angels.”</span>
            Heathen Deities, all the Sun-Gods named Soters—Saviours—born of
            immaculate mothers and dying a violent death, were only Ferouers<a href="#note_129" id="noteref_129" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a>—as they were called by the Zoroastrians—the demon-ante-dated

            The danger of recognition of such
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facsimiles</span></em>
            had indeed lately become dangerously great. It had lingered
            threateningly in the air, hanging like a sword of Damocles over the
            Church, since the days of Voltaire, Dupuis and other writers on
            similar lines. The discoveries
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg078"></a> of the Egyptologists, the
            finding of Assyrian and Babylonian pre-Mosaic relics bearing the
            legend of Moses<a href="#note_130" id="noteref_130" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a>
            and especially the many rationalistic works published in England,
            such as
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Supernatural Religion</span></span>
            made recognition unavoidable. Hence the appearance of Protestant and
            Roman Catholic writers deputed to explain the inexplicable; to
            reconcile the fact of Divine Revelation with the mystery that the
            divine personages, rites, dogmas and symbols of Christianity were so
            often identical with those of the several great heathen religions.
            The former—the Protestant defenders—tried to explain it, on the
            ground of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“prophetic, precursory ideas”</span>; the
            Latinists, such as De Mirville, by inventing a double set of Angels
            and Gods, the one divine and true, the other—the earlier—<span class="tei tei-q">“copies ante-dating the originals”</span>
            and due to a clever plagiarism by the Evil One. The Protestant
            stratagem is an old one, that of the Roman Catholics is so old that
            it has been forgotten, and is as good as new. Dr. Lundy's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monumental Christianity</span></span>
            and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A Miracle in Stone</span></span>
            belong to the first attempts. De Mirville's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pneumatologie</span></span>
            to the second. In India and China, every such effort on the part of
            the Scotch and other missionaries ends in laughter, and does no
            harm; the plan devised by the Jesuits is more serious. De Mirville's
            volumes are thus very important, as they proceed from a source which
            has undeniably the greatest learning of the age at its service, and
            this coupled with all the craft and casuistry that the sons of
            Loyola can furnish. The Marquis de Mirville was evidently helped by
            the acutest minds in the service of Rome.

            He begins by not only admitting the justice of every imputation and
            charge made against the Latin Church as to the originality of her
            dogmas, but by taking a seeming delight in anticipating such
            charges; for he points to every dogma of Christianity as having
            existed in Pagan rituals in Antiquity. The whole Pantheon of Heathen
            Deities is passed in review by him, and each is shown to have had
            some point of resemblance with the Trinitarian personages and Mary.
            There is hardly a mystery, a dogma, or a rite in the Latin Church
            that is not shown by the author as having been
            <span class="tei tei-q">“parodied by the Curvati”</span>—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Curved,”</span> the Devils. All this being
            admitted and explained, the Symbologists ought to be silenced. And
            so they would be, if there were no materialistic critics to reject
            such omnipotency of the Devil in this world. For, if Rome admits the
            likenesses, she also claims the right of judgment between
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"></a> the true and the false
            Avatâra, the real and the unreal God, between the original and the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Obvious”</span> truly, and something else
            besides. For, if Jesus pronounced the words in the sense attributed
            to him, then he must have read the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Enoch</span></span>—a purely Kabalistic, Occult work, and he therefore recognised the
            worth and value of a treatise now declared apocryphal by his
            Churches. Moreover, he could not have been ignorant that these words
            belonged to the oldest ritual of Initiation.<a href="#note_134" id="noteref_134" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a>
            And if he had not read it, and the sentence belongs to John, or
            whoever wrote the Fourth Gospel, then what reliance can be placed on
            the authenticity of other sayings and parables attributed to the
            Christian Saviour?

            Thus, De Mirville's illustration is an unfortunate one. Every other
            proof brought by the Church to show the infernal character of the
            ante-and-anti-Christian copyists may be as easily disposed of. This
            is perhaps unfortunate, but it is a fact, nevertheless—<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">Magna est veritas et prevalebit</span></span>.

            Initiates, have a key to its inner meaning; a tale sublime in its

            repertory of invented personages in its older Jewish portions, and
            of dark sayings and parables in its later additions, and thus quite
            misleading to anyone ignorant of its Esotericism. Moreover it is

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span>, have been taken bodily from the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Enoch</span></span>, for this is as evident as the sun in heaven. The whole of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>
            was adapted to fit in with the facts given, and this accounts for

            as the Christians have subsequently refused to admit it among their
            canonical works. The fact that the Apostle Jude and many of the
            Christian Fathers referred to it as a revelation and a sacred
            volume, is, however, an excellent proof that the early Christians
            accepted it; among these the most learned—as, for instance, Clement
            of Alexandria—understood Christianity and its doctrines in quite a
            different light from their modern successors, and viewed Christ
            under an aspect that Occultists only can appreciate. The early
            Nazarenes and Chrestians, as Justin Martyr calls them, were the
            followers of Jesus, of the true Chrestos and Christos of Initiation;
            whereas, the modern Christians, especially those of the West, may be
            Papists, Greeks, Calvinists, or Lutherans, but can hardly be called
            Christians,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the followers of Jesus, the Christ.

            Thus the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Enoch</span></span>
            is entirely symbolical. It relates to the history of the human Races
            and of their early relation to Theogony, the symbols being
            interblended with astronomical and cosmic mysteries.

            remodelled, and therefore it had to disappear, disfigured fragments
            alone having been left of it. The dream about the cows, the black,
            red and white heifers, relates to the first Races, their division
            and disappearance. Chapter lxxxviii, in which one of the four Angels
            <span class="tei tei-q">“went to the white cows and taught them a mystery,”</span>
            after which, the mystery being born

            <span class="tei tei-q">“mystery of the Hermaphrodite”</span> so
            called, having reference to the birth of the first human Races as
            they are now. The well-known rite in India, one that has survived in
            that patriarchal country to this day, known as the passage, or
            rebirth through the cow—a ceremony to which those of lower castes
            who are desirous of becoming Brâhmans have to submit—has originated
            in this mystery. Let any Eastern Occultist read with careful
            attention the above-named chapter in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Enoch</span></span>, and he will find that the

            relate in truth to the trials of the Neophyte and the mysteries of
            initiation, whether in India or Egypt, and to that most terrible
            penalty incurred by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“wolves”</span>—those who reveal
            indiscriminately that which is only for the knowledge of the Elect

            their respective schools; and in our own more modern epoch a number
            of Fire-Philosophers, of Rosicrucians and Adepts. All of these are

            grandfather of Noah who, in his turn, is the personification of the
            mankind of the Fifth, struggling with that of the Fourth
            Root-Race—the great period of the revealed and profaned Mysteries,
            when the <span class="tei tei-q">“sons of God”</span> coming down on
            Earth took for wives the daughters of men, and taught them the
            secrets of the Angels; in other words, when the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mind-born”</span> men of the Third Race
            mixed themselves with those of the Fourth, and the divine Science
            was gradually brought down by men to Sorcery.

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The cosmogony of Hermes is as veiled as the Mosaic system, only it
            is upon its face far more in harmony with the doctrines of the
            Secret Sciences and even of Modern Science. Says the thrice great
            Trismegistus,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the hand that shaped the world out of formless pre-existent
              matter is no hand”</span>; to which
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
            is made to reply,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The world was created out of nothing,”</span>
            although the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            denies such a meaning in its opening sentences. The Kabalists have
            never, any more than have the Indian Âryans, admitted such an
            absurdity. With them, Fire, or Heat, and Motion<a href="#note_163" id="noteref_163" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">163</span></span></a>
            were chiefly instrumental in the formation of the world out of
            preëxisting Matter. The Parabrahman and Mûlaprakriti of the
            Vedântins are the prototypes of the En Suph and Shekinah of the
            Kabalists. Aditi is the original of Sephira, and the Prajâpatis are
            the elder brothers of the Sephiroth. The nebular theory of Modern
            Science, with all its mysteries, is solved in the cosmogony of the
            Archaic Doctrine; and the paradoxical though very scientific
            enunciation, that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“cooling causes contraction and contraction causes heat;
              therefore cooling causes heat,”</span>
            is shown as the chief agency in the formation of the worlds, and
            especially of our sun and solar system.

            wilderness, where he lived in a cave for twelve years surrounded by
            faithful disciples, and finally died there amid signs and wonders.<a href="#note_170" id="noteref_170" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a>
            His teachings on the origin of the Secret Doctrine, or, as he also
            calls it, the Secret Wisdom, are the same as those found in the
            East, with the exception that in place of the Chief of a Host of
            Planetary Spirits he puts
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span> saying that this Wisdom was
            first taught by God himself to a certain number of Elect Angels;
            whereas in the Eastern Doctrine the saying is different, as will be
            seen.

            one is able to locate, and which is the despair of both Geographers
            and Christian Theologians—the region in which the Brâhman places his

            Round this locality, which still exists, the traditions of the
            Garden of Eden were built. From these regions the Greeks obtained
            their Parnassus<a href="#note_172" id="noteref_172" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a>; and thence proceeded most of the biblical personages, some of
            them in their day men, some demi-gods and heroes, some—though very
            few—myths, the astronomical doubles of the former. Abram was one of
            them—a Chaldæan Brâhman,<a href="#note_173" id="noteref_173" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a>
            says the legend, transformed later, after he had repudiated his Gods
            and left his Ur (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pur</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“town”</span>?) in Chaldæa, into

            (or A-braham) <span class="tei tei-q">“no-brâhman”</span> who
            emigrated. Abram becoming the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“father of many nations”</span> is thus
            explained. The student of Occultism has to bear in mind that every
            God and hero in ancient Pantheons (that of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            included), has three biographies in the narrative, so to say,
            running parallel with each other and each connected with one of the
            aspects of the hero—historical, astronomical and perfectly mythical,
            the last serving to connect the other two together and smooth away
            the asperities and discordancies in the narrative, and gathering
            into one or more symbols the verities of the first two. Localities
            are made to correspond with astronomical
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg095"></a> and even with psychic
            events. History was thus made captive by ancient Mystery, to become
            later on the great Sphynx of the nineteenth century. Only, instead

            Œdipus, before he forces her into the sea of speculations in which
            the Sphynx is drowned and perishes. This has now become
            self-evident, not only through the Secret Teachings, parsimoniously
            as they may be given, but by earnest and learned Symbologists and
            even Geometricians. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Key to the Hebrew Egyptian Mystery</span></span>, in which a learned Mason of Cincinnati, Mr. Ralston Skinner,
            unveils the riddle of a God, with such ungodly ways about him as the
            Biblical Jah-ve, is followed by the establishment of a learned
            society under the presidentship of a gentleman from Ohio and four
            vice-presidents, one of whom is Piazzi Smyth, the well-known
            Astronomer and Egyptologist. The Director of the Royal Observatory
            in Scotland and author of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Great Pyramid, Pharaonic by name, Humanitarian by fact, its
                Marvels, Mysteries, and its Teachings</span></span>, is seeking to prove the same problem as the American author and
            Mason: namely, that the English system of measurement is the same as
            that used by the ancient Egyptians in the construction of their
            Pyramid, or in Mr. Skinner's own words that the Pharaonic
            <span class="tei tei-q">“source of measures”</span> originated the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“British inch and the ancient cubit.”</span>
            It <span class="tei tei-q">“originated”</span> much more than this,
            as will be fully demonstrated before the end of the next century.
            Not only is everything in Western religion related to measures,
            geometrical figures, and time-calculations, the principal
            period-durations being founded on most of the historical
            personages,<a href="#note_175" id="noteref_175" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>

            From Abraham to Enoch's Taro there seems to be a considerable
            distance, yet the two are closely related by more than one link.
            Gaffarel has shown that the four symbolical animals on the
            twenty-first key of the Taro, at the third septenary, are the
            Teraphim of the Jews invented and worshipped by Abram's father
            Terah, and used in the oracles of the Urim and Thummim. Moreover,
            astronomically Abraham is the sun-measure and a portion of the sun,
            while Enoch is the solar year, as much as are Hermes or Thot; and
            Thot, numerically,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“was the equivalent of Moses, or Hermes,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the lord of the lower realms, also esteemed as a teacher of
              wisdom,”</span>
            the same Mason-mathematician tells us; and the Taro being, according
            to one of the latest bulls of the Pope,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an invention of Hell,”</span> the same
            <span class="tei tei-q">“as Masonry and Occultism,”</span> the
            relation is evident. The Taro contains indeed the mystery of all
            such transmutations of personages into sidereal bodies and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>. The <span class="tei tei-q">“wheel of Enoch”</span> is an archaic

            Éliphas Lévi says there was not a nation but had it, its real
            meaning being preserved in the greatest secresy. It was a universal

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            methods of calculation, with their three sections, the Gematria,
            Notaricon and Temura, also the Albath and Algath, are extremely
            difficult to practise. We refer those who would learn more to
            Cornelius Agrippa's works.<a href="#note_178" id="noteref_178" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>
            But none of those systems can ever be understood unless a Kabalist
            becomes a real Master in his Science. The Symbolism of Pythagoras
            requires still more arduous labour. His symbols are very numerous,
            and to comprehend even the general gist of his abstruse doctrines
            from his Symbology would necessitate years of study. His chief
            figures are the square (the Tetraktys), the equilateral triangle,
            the point within a circle, the cube, the triple triangle, and
            finally the forty-seventh proposition of Euclid's Elements, of which
            proposition Pythagoras was the inventor. But with this exception,
            none of the foregoing symbols originated with him, as some believe.
            Millenniums before his day, they were well known in India, whence
            the Samian Sage brought them, not as a speculation, but as a
            demonstrated Science, says Porphyry, quoting from the Pythagorean
            Moderatus.

            The Devanâgarî characters in which Sanskrit is generally written,
            have all that the Hermetic, Chaldæan and Hebrew alphabets have, and
            in addition the Occult significance of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal sound,”</span> and the meaning
            given to every letter in its relation to spiritual as well as
            terrestrial things. As there are only twenty-two letters in the
            Hebrew alphabet and ten fundamental numbers, while in the Devanâgarî
            there are thirty-five consonants and sixteen vowels, making
            altogether fifty-one simple letters, with numberless combinations in
            addition, the margin for speculation and knowledge is in proportion
            considerably wider. Every letter has its equivalent in other
            languages, and its equivalent in a figure or figures of the
            calculation table. It has also numerous other significations, which
            depend upon the special idiosyncrasies and characteristics of the
            person, object, or subject to be studied. As the Hindus claim to
            have received the Devanâgarî characters from Sarasvatî, the
            inventress of Sanskrit, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“language of the Devas”</span> or Gods (in
            their exoteric pantheon), so most of the ancient nations claimed the
            same privilege for the origin of their letters and tongue. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg100"></a> calls the Hebrew alphabet
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“letters of the Angels,”</span> which
            were communicated to the Patriarchs, just as the Devanâgarî was to
            the Rishis by the Devas. The Chaldæans found their letters traced in
            the sky by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“yet unsettled stars and comets,”</span>
            says the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Numbers</span></span>; while the Phœnicians had a sacred alphabet formed by the
            twistings of the sacred serpents. The Natar Khari (hieratic
            alphabet) and secret (sacerdotal) speech of the Egyptians is closely
            related to the oldest
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Secret Doctrine Speech.”</span> It is a

            The power and potency of numbers and characters are well known to
            many Western Occultists as being compounded from all these systems,
            but are still unknown to Hindu students, if not to their Occultists.
            In their turn European Kabalists are generally ignorant of the
            alphabetical secrets of Indian Esoterism. At the same time the
            general reader in the West knows nothing of either; least of all how
            deep are the traces left by the Esoteric numeral systems of the

            To realise the full comprehension of the Deific and the Abstruse
            enjoyed by the Ancients, one has to study the origin of the
            figurative representations of their primitive Philosophers. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Books of Hermes</span></span>
            are the oldest repositories of numerical Symbology in Western

            is the Mother of the Soul, Life and Light being therein united. For
            as the sacred anagram Teruph shows in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the Keys</span></span>
            (Numbers), the number 1 (one) is born from Spirit, and the number 10
            (ten) from Matter;
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the unity has made the ten, the ten, the unity”</span>; and this is only the Pantheistic axiom, in other words

            The kabalistic Gematria is arithmetical, not geometrical. It is one
            of the methods for extracting the hidden meaning from letters,
            words, and sentences. It consists in applying to the letters of a
            word the sense they bear as numbers, in outward shape as well as in

            generation), the Essenes saw in it the Seal of Solomon, the Jews the
            Shield of David, the Hindus the Sign of Vishnu (to this day); and if
            even in Russia and Poland the double triangle is regarded as a
            powerful talisman—then so widespread a use argues that there is
            something in it. It stands to reason, indeed, that such an ancient
            and universally revered symbol should not be merely laid aside to be
            laughed at by those who know nothing of its virtues or real Occult
            significance. To begin with, even the known sign is merely a
            substitute for the one used by the Initiates. In a Tântrika work in
            the British Museum, a terrible curse is called down upon the head of
            him who shall ever divulge to the profane the real Occult hexagon
            known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sign of Vishnu,”</span>

            The great power of the hexagon—with its central mystic sign the T,

            We can only glance hurriedly at present at the long series of
            antediluvian works in their postdiluvian and fragmentary, often
            disfigured, form. Although all of these are the inheritance from the
            Fourth Race—now lying buried in the unfathomed depths of the
            ocean—still they are not to be rejected. As we have shown, there was
            but one Science at the dawn of mankind, and it was entirely divine.
            If humanity on reaching its adult period has abused it—especially
            the last Sub-Races of the Fourth Root-Race—it has been the fault and
            sin of the practitioners who desecrated the divine knowledge, not of
            those who remained true to its pristine dogmas. It is not because
            the modern Roman Catholic Church, faithful to her traditional
            intolerance, is now pleased to see in the Occultist, and even in the
            innocent Spiritualist and Mason, the descendants of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Kischuph, the Hamite, the Kasdim, the Cephene, the Ophite
              and the Khartumim”</span>—all these being
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the followers of Satan,”</span> that they
            are such indeed. The State or National Religion of every country has
            ever and at all times very easily disposed of rival schools by
            professing to believe they were dangerous heresies—the old Roman
            Catholic State Religion as much as the modern one.

            The anathema, however, has not made the public any the wiser in the
            Mysteries of the Occult Sciences. In some respects the world is all
            the better for such ignorance. The secrets of Nature generally cut
            both ways, and in the hands of the undeserving they are more than
            likely to become murderous. Who in our modern day knows anything of
            the real significance of, and the powers contained in, certain
            characters and signs—talismans—whether for beneficent or evil
            purposes? Fragments of the Runes and the writing of the Kischuph,
            found scattered in old mediæval libraries; copies from the Ephesian
            and Milesian letters or characters; the thrice famous
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Thoth</span></span>, and the terrible treatises (still preserved) of Targes, the
            Chaldæan, and his disciple Tarchon, the Etruscan—who flourished long
            before the Trojan War—are so many names and appellations void of
            sense (though met with in classical literature) for the educated
            modern scholar. Who,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"></a> in the nineteenth
            century, believes in the art, described in such treatises as those
            of Targes, of evoking and directing thunder-bolts? Yet the same is
            described in the Brâhmanical literature, and Targes copied his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“thunder-bolts”</span> from the Astra,<a href="#note_193" id="noteref_193" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a>
            those terrible engines of destruction known to the Mahâbhâratan
            Âryans. A whole arsenal of dynamite bombs would pale before this
            art—if it ever becomes understood by the Westerns. It is from an old
            fragment that was translated to him, that the late Lord Bulwer
            Lytton got his idea of Vril. It is a lucky thing, indeed, that, in
            the face of the virtues and philanthropy that grace our age of
            iniquitous wars, of anarchists and dynamiters, the secrets contained
            in the books discovered in Numa's tomb should have been burnt. But
            the science of Circe and Medea is not lost. One can discover it in
            the apparent gibberish of the Tântrika Sûtras, the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kuku-ma</span></span>
            of the Bhûtânî and the Sikhim Dugpas and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Red-caps”</span> of Tibet, and even in the
            sorcery of the Nîlgiri Mula Kurumbas. Very luckily few outside the
            high practitioners of the Left Path and of the Adepts of the
            Right—in whose hands the weird secrets of the real meaning are
            safe—understand the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“black”</span> evocations. Otherwise the
            Western as much as the Eastern Dugpas might make short work of their
            enemies. The name of the latter is legion, for the direct
            descendants of the antediluvian sorcerers hate all those who are not
            with them, arguing that, therefore, they are against them.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            As for the <span class="tei tei-q">“Little Albert”</span>—though
            even this small half-esoteric volume has become a literary relic—and
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Albert”</span> or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Red Dragon,”</span> together with the
            numberless old copies still in existence, the sorry remains of the
            mythical Mother Shiptons and the Merlins—we mean the false ones—all
            these are vulgarised imitations of the original works of the same
            names. Thus the <span class="tei tei-q">“Petit Albert”</span> is the
            disfigured imitation of the great work written in Latin by Bishop
            Adalbert, an Occultist of the eighth century, sentenced by the
            second Roman Concilium. His work was reprinted several centuries
            later and named
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Alberti Parvi Lucii Libellus de Mirabilibus Naturæ
                Arcanis</span></span>. The severities of the Roman Church have ever been spasmodic.
            While one learns of this condemnation, which placed the Church, as
            will be shown, in relation to the Seven Archangels, the Virtues or
            Thrones of God, in the most embarrassing position for long
            centuries, it remains a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"></a> wonder indeed, to find
            that the Jesuits have not destroyed the archives, with all their
            countless chronicles and annals, of the History of France and those
            of the Spanish Escurial, along with them. Both history and the
            chronicles of the former speak at length of the priceless talisman
            received by Charles the Great from a Pope. It was a little volume on
            Magic—or Sorcery, rather—all full of kabalistic figures, signs,
            mysterious sentences and invocations to the stars and planets. These
            were talismans against the enemies of the King (<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="fr"><span style="font-style: italic">les ennemis de Charlemagne</span></span>), which talismans, the chronicler tells us, proved of great help,
            as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“every one of them [the enemies] died a violent death.”</span>
            The small volume,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enchiridium Leonis Papæ</span></span>, has disappeared and is very luckily out of print. Again the
            Alphabet of Thoth can be dimly traced in the modern Tarot which can
            be had at almost every bookseller's in Paris. As for its being
            understood or utilised, the many fortune-tellers in Paris, who make
            a professional living by it, are sad specimens of failures of
            attempts at reading, let alone correctly interpreting, the symbolism
            of the Tarot without a preliminary philosophical study of the
            Science. The real Tarot, in its complete symbology, can be found
            only in the Babylonian cylinders, that any one can inspect and study
            in the British Museum and elsewhere. Any one can see these Chaldæan,
            antediluvian rhombs, or revolving cylinders, covered with sacred
            signs; but the secrets of these divining
            <span class="tei tei-q">“wheels,”</span> or, as de Mirville calls
            them,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the rotating globes of Hecate,”</span> have
            to be left untold for some time to come. Meanwhile there are the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“turning-tables”</span> of the modern medium
            for the babes, and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            for the strong. This may afford some consolation.

            Having disposed of pre-Christian Initiates and their
            Mysteries—though more has to be said about the latter—a few words
            must be given to the earliest post-Christian Adepts, irrespective of
            their personal beliefs and doctrines, or their subsequent places in
            History, whether sacred or profane. Our task is to analyse this
            adeptship with its abnormal thaumaturgical, or, as now called,
            psychological powers; to give each of such Adepts his due, by
            considering, firstly, what are the historical records about them
            that have reached us at this late day, and secondly, to examine the
            laws of probability with regard to the said powers.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And at the outset the writer must be allowed a few words in
            justification of what has to be said. It would be most unfair to see
            in these pages any defiance to, or disrespect for, the Christian
            religion—least of all, a desire to wound anyone's feelings. The
            Theosophist believes in neither Divine nor Satanic miracles. At such
            a distance of time he can only obtain
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ facie</span></span>
            evidence and judge of it by the results claimed. There is neither
            Saint nor Sorcerer, Prophet nor Soothsayer for him; only Adepts, or
            proficients in the production of feats of a phenomenal character, to
            be judged by their words and deeds. The only distinction he is now
            able to trace depends on the results achieved—on the evidence
            whether they were beneficent or maleficent in their character as
            affecting those for or against whom the powers of the Adept were
            used. With the division so arbitrarily made between proficients in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miraculous”</span> doings of this or that
            Religion by their respective followers and advocates, the Occultist
            cannot and
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must not</span></em>
            be concerned. The Christian whose Religion commands
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg110"></a> him to regard Peter and
            Paul as Saints, and divinely inspired and glorified Apostles, and to
            view Simon and Apollonius as Wizards and Necromancers, helped by,
            and serving the ends of, supposed Evil Powers—is quite justified in
            thus doing if he be a sincere orthodox Christian. But so also is the
            Occultist justified, if he would serve truth and only truth, in
            rejecting such a one-sided view. The student of Occultism must
            belong to no special creed or sect, yet he is bound to show outward
            respect to every creed and faith, if he would become an Adept of the
            Good Law. He must not be bound by the pre-judged and sectarian
            opinions of anyone, and he has to form his own opinions and to come
            to his own conclusions in accordance with the rules of evidence
            furnished to him by the Science to which he is devoted. Thus, if the
            Occultist is, by way of illustration, a Buddhist, then, while
            regarding Gautama Buddha as the grandest of all the Adepts that
            lived, and the incarnation of unselfish love, boundless charity, and
            moral goodness, he will regard in the same light Jesus—proclaiming
            Him another such incarnation of every divine virtue. He will
            reverence the memory of the great Martyr, even while refusing to
            recognise in Him the incarnation on earth of the One Supreme Deity,
            and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Very God of Gods”</span> in Heaven.
            He will cherish the ideal man for his personal virtues, not for the
            claims made on his behalf by fanatical dreamers of the early ages,
            or by a shrewd calculating Church and Theology. He will even believe
            in most of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“asserted miracles,”</span> only explaining
            them in accordance with the rules of his own Science and by his
            psychic discernment. Refusing them the term
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle”</span>—in the theological sense of
            an event
            <span class="tei tei-q">“contrary to the established laws of nature”</span>—he will nevertheless view them as a deviation from the laws known
            (so far) to Science, quite another thing. Moreover the Occultist
            will, on the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ facie</span></span>
            evidence of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospels</span></span>—whether proven or not—class most of such works as beneficent,
            divine Magic, though he will be justified in regarding such events
            as casting out devils into a herd of swine<a href="#note_194" id="noteref_194" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a>
            as allegorical, and as pernicious to true faith in their dead-letter
            sense. This is the view a genuine, impartial Occultist would take.
            And in this respect even the fanatical Mussulmans who regard Jesus
            of Nazareth as a great Prophet, and show respect to Him, are giving
            a wholesome lesson in charity to Christians, who teach and accept
            that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“religious tolerance is impious and absurd,”</span><a href="#note_195" id="noteref_195" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>
            and who will <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg111"></a> never refer to the
            prophet of Islam by any other term but that of a

            principles of Occultism, then, that Peter and Simon, Paul and

            What does the world at large know of Peter and Simon, for example?
            Profane history has no record of these two, while that which the
            so-called sacred literature tells us of them is scattered about,
            contained in a few sentences in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span>. As to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocrypha</span></span>, their very name forbids critics to trust to them for information.
            The Occultists, however, claim that, one-sided and prejudiced as
            they may be, the apocryphal
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospels</span></span>
            contain far more historically true events and facts than does the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament</span></span>, the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span>
            included. The former are crude tradition, the latter (the official
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospels</span></span>) are an elaborately made up legend. The sacredness of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament</span></span>
            is a question of private belief and of blind faith, and while one is
            bound to respect the private opinion of one's neighbour, no one is
            forced to share it.

            Who was Simon Magus, and what is known of him? One learns in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span>
            simply that on account of his remarkable magical Arts he was called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Great Power of God.”</span> Philip is
            said to have baptised this Samaritan; and subsequently he is accused
            of having offered money to Peter and John to teach him the power of
            working true <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles,”</span> false ones,

            This is all, if we omit the words of abuse freely used against him
            for working <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles”</span> of the latter
            kind. Origen mentions him as having visited Rome during the reign of

            but Occult tradition accuses him of nothing worse than refusing to
            recognise <span class="tei tei-q">“Simeon”</span> as a Vicegerent of
            God, whether that <span class="tei tei-q">“Simeon”</span> was Peter

            incarnated trinity; that in Samaria he was the Father, in Judæa the
            Son, and had given himself out to the Gentiles as the Holy Spirit—is
            simply backbiting. Times and events change; human nature remains the
            same and unaltered under every sky and in every age. The charge is
            the result and product of the traditional and now classical
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">odium theologicum</span></span>. No Occultists—all of whom have experienced personally, more or
            less, the effects of theological rancour—will ever believe such
            things merely on the word of an Irenæus, if, indeed, he ever wrote
            the words himself. Further on it is narrated of Simon that he took
            about with him a woman whom he introduced as Helen of Troy, who had
            passed through a hundred reincarnations, and who, still earlier, in
            the beginning of æons, was Sophia, Divine Wisdom, an emanation of
            his own (Simon's) Eternal Mind, when he (Simon) was the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span>; and finally, that by her he
            had
            <span class="tei tei-q">“begotten the Archangels and Angels, by whom this world was
              created,”</span>
            etc.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Now we all know to what a degree of transformation and luxuriant
            growth any bare statement can be subjected and forced, after passing
            through only half a dozen hands. Moreover, all these claims may be
            explained and even shown to be true at bottom. Simon Magus was a
            Kabalist and a Mystic, who, like so many other reformers,
            endeavoured to found a new Religion based on the fundamental
            teachings of the Secret Doctrine, yet without divulging more than
            necessary of its mysteries. Why then should not Simon, a Mystic,
            deeply imbued with the fact of serial incarnations (we may leave out
            the number <span class="tei tei-q">“one hundred,”</span> as a very
            probable exaggeration of his disciples), speak of any one whom he
            knew psychically as an incarnation of some heroine of that name, and
            in the way he did—if he ever did so? Do we not find in our own
            century some ladies and gentlemen, not charlatans but intellectual
            persons highly honoured in society, whose inner conviction assures
            them that they were—one Queen Cleopatra, another one Alexander the
            Great, a third Joan of Arc, and who or what not? This is a matter of
            inner conviction, and is based on more or less familiarity with
            Occultism and belief in the modern theory of reincarnation. The
            latter differs from the one genuine doctrine of old, as will be
            shown, but there is no rule without its exception.
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg114"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            As to the Magus being
            <span class="tei tei-q">“one with God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
              Ghost,”</span>
            this again is quite reasonable, if we admit that a Mystic and Seer
            has a right to use allegorical language; and in this case, moreover,
            it is quite justified by the doctrine of Universal Unity taught in
            Esoteric Philosophy. Every Occultist will say the same, on (to him)
            scientific and logical grounds, in full accordance with the doctrine
            he professes. Not a Vedântin but says the same thing daily: he is,
            of course, Brahman, and he is Parabrahman, once that he rejects the
            individuality of his personal spirit, and recognises the Divine Ray
            which dwells in his Higher Self as only a reflection of the
            Universal Spirit. This is the echo in all times and ages of the
            primitive doctrine of Emanations. The first Emanation from the
            Unknown is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> the second
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son,”</span> and all and everything
            proceeds from the One, or that Divine Spirit which is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“unknowable.”</span> Hence, the assertion
            that by her (Sophia, or Minerva, the Divine Wisdom) he (Simon), when
            yet in the bosom of the Father, himself the Father (or the first
            collective Emanation), begot the Archangels—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son”</span>—who were the creators of this
            world.

            Basilides, Carpocrates and Valentinus, the Egyptian Gnostics of the
            second century, held the same ideas with a few variations. Basilides
            preached seven Æons (Hosts or Archangels), who issued from the
            substance of the Supreme. Two of them, Power and Wisdom, begot the
            heavenly hierarchy of the first class and dignity; this emanated a
            second; the latter a third, and so on; each subsequent evolution
            being of a nature less exalted than the precedent, and each creating
            for itself a Heaven as a dwelling, the nature of each of these
            respective Heavens decreasing in splendour and purity as it
            approached nearer to the earth. Thus the number of these Dwellings
            amounted to 365; and over all presided the Supreme Unknown called
            Abraxas, a name which in the Greek method of numeration yields the
            number 365, which in its mystic and numerical meaning contains the
            number 355, or the man value.<a href="#note_202" id="noteref_202" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">202</span></span></a>

            Saturnilus of Antioch promulgated the same doctrine slightly
            modified. He taught two eternal principles, Good and Evil, which are
            simply Spirit and Matter. The seven Angels who preside over the
            seven Planets are the Builders of our Universe—a purely Eastern
            doctrine, as Saturnilus was an Asiatic Gnostic. These Angels are the
            natural Guardians of the seven Regions of our Planetary System, one
            of the most powerful among these seven creating Angels of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>
            order being <span class="tei tei-q">“Saturn,”</span> the presiding
            genius of the Planet, and the God of the Hebrew people: namely,
            Jehovah, who was venerated among the Jews, and to whom they
            dedicated the seventh day or Sabbath, Saturday—<span class="tei tei-q">“Saturn's day”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Marcion, who also held the doctrine of the two opposed principles of
            Good and Evil, asserted that there was a third Deity between the
            two—one of a <span class="tei tei-q">“mixed nature”</span>—the God
            of the Jews, the Creator (with his Host) of the lower, or our,
            World. Though ever at war with the Evil
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg116"></a> Principle, this
            intermediate Being was nevertheless also opposed to the Good
            Principle, whose place and title he coveted.

            Thus Simon was only the son of his time, a religious Reformer like
            so many others, and an Adept among the Kabalists. The Church, to
            which a belief in his actual existence and great powers is a
            necessity—in order the better to set off the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle”</span> performed by Peter and his
            triumph over Simon—extols unstintingly his wonderful magic feats. On
            the other hand, Scepticism, represented by scholars and learned
            critics, tries to make away with him altogether. Thus, after denying
            the very existence of Simon, they have finally thought fit to merge
            his individuality entirely in that of Paul. The anonymous author of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Supernatural Religion</span></span>
            assiduously endeavoured to prove that by Simon Magus we must

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistles</span></span>
            were secretly as well as openly calumniated and opposed by Peter,
            and charged with containing
            <span class="tei tei-q">“dysnoëtic learning.”</span> Indeed this
            seems more than probable when we think of the two Apostles and
            contrast their characters.

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            As shown in our earlier volumes, Simon was a pupil of the Tanaim of
            Samaria, and the reputation he left behind him, together with the
            title of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Great Power of God,”</span> testify in
            favour of the ability and learning of his Masters. But the Tanaim
            were Kabalists of the same secret school as John of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse</span></span>, whose careful aim it was to conceal as much as possible the real
            meaning of the names in the Mosaic Books. Still the calumnies so
            jealously disseminated against Simon Magus by the unknown authors
            and compilers of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span>
            and other writings, could not cripple the truth to such an extent as
            to conceal the fact that no Christian could rival him in
            thaumaturgic deeds. The story told about his falling during an
            aerial flight, breaking both his legs and then committing suicide,
            is ridiculous. Posterity has heard but one side of the story. Were
            the disciples of Simon to have a chance, we might perhaps find that
            it was Peter who broke both his legs. But as against this hypothesis
            we know that this Apostle was too prudent ever to venture himself in
            Rome. On the confession of several ecclesiastical writers, no
            Apostle ever performed such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“supernatural wonders,”</span> but of course
            pious people will say this only the more proves that it was the
            Devil who worked through Simon. He was accused of blasphemy against
            the Holy Ghost, only because he introduced as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Spiritus”</span> the Mens
            (Intelligence) or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mother of all.”</span> But we find the
            same expression used in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Enoch</span></span>, in which, in contradistinction to the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Man,”</span> he speaks of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of the Woman.”</span> In the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Codex</span></span>
            of the Nazarenes, and in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, as well as in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Books of Hermes</span></span>, the same expression is used; and even in the apocryphal
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelium of the Hebrews</span></span>
            we read that Jesus admitted the female sex of the Holy Ghost by
            using the expression
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My Mother, the Holy Pneuma.”</span>

            After long ages of denial, however, the actual existence of Simon
            Magus has been finally demonstrated, whether he was Saul, Paul or
            Simon. A manuscript speaking of him under the last name has been
            discovered in Greece and has put a stop to any further speculation.

            M. de Pressensé gives his opinion on this additional relic of early

            This MS. is very far from being complimentary to the alleged founder
            of Western Gnosticism. While recognising great powers in Simon, it
            brands him as a priest of Satan—which is quite enough to show that
            it was written by a Christian. It also shows that, like another
            <span class="tei tei-q">“servant of the Evil One”</span>—as Manes is
            called by the Church—Simon was a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">baptised</span></em>
            Christian; but that both, being too well versed in the mysteries of
            true
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primitive</span></em>
            Christianity, were persecuted for it. The secret of such persecution
            was then, as it is now, quite transparent to those who study the
            question impartially. Seeking to preserve his independence, Simon
            could not submit to the leadership or authority of any of the
            Apostles, least of all to that of either Peter or John, the
            fanatical author of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse</span></span>. Hence charges of heresy followed by
            <span class="tei tei-q">“anathema maranatha.”</span> The
            persecutions by the Church were never directed against Magic, when
            it was orthodox; for the new Theurgy, established and regulated by
            the Fathers, now known to Christendom as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“grace”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles,”</span> was, and is still, when
            it does happen, only Magic—whether conscious or unconscious. Such
            phenomena as have passed to posterity under the name of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“divine miracles”</span> were produced
            through powers acquired by great purity of life and ecstasy. Prayer
            and contemplation added to asceticism are the best means of
            discipline in order to become a Theurgist, where there is no regular
            initiation. For intense prayer for the accomplishment of some object
            is only intense
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will</span></em>
            and desire, resulting in unconscious Magic. In our own day George
            Müller of Bristol has proved it. But
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg119"></a>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“divine miracles”</span> are produced by the
            same causes that generate effects of Sorcery. The whole difference
            rests on the good or evil effects aimed at, and on the actor who
            produces them. The thunders of the Church were directed only against
            those who dissented from the formulæ and attributed to themselves
            the production of certain marvellous effects, instead of fathering
            them on a personal God; and thus, while those Adepts in Magic Arts
            who acted under her direct instructions and auspices were proclaimed
            to posterity and history as saints and friends of God, all others
            were hooted out of the Church and sentenced to eternal calumny and
            curses from their day to this. Dogma and authority have ever been
            the curse of humanity, the great extinguishers of light and truth.<a href="#note_208" id="noteref_208" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">208</span></span></a>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            It was perhaps the recognition of a germ of that which, later on, in
            the then nascent Church, grew into the virus of insatiate power and
            ambition, culminating finally in the dogma of infallibility, that
            forced Simon, and so many others, to break away from her at her very
            birth. Sects and dissensions began with the first century. While
            Paul rebukes Peter to his face, John slanders under the veil of
            vision the Nicolaitans, and makes Jesus declare that he hates
            them.<a href="#note_209" id="noteref_209" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>

            in the MS. found in Greece.

            But the latter's name is surely too famous, if one must credit the
            Church Fathers, for the historian to have mentioned him simply as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an Icarus.”</span> The writer is quite
            aware that there exists in Rome a locality named Simonium, near the
            Church of SS. Cosmas and Daimanus (Via Sacra), and the ruins of the
            ancient temple of Romulus, where the broken pieces of a stone, on
            which it is alleged the two knees of the Apostle Peter were
            impressed in thanksgiving after his supposed victory over Simon, are
            shown to this day. But what does this exhibition amount to? For the
            broken fragments of one stone, the Buddhists of Ceylon show a whole
            rock on Adam's Peak with another imprint upon it. A crag stands upon
            its platform, a terrace of which supports a huge boulder, and on the
            boulder rests for nearly three thousand years the sacred foot-print,
            of a foot five feet long. Why not credit the legend of the latter,
            if we have to accept that of St. Peter?
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Prince of Apostles,”</span> or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Prince of Reformers,”</span> or even the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“First-born of Satan,”</span> as Simon is
            called, all are entitled to legends and fictions. One may be allowed
            to discriminate, however.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            That Simon could fly,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, raise himself in the air for a few minutes, is no impossibility.
            Modern mediums have performed the same feat supported by a force
            that Spiritualists persist in calling
            <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits.”</span> But if Simon did so, it
            was with the help of a self-acquired blind power that heeds little
            the prayers and commands of rival Adepts, let alone Saints. The fact
            is that logic is against the supposed fall of Simon at the prayer of
            Peter. For had he been defeated publicly by the Apostle, his
            disciples would have abandoned him after such an evident sign of
            inferiority, and would have become orthodox Christians. But we find
            even the author of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophumena</span></span>, just such a Christian, showing otherwise. Simon had lost so
            little credit with his pupils and the masses, that he went on daily
            preaching in the Roman Campania after his supposed fall from the
            clouds <span class="tei tei-q">“far above the Capitolium,”</span> in
            which fall he broke his legs only! Such a lucky fall is in itself
            sufficiently miraculous, one would say.

            only in India, where to this day the most ancient customs and
            privileges are preserved in all their purity, notwithstanding the
            abuse levelled at the same. There is only one class of persons who
            can disregard the law of Brâhmanical institutions, caste included,
            with impunity, and that is the

            had no more to do with the foundation of the Latin Church at Rome

            Irenæus, of endowing the Church with a new name for the
            Apostle—Petra or Kiffa—a name which, by an easy play upon words,
            could be readily connected with Petroma. The Petroma was a pair of
            stone tablets used by the Hierophants at the Initiations, during the

            This word, PTR, was partially interpreted owing to another word
            similarly written in another group of hieroglyphics, on a stele, the
            glyph used for it being an opened eye, interpreted by De Rougé<a href="#note_231" id="noteref_231" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“illuminator,”</span> which is more correct.
            However it may be, the word Patar, or Peter, would locate both
            master and disciple in the circle of initiation, and connect them
            with the Secret Doctrine; while in the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seat of Peter”</span> we can hardly help
            seeing a connection with Petroma, the double set of stone tablets
            used by the Hierophant at the Supreme Initiation during the final
            Mystery, as already stated, also with the Pîtha-sthâna (seat, or the
            place of a seat), a term used in the Mysteries of the Tântriks in
            India, in which the limbs of Satî are scattered and then united
            again, as those of Osiris by Isis.<a href="#note_232" id="noteref_232" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>

            Whether all the above terms are due simply to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“coincidences”</span> or otherwise is left
            to the decision of our learned Symbologists and Philologists. We
            state facts—and nothing more. Many other writers, far
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"></a> more learned and entitled
            to be heard than the author has ever claimed to be, have
            sufficiently demonstrated that Peter never had anything to do with
            the foundation of the Latin Church; that his supposed name Petra or
            Kiffa, also the whole story of his Apostleship at Rome, are simply a
            play on the term, which meant in every country, in one or another
            form, the Hierophant or Interpreter of the Mysteries; and that
            finally, far from dying a martyr at Rome, where he had probably
            never been, he died at a good old age at Babylon. In

            passed his life in austerities and meditation, a Kabalist and a

            <span style="font-size: 173%">Section XVII. Apollonius of Tyana.</span>
          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            It is said in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>
            that the greatest teachers of divinity agree that nearly all ancient
            books were written symbolically and in a language intelligible only
            to the Initiated. The biographical sketch of Apollonius of Tyana
            affords an example. As every Kabalist knows, it embraces the whole
            of the Hermetic Philosophy, being a counterpart in many respects of
            the traditions left us of King Solomon. It reads like a fairy story,
            but, as in the case of the latter, sometimes facts and historical
            events are presented to the world under the colours of fiction. The
            journey to India represents in its every stage, though of course
            allegorically, the trials of a Neophyte, giving at the same time a
            geographical and topographical idea of a certain country as it is
            even now, if one knows where to look for it. The long discourses of
            Apollonius with the Brâhmans, their sage advice, and the dialogues
            with the Corinthian Menippus would, if interpreted, give the
            Esoteric Catechism. His visit to the empire of the wise men, his
            interview with their king Hiarchas, the oracle of Amphiaraus,
            explain symbolically many of the secret dogmas of Hermes—in the
            generic sense of the name—and of Occultism. Wonderful is this to
            relate, and were not the statement supported by numerous
            calculations already made, and the secret already half revealed, the
            writer would never have dared to say it. The travels of the great
            Magus are correctly, though allegorically described—that is to say,
            all that is related by Damis had actually taken place—but the
            narrative is based upon the Zodiacal signs. As
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transliterated</span></em>
            by Damis under the guidance of Apollonius and
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">translated</span></em>
            by Philostratus, it is a marvel indeed. At the conclusion of what
            may now be related of the wonderful Adept of Tyana our meaning will
            become clearer. Suffice it to say for the present that the dialogues
            spoken of would disclose, if correctly understood, some of the most
            important secrets of Nature. Éliphas Lévi points out the great
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg130"></a> resemblance which exists
            between King Hiarchus and the fabulous Hiram, from whom Solomon
            procured the cedars of Lebanon and the gold of Ophir. But he keeps
            silent as to another resemblance of which, as a learned Kabalist, he
            could not be ignorant. Moreover, according to his invariable custom,
            he mystifies the reader more than he teaches him, divulging nothing
            and leading him off the right track.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Like most of the historical heroes of hoary antiquity, whose lives
            and works strongly differ from those of commonplace humanity,
            Apollonius is to this day a riddle, which has, so far, found no
            Œdipus. His existence is surrounded with such a veil of mystery that
            he is often mistaken for a myth. But according to every law of logic
            and reason, it is quite clear that Apollonius should never be
            regarded in such a light. If the Tyanean Theurgist may be put down
            as a fabulous character, then history has no right to her Cæsars and
            Alexanders. It is quite true that this Sage, who stands unrivalled
            in his thaumaturgical powers to this day—on evidence historically
            attested—came into the arena of public life no one seems to know
            whence, and disappeared from it, no one seems to know whither. But
            the reasons for this are evident. Every means was used—especially
            during the fourth and fifth centuries of our era—to sweep from
            people's minds the remembrance of this great and holy man. The
            circulation of his biographies, which were many and enthusiastic,
            was prevented by the Christians, and for a very good reason, as we
            shall see. The diary of Damis survived most miraculously, and
            remained alone to tell the tale. But it must not be forgotten that
            Justin Martyr often speaks of Apollonius, and the character and
            truthfulness of this good man are unimpeachable, the more in that he
            had good reasons to feel bewildered. Nor can it be denied that there
            is hardly a Church Father of the first six centuries that left
            Apollonius unnoticed. Only, according to invariable Christian
            customs of charity, their pens were dipped as usual in the blackest
            ink of
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">odium theologicum</span></span>, intolerance and one-sidedness. St. Jerome (Hieronymus) gives at
            length the story of St. John's alleged contest with the Sage of
            Tyana—a competition of <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles”</span>—in
            which, of course, the truthful saint<a href="#note_233" id="noteref_233" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a>
            describes in glowing colours the defeat of Apollonius, and seeks
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg131"></a> corroboration in St.
            John's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocrypha</span></span>
            proclaimed doubtful
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">even</span></em>
            by the Church.<a href="#note_234" id="noteref_234" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Therefore it is that nobody can say where or when Apollonius was
            born, and everyone is equally ignorant of the date at which, and of
            the place where he died. Some think he was eighty or ninety years
            old at the time of his death, others that he was one hundred or even
            one hundred and seventeen. But, whether he ended his days at Ephesus
            in the year 96
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, as some say, or whether the event took place at Lindus in the
            temple of Pallas-Athene, or whether again he disappeared from the
            temple of Dictynna, or whether, as others maintain, he did not die
            at all, but when a hundred years old renewed his life by Magic, and
            went on working for the benefit of humanity, no one can tell. The
            Secret Records alone have noted his birth and subsequent career. But
            then—<span class="tei tei-q">“who hath believed in
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
              report?”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            All that history knows is that Apollonius was the enthusiastic
            founder of a new school of contemplation. Perhaps less metaphorical
            and more practical than Jesus, he nevertheless inculcated the same
            quintessence of spirituality, the same high moral truths. He is
            accused of having confined them to the higher classes of society
            instead of doing what Buddha and Jesus did, instead of preaching
            them to the poor and the afflicted. Of his reasons for acting in
            such an exclusive way it is impossible to judge at so late a date.
            But Karmic law seems to be mixed up with it. Born, as we are told,
            among the aristocracy, it is very likely that he desired to finish
            the work undone in this particular direction by his predecessor, and
            sought to offer
            <span class="tei tei-q">“peace on earth and good will”</span> to
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
            men, and not alone to the outcast and the criminal. Therefore he
            associated with the kings and the mighty ones of the age.
            Nevertheless, the three
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle-workers”</span> exhibited striking
            similarity of purpose. Like Jesus and like Buddha, Apollonius was
            the uncompromising enemy of all outward show of piety, all display
            of useless religious ceremonies, bigotry and hypocrisy. That his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles”</span> were more wonderful, more
            varied, and far better attested in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg132"></a> History than any others,
            is also true. Materialism denies; but evidence, and the affirmations
            of even the Church herself, however much he is branded by her, show
            this to be the fact.<a href="#note_235" id="noteref_235" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a>

                they were false. So late as eighteen centuries after his death
                he was defamed by Bishop Douglas in his work against miracles.
                In this the Right Reverend bishop crushed himself against
                historical facts. For it is not in the</span>

                have to look for a similarity between Buddha, Jesus and
                Apollonius. If we study the question with a dispassionate mind,
                we shall soon perceive that the ethics of Gautama, Plato,
                Apollonius, Jesus, Ammonius Sakkas, and his disciples, were all
                based on the same mystic philosophy—that all worshipped one
                divine Ideal, whether they considered it as the</span>
              <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Father</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
              <span style="font-size: 90%">of humanity, who lives in man, as man lives in Him, or as the
                Incomprehensible Creative Principle. All led God-like lives.
                Ammonius, speaking of his philosophy, taught that their school
                dated from the days of Hermes, who brought his wisdom from
                India. It was the same mystical contemplation throughout as that
                of the Yogin: the communion of the Brâhman with his own luminous
                Self—the</span>

            To whatever school he belonged, this fact is certain, that
            Apollonius of Tyana left an imperishable name behind him. Hundreds
            of works were written upon this wonderful man; historians have
            seriously discussed him; pretentious fools, unable to come to any
            conclusion about the Sage, have tried to deny his very existence. As
            to the Church, although she execrates his memory, she has ever tried
            to present him in the light of a historical character. Her policy
            now seems to be to direct the impression left by him into another
            channel—a well known and a very old stratagem. The Jesuits, for
            instance, while admitting his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles,”</span> have set going a double
            current of thought, and they have succeeded, as they succeed in all
            they undertake. Apollonius is represented by one party as an
            obedient
            <span class="tei tei-q">“medium of Satan,”</span> surrounding his
            theurgical powers by a most wonderful and dazzling light; while the
            other party professes to regard the whole matter as a clever
            romance, written with a predetermined object in view.

            the life of Apollonius with that of the Saviour that places the
            Church between Scylla and Charybdis. To deny the life and the

            it for having made, as the Oracles did, a series of prophecies and
            predictions wonderfully verified? No: because, better studied now,
            we

            No; for such phenomena are at the present day endemical in half

            of the presence and assistance of a spirit of whatever nature it may
            be? Or is it for having believed in transmigration (reincarnation)?
            It is still believed in (by millions) in our day. No one has any

            re-establishment of the Druidical Religion and of the Mysteries of
            Pythagoras. Or is it for having exorcised the demons and the plague?

            For having conversed with the dead? We do the same to-day, or
            believe we do so—which is all the same. For having believed in the
            Empuses? Where is the Demonologist that does not know that the

            achievements of mesmerism. For having appeared after his (supposed)
            death to the Emperor Aurelian above the city walls of Tyana, and for
            having compelled him thereby to raise the siege of that town? Such
            was the mission of every hero beyond the tomb, and the reason of the

            from it an old book preserved for years after by the Emperor Adrian
            in his Antium library? The trustworthy and sober Pausanias had
            descended into the same den before Apollonius, and came back no less
            a believer. For having disappeared at his death? Yes, like Romulus,

            apparitions, revelations, etc. Let us stop here and repeat once
            more: had the life of Apollonius been simple
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">romance</span></em>, he would never have attained such a celebrity during his lifetime
            or created such a numerous sect, one so enthusiastic after his

            or an Empress have corresponded with him. Hardly rested from the
            hardships of the siege at Jerusalem, Titus would not have hastened
            to write to Apollonius a letter, asking to meet him at Argos and
            adding that his father and himself (Titus) owed all to him, the
            great Apollonius, and that, therefore, his first thought was for
            their benefactor. Nor would the Emperor Aurelian have built a temple
            and a shrine to that great Sage, to thank him for his apparition and
            communication at Tyana. That
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">posthumous</span></em>
            conversation, as all knew, saved the city, inasmuch as Aurelian had
            in consequence raised the siege. Furthermore, had it been a romance,
            History would not have had Vopiscus,<a href="#note_250" id="noteref_250" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a>

            Finally, Apollonius would not have been the object of the admiration

            later? There must be a reason, and a very potent reason, to justify
            and explain the secret of such a strong animus of the Church against
            one of the noblest men of his age. There is a reason for it, and we
            give it in the words of the author of the

                Measures</span></span>, and of Professor Seyffarth. The latter analyses and explains the
            salient dates in the life of Jesus, and thus throws light on the
            conclusions of the former. We quote both, blending the two.

            Why then wonder at the doubts that assail every scholar who studies

            is to those who, not being Initiates, fail to find the key of the
            perfect similitude between the lives of Pythagoras, Buddha,
            Apollonius, etc.—is only a natural result for those who know that
            all these great characters were Initiates of the same School. For
            them there is neither <span class="tei tei-q">“travesty”</span> nor
            <span class="tei tei-q">“copy”</span> of one from the other; for
            them they are all <span class="tei tei-q">“originals,”</span> only
            painted to represent one and the same subject: the mystic, and at
            the same time the public, life of the Initiates sent into the world
            to save portions of humanity, if they could not save the whole bulk.
            Hence, the same programme for all. The assumed
            <span class="tei tei-q">“immaculate origin”</span> for each,
            referring to their
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mystic birth”</span> during the Mystery of
            Initiation, and accepted literally by the multitudes, encouraged in
            this by the better informed but ambitious clergy. Thus, the mother
            of each one of them was declared a virgin, conceiving her son
            directly by the Holy Spirit of God; and the Sons, in consequence,
            were the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of God,”</span> though in
            truth, none of them was any more entitled to such recognition than
            were the rest of his brother Initiates, for they were all—so far as
            their mystic lives were concerned—only
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the epitomisers of the history of the same Sun,”</span>
            which epitome is another mystery within the Mystery. The biographies
            of the external personalities bearing the names of such heroes have
            nothing to do with, and are quite independent of the private lives
            of the heroes, being only the mystic records of their public and,
            parallel therewith, of their
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner</span></em>
            lives, in their characters as
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"></a> Neophytes and Initiates.
            Hence, the manifest sameness of the means of construction of their
            respective biographies. From the beginning of Humanity the Cross, or
            Man, with his arms stretched out horizontally, typifying his kosmic
            origin, was connected with his psychic nature and with the struggles
            which lead to Initiation. But, if it is once shown that (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) every true Adept had, and still has, to pass through the seven
            and the twelve trials of Initiation, symbolised by the twelve
            labours of Hercules; (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that the day of his real birth is regarded as that day when he is
            born into the world spiritually, his very age being counted from the
            hour of his second birth, which makes of him a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“twice-born,”</span> a Dvija or Initiate, on
            which day he is indeed born of a God and from an immaculate Mother;
            and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) that the trials of all these personages are made to correspond
            with the Esoteric significance of initiatory rites—all of which
            corresponded to the twelve zodiacal signs—then every one will see
            the meaning of the travels of all those heroes through the signs of
            the Sun in Heaven; and that they are in each individual case a
            personification of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sufferings, triumphs and miracles”</span>
            of an Adept, before and after his Initiation. When to the world at
            large all this is explained, then also the mystery of all those
            lives, so closely resembling each other that the history of one
            seems to be the history of the other, and
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>, will, like everything else, become plain.

            gaze, the chief features of such lives will all be found there in

            It is not in the course of their everyday life, then, that the great

            important events of their career as religious teachers. All this is
            connected with, and built upon, an astronomical basis, which serves,
            at the same time, as a foundation for the representation of the
            degrees and trials of Initiation: descent into the Kingdom of

            Have any of our learned Orientalists ever thought of searching for

            interpretations of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>—of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>, the oldest, the most trustworthy of all the four—this root and

            for his too ardent nature, and then becomes glorified (by
            purification), that the keynote of the Initiation into the greatest
            Mystery of Nature was struck. Hence the secret of the wonderful
            <span class="tei tei-q">“similarity.”</span>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            All this is allegorical and mystical, and yet perfectly
            comprehensible and plain to any student of Eastern Occultism, even
            superficially acquainted with the Mysteries of Initiation. In our
            objective Universe of Matter and false appearances the Sun is the
            most fitting emblem of the life-giving, beneficent Deity. In the
            subjective, boundless World of Spirit and Reality the bright
            luminary has another and a mystical significance, which cannot be
            fully given to the public. The so-called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“idolatrous”</span> Pârsîs and Hindus are
            certainly nearer the truth in their religious reverence for the Sun,
            than the cold, ever-analysing, and as ever-mistaken, public is
            prepared to believe, at present. The Theosophists, who will be alone
            able to take in the meaning, may be told that the Sun is the
            external manifestation of the Seventh Principle of our Planetary
            System, while the Moon is its Fourth Principle, shining in the
            borrowed robes of her master, saturated with and reflecting every
            passionate impulse and evil desire of her grossly material body,
            Earth. The whole cycle of Adeptship and Initiation and all its
            mysteries are connected with, and subservient to, these two and the
            Seven Planets. Spiritual clairvoyance is derived from the Sun; all
            psychic states, diseases, and even lunacy, proceed from the Moon.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            According even to the data of History—her conclusions being
            remarkably erroneous while her premises are mostly correct—there is
            an extraordinary agreement between the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“legends”</span> of every Founder of a
            Religion (and also between the rites and dogmas of all) and the
            names and course of constellations headed by the Sun. It does not
            follow, however, because of this, that both Founders and their
            Religions should be, the one myths, and the other superstitions.
            They are, one and all, the different versions of the same natural
            primeval Mystery, on which the Wisdom-Religion was based, and the
            development of its Adepts subsequently framed.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And now once more we have to beg the reader not to lend an ear to
            the charge—against Theosophy in general and the writer in
            particular—of disrespect toward one of the greatest and noblest
            characters in the History of Adeptship—Jesus of Nazareth—nor even of
            hatred to the Church. The expression of truth and fact can hardly be
            regarded, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg144"></a> with any approximation to
            justice, as blasphemy or hatred. The whole question hangs upon the
            solution of that one point: Was Jesus as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Saviour”</span> of Mankind, unique in the
            World's annals? Was His case—among so many similar claims—the only
            exceptional and unprecedented one; His birth the sole supernaturally
            immaculate; and were all others, as maintained by the Church, but
            blasphemous Satanic copies and plagiarisms by anticipation? Or was
            He only the <span class="tei tei-q">“son of his deeds,”</span> a
            pre-eminently holy man, and a reformer, one of many, who paid with
            His life for the presumption of endeavouring, in the face of
            ignorance and despotic power, to enlighten mankind and make its
            burden lighter by His Ethics and Philosophy? The first necessitates
            a blind, all-resisting faith; the latter is suggested to every one
            by reason and logic. Moreover, has the Church always believed as she
            does now—or rather, as she pretends she does, in order to be thus
            justified in directing her anathema against those who disagree with
            her—or has she passed through the same throes of doubt, nay, of
            secret denial and unbelief, suppressed only by the force of ambition
            and love of power?

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The question must be answered in the affirmative as to the second
            alternative. It is an irrefutable conclusion, and a natural
            inference based on facts known from historical records. Leaving for
            the present untouched the lives of many Popes and Saints that loudly
            belied their claims to infallibility and holiness, let the reader
            turn to Ecclesiastical History, the records of the growth and
            progress of the Christian Church (not of Christianity), and he will

            were more hazy, or more difficult to define and finally agree upon
            than those of Jesus? How was the now irrevocable dogma with regard
            to His true nature settled at last? By His mother, according to the
            Evangelists, He was a man—a simple mortal man; by His Father He is
            God! But how? Is He then man or God, or is He both at the same time?
            asks the perplexed writer. Truly the propositions offered on this

            shed, in turn, on poor Humanity, and still the doubts are not at

            contradicted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg145"></a> themselves and changed

            glance at the texts offered for our inspection. This is History.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The Bishop Paul of Samosata denied the divinity of Christ at the
            first Council of Antioch; at the very origin and birth of
            theological Christianity, He was called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God”</span> merely on account of His
            holiness and good deeds. His blood was corruptible in the Sacrament
            of the Eucharist.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            At the Council of Nicæa, held
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            325, Arius came out with his premisses, which nearly broke asunder
            the Catholic Union.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Seventeen bishops defended the doctrines of Arius, who was exiled
            for them. Nevertheless, thirty years after,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            355, at the Council of Milan, three hundred bishops signed a letter
            of adherence to the Arian views, notwithstanding that ten years
            earlier,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            345, at a new Council of Antioch, the Eusebians had proclaimed that
            Jesus Christ was the Son of God and One with His Father.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            At the Council of Sirmium,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            357, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son”</span> had become no longer
            consubstantial. The Anomæans, who denied that consubstantiality, and
            the Arians were triumphant. A year later, at the second Council of
            Ancyra, it was decreed that the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son was not consubstantial but only similar to the Father in his
              substance.”</span>
            Pope Liberius ratified the decision.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            During several centuries the Councils fought and quarrelled,
            supporting the most contradictory and opposite views, the fruit of
            their laborious travail being the Holy Trinity, which, Minerva-like,
            issued forth from the theological brain, armed with all the thunders
            of the Church. The new mystery was ushered into the world amid some
            terrible strifes, in which murder and other crimes had a high hand.
            At the Council of Saragossa,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            380, it was proclaimed that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one
            and the same Person, Christ's human nature being merely an
            <span class="tei tei-q">“illusion”</span>—an echo of the Avatâric
            Hindu doctrine.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Once upon this slippery path the Fathers had to slide down
              <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ad absurdum</span></span>—which they did not fail of doing.”</span>
            How deny human nature in him who was born of a woman? The only wise
            remark made during one of the Councils of Constantinople came from
            Eutyches, who was bold enough to say:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“May God preserve me from reasoning on the nature of my
              God”</span>—for which he was excommunicated by Pope Flavius.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            At the Council of Ephesus,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            449, Eutyches had his revenge. As Eusebius, the veracious Bishop of
            Cæsarea, was forcing him into the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg146"></a> admission of
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em>
            distinct natures in Jesus Christ, the Council rebelled against him
            and it was proposed that Eusebius should be burned alive. The
            bishops arose like one man, and with fists clenched, foaming with
            rage, demanded that Eusebius should be torn into two halves, and be
            dealt by as he would deal with Jesus, whose nature he divided.
            Eutyches was re-established in his power and office, Eusebius and
            Flavius deposed. Then the two parties attacked each other most
            violently and fought. St. Flavius was so ill-treated by Bishop
            Diodorus, who assaulted and kicked him, that he died a few days
            later from the injuries inflicted.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Every incongruity was courted in these Councils, and the result is
            the present living paradoxes called Church dogmas. For instance, at
            the first Council of Ancyra,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            314, it was asked,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“In baptizing a woman with child, is the unborn baby also
              baptized by the fact?”</span>
            The Council answered in the negative; because, as was alleged,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the person thus receiving baptism must be a consenting party,
              which is impossible to the child in its mother's womb.”</span>
            Thus then unconsciousness is a canonical obstacle to baptism, and
            thus no child baptised nowadays is baptised at all in fact. And then
            what becomes of the tens of thousands of starving heathen babies
            baptised by the missionaries during famines, and otherwise
            surreptitiously <span class="tei tei-q">“saved”</span> by the too
            zealous Padres? Follow one after another the debates and decisions
            of the numberless Councils, and behold on what a jumble of
            contradictions the present infallible and Apostolic Church is built!
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And now we can see how greatly paradoxical, when taken literally, is
            the assertion in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God created man in his own image.”</span>
            Besides the glaring fact that it is not the Adam of dust (of Chapter
            ii.), who is thus made in the divine image, but the Divine Androgyne
            (of Chapter i.), or Adam Kadmon, one can see for oneself that
            God—the God of the Christians at any rate—was created by man in his
            own image, amid the kicks, blows and murders of the early Councils.

            For ten years or more, sat the revisers (?) of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, a most imposing and solemn array of the learned of the land, the
            greatest Hebrew and Greek scholars of England, purporting to correct
            the mistakes and blunders, the sins of omission and of commission of
            their less learned predecessors, the translators of the Bible. Are

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            For <span class="tei tei-q">“falsification”</span> it was. And if we
            are asked the reason why the early Church Fathers resorted to it,
            the answer is plain: Because the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sacramental</span></em>
            words belonged in their true rendering to Pagan temple
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg148"></a> rites. They were
            pronounced after the terrible trials of Initiation, and were still
            fresh in the memory of some of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fathers”</span> when the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel of Matthew</span></span>
            was edited into the Greek language. Because, finally, many of the
            Hierophants of the Mysteries, and many more of the Initiates were
            still living in those days, and the sentence rendered in its true
            words would class Jesus directly with the simple Initiates. The
            words
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My God, my Sun, thou hast poured thy radiance upon me!”</span>
            were the final words that concluded the thanksgiving prayer of the
            Initiate,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son and the glorified Elect of the Sun.”</span>
            In Egypt we find to this day carvings and paintings that represent
            the rite. The candidate is between two divine sponsors; one
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Osiris-Sun”</span> with the head of a hawk,
            representing life, the other Mercury—the ibis-headed, psychopompic
            genius, who guides the Souls after death to their new abode,
            Hades—standing for the death of the physical body, figuratively.
            Both are shown pouring the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“stream of life,”</span> the water of
            purification, on the head of the Initiate, the two streams of which,
            interlacing, form a cross. The better to conceal the truth, this
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">basso-relievo</span></span>
            has also been explained as a

            This kabalistical reading of the Gospel narratives—hitherto supposed
            to record the most important, the most mystically awful, yet most
            real events of the life of Jesus—must fall with terrible weight upon

            public life of Jesus of Nazareth, has to choose one of the two ways

            to render him quite impervious to any light coming from human
            reasoning and evident fact; or he must confess that he has lost his
            Saviour. The One whom he had hitherto considered as the unique
            incarnation on this earth of the One Living God in heaven, fades
            into thin air, on the authority of the properly read and correctly

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Host.”</span> Might is right in every age,
            and History is full of contrasts. Manes had been called the

            by his followers. He was an Occultist, but passed to posterity,
            owing to the kind exertions of the Church, as a Sorcerer, so a match
            had to be found for him by way of contrast. We recognise this match
            in St. Cyprianus of Antioch, a self-confessed if not a real
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Magician,”</span> it seems, whom the
            Church—as a reward for his contrition and humility—subsequently

            What history knows of him is not much, and it is mostly based on his
            own confession, the truthfulness of which is warranted, we are told,
            by St. Gregory, the Empress Eudoxia, Photius and the Holy Church.
            This curious document was ferreted out by the Marquis de Mirville,<a href="#note_295" id="noteref_295" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a>
            in the Vatican, and by him translated into French for the first
            time, as he assures the reader. We beg his permission to
            re-translate a few pages, not for the sake of the penitent Sorcerer,
            but for that of some students of Occultism, who will thus have an
            opportunity of comparing the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg161"></a> methods of ancient Magic
            (or as the Church calls it, Demonism) with those of modern Theurgy
            and Occultism.

            The scenes described took place at Antioch about the middle of the
            third century, 252
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, says the translator. This Confession was written by the penitent
            Sorcerer after his conversion; therefore, we are not surprised to
            find how much room he gives in his lamentations to reviling his
            Initiator <span class="tei tei-q">“Satan,”</span> or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Serpent Dragon,”</span> as he calls him.
            There are other and more modern instances of the same trait in human
            nature. Converted Hindus, Pârsîs and other
            <span class="tei tei-q">“heathen”</span> of India are apt to
            denounce their forefathers' religions at every opportunity. Thus

            Having bidden farewell to his Chaldæan Initiator, the future
            Sorcerer and Saint went to Antioch. His tale of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“iniquity”</span> and subsequent repentance
            is long but we will make it short. He became
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an accomplished Magician,”</span>
            surrounded by a host of disciples and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“candidates to the perilous and sacrilegious art.”</span>
            He shows himself distributing love-philtres and dealing in deathly
            charms
            <span class="tei tei-q">“to rid young wives of old husbands, and to ruin Christian
              virgins.”</span>
            Unfortunately Cyprianus was not above love himself. He fell in love
            with the beautiful Justine, a converted maiden, after having vainly
            tried to make her share the passion one named Aglaides, a
            profligate, had for her. His
            <span class="tei tei-q">“demons failed”</span> he tells us, and he
            got disgusted with them. This disgust brings on a quarrel between
            him and his Hierophant, whom he insists on identifying with the
            Demon; and the dispute is followed by a tournament between the
            latter and some Christian converts, in which the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Evil One”</span> is, of course, worsted.
            The Sorcerer is finally baptised and gets rid of his enemy. Having
            laid at the feet of Anthimes, Bishop of Antioch, all his books on
            Magic, he became a Saint in company with the beautiful Justine, who
            had converted him; both suffered martyrdom under the Emperor
            Diocletian; and both are buried side by side in Rome, in the
            Basilica of St. John Lateran, near the Baptistery.

            We now return to the consideration of the essential identity between
            the Eastern Gupta Vidyâ and the Kabalah as a system, while we must
            also show the dissimilarity in their philosophical interpretations
            since the Middle Ages.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            It must be confessed that the views of the Kabalists—meaning by the
            word those students of Occultism who study the Jewish
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            and who know little, if anything, of any other Esoteric literature
            or of its teachings—are as varied in their synthetic conclusions
            upon the nature of the mysteries taught even in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            alone, and are as wide of the true mark, as are the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">dicta</span></span>
            upon it of exact Science itself. Like the mediæval Rosicrucian and
            the Alchemist—like the Abbot Trithemius, John Reuchlin, Agrippa,
            Paracelsus, Robert Fludd, Philalethes, etc.—by whom they swear, the
            continental Occultists see in the Jewish
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            alone the universal well of wisdom; they find in it the secret lore
            of nearly all the mysteries of Nature—metaphysical and divine—some
            of them including herein, as did Reuchlin, those of the Christian
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>. For them the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            is an Esoteric Thesaurus of all the mysteries of the Christian
            Gospel; and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sepher Yetzirah</span></span>
            is the light that shines in every darkness, and the container of the
            keys to open every secret in Nature. Whether many of our modern
            followers of the mediæval Kabalists have an idea of the real meaning
            of the symbology of their chosen Masters is another question. Most
            of them have probably never given even a passing thought to the fact
            that the Esoteric language used by the Alchemists was their own, and
            that it was given out as a blind, necessitated by the dangers of the
            epoch they lived in, and not as the Mystery-language, used by the
            Pagan Initiates, which the Alchemists had re-translated and
            re-veiled once more.
          </p>
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg165"></a>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And now the situation stands thus: as the old Alchemists have not
            left a key to their writings, the latter have become a mystery
            within an older mystery. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            is interpreted and checked only by the light which mediæval Mystics
            have thrown upon it, and they, in their forced Christology, had to
            put a theological dogmatic mask on every ancient teaching, the
            result being that each Mystic among our modern European and American
            Kabalists interprets the old symbols in his own way, and each refers
            his opponents to the Rosicrucian and the Alchemist of three and four
            hundred years ago. Mystic Christian dogma is the central maëlstrom
            that engulfs every old Pagan symbol, and Christianity—Anti-Gnostic
            Christianity, the modern retort that has replaced the alembic of the
            Alchemists—has distilled out of all recognition the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the Hebrew
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            and other rabbinical mystic works. And now it has come to this: The
            student interested in the Secret Sciences has to believe that the
            whole cycle of the symbolical
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ancient of Days,”</span> every hair of the
            mighty beard of Macroprosopos, refers only to the history of the
            earthly career of Jesus of Nazareth! And we are told that the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“was first taught to a select company of angels”</span>
            by Jehovah himself—who, out of modesty, one must think, made himself
            only the third Sephiroth in it, and a female one into the bargain.
            So many Kabalists, so many explanations. Some believe—perchance with
            more reason than the rest—that the substance of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            is the basis upon which Masonry is built, since modern Masonry is
            undeniably the dim and hazy reflection of primeval Occult Masonry,
            of the teaching of those divine Masons who established the Mysteries
            of the prehistoric and prediluvian Temples of Initiation, raised by
            truly superhuman Builders. Others declare that the tenets expounded
            in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            relate merely to mysteries terrestrial and profane, having no more
            concern with metaphysical speculations—such as the soul, or the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">post-mortem</span></span>
            life of man—than have the Mosaic books. Others, again—and these are
            the real, genuine Kabalists, who had their instructions from
            initiated Jewish Rabbis—affirm that if the two most learned
            Kabalists of the mediæval period, John Reuchlin and Paracelsus,
            differed in their religious professions—the former being the Father
            of the Reformation and the latter a Roman Catholic, at least in
            appearance—the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            cannot contain much of Christian dogma or tenet, one way or the
            other. In other words, they maintain that the numerical language of
            the Kabalistic works teaches universal truths—and not any one
            Religion in particular. Those who make this
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg166"></a> statement are perfectly
            right in saying that the Mystery-language used in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            and in other Kabalistic literature was once, in a time of
            unfathomable antiquity, the universal language of Humanity. But they
            become entirely wrong if to this fact they add the untenable theory
            that
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this language was invented by, or was the original property of,
                the Hebrews, from whom all the other nations borrowed it</span></em>.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            They are wrong, because, although the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            (זהר ZHR),
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Book of Splendour</span></span>
            of Rabbi Simeon Ben Iochai, did indeed originate with him—his son,
            Rabbi Eleazar, helped by his secretary, Rabbi Abba, compiling the
            Kabalistic teachings of his deceased father into a work called the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>—those teachings were not Rabbi Simeon's, as the Gupta Vidyâ shows.
            They are as old as the Jewish nation itself, and far older. In
            short, the writings which pass at present under the title of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            of Rabbi Simeon are about as original as were the Egyptian
            synchronistic Tables after being handled by Eusebius, or as St.
            Paul's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistles</span></span>
            after their revision and correction by the

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Let us throw a rapid retrospective glance at the history and the
            tribulations of that very same
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, as we know of them from trustworthy tradition and documents. We
            need not stop to discuss whether it was written in the first century
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
            or in the first century
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
            Suffice it for us to know that there was at all times a Kabalistic
            literature among the Jews; that though historically it can be traced
            only from the time of the Captivity, yet from the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>
            down to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmud</span></span>
            the documents of that literature were ever written in a kind of
            Mystery-language, were, in fact, a series of symbolical records
            which the Jews had copied from the Egyptian and the Chaldæan
            Sanctuaries, only adapting them to their own national history—if
            history it can be called. Now that which we claim—and it is not
            denied even by the most prejudiced Kabalist, is that although
            Kabalistic lore had passed orally through long ages down to the
            latest Pre-Christian Tanaim, and although David and Solomon may have
            been great Adepts in it, as is claimed, yet no one dared to write it
            down till the days of Simeon
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg167"></a> Ben Iochai. In short, the
            lore found in Kabalistic literature was never recorded in writing
            before the first century of the modern era.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            This brings the critic to the following reflection: While in India
            we find the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>
            and the Brâhmanical literature written down and edited ages before
            the Christian era—the Orientalists themselves being obliged to
            concede a couple of millenniums of antiquity to the older
            manuscripts; while the most important allegories in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
            are found recorded on Babylonian tiles centuries
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>; while the Egyptian sarcophagi yearly yield proofs of the origin
            of the doctrines borrowed and copied by the Jews; yet the Monotheism
            of the Jews is exalted and thrown into the teeth of all the Pagan
            nations, and the so-called Christian Revelation is placed above all
            others, like the sun above a row of street gas-lamps. Yet it is
            perfectly well known, having been ascertained beyond doubt or cavil,
            that no manuscript, whether Kabalistic, Talmudistic, or Christian,
            which has reached our present generation, is of earlier date than
            the first centuries of our era, whereas this can certainly never be
            said of the Egyptian papyri or the Chaldæan tiles, or even of some
            Eastern writings.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            But let us limit our present research to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, and chiefly to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>—called also the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midrash</span></span>. This book, whose teachings were edited for the first time between
            70 and 110
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, is known to have been lost, and its contents to have been
            scattered throughout a number of minor manuscripts, until the
            thirteenth century. The idea that it was the composition of Moses de
            Leon of Valladolid, in Spain who passed it off as a pseudograph of
            Simeon Ben Iochai, is ridiculous and was well disposed of by
            Munk—though he does point to more than one modern interpolation in
            the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>. At the same time it is more than certain that the present
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Zohar</span></span>
            was written by Moses de Leon, and, owing to joint editorship, is
            more Christian in its colouring than is many a genuine Christian
            volume. Munk gives the reason why, saying that it appears evident
            that the author made use of ancient documents, and among these of
            certain
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Midraschim</span></span>, or collections of traditions and Biblical expositions, which we
            do not now possess.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            As a proof, also, that the knowledge of the Esoteric system taught
            in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            came to the Jews very late indeed—at any rate, that they had so far
            forgotten it that the innovations and additions made by de Leon
            provoked no criticism, but were thankfully received—Munk quotes from

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg168"></a> (and perfected) the
            theory of the Sephiroth, and he gave them names which we find again
            among the Kabalistic names used by Dr. Jellinek. Moses Ben Schem-Tob
            de Leon, who held intimate intercourse with the Syrian and Chaldæan
            Christian learned scribes, was enabled through the latter to acquire
            a knowledge of some of the Gnostic writings.<a href="#note_316" id="noteref_316" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">316</span></span></a>

            race who had received the primordial revelation from, and had
            recorded it under the orders of, a more or less divine Being. Thus
            it was with the Jews, as with all others. They had received their
            Occult Cosmogony and Laws from their Initiate, Moses, and they have
            now entirely mutilated them.

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ad-am.”</span> And such first men, in every
            nation, are credited with having been taught the divine mysteries of
            creation. Thus, the Sabæans (according to a tradition preserved in
            the Sufi works) say that when the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Third First Man”</span> left the country
            adjacent to India for Babel, a tree<a href="#note_325" id="noteref_325" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>
            was given to him, then another and a third tree, whose leaves
            recorded the history of all the races; the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Third First Man”</span> meant one who
            belonged to the Third Root-Race, and yet the Sabæans call him Adam.
            The Arabs of Upper Egypt, and the Mohammedans generally, have
            recorded a tradition that the Angel Azaz-el brings a message from
            the Wisdom-Word of God to Adam whenever he is reborn; this the Sufis
            explain by adding that this book is given to every Seli-Allah (<span class="tei tei-q">“the chosen one of God”</span>) for his wise men. The story narrated by the Kabalists—namely,
            that the book given to Adam before his Fall (a book full of
            mysteries and signs and events which either had been, were, or were
            to be) was taken away by the Angel Raziel after Adam's Fall, but
            again restored to him lest men might lose its wisdom and
            instruction; that this book was delivered by Adam to Seth, who
            passed it to Enoch, and the latter to Abraham, and so on in
            succession to the most wise of every generation—relates to all
            nations, and not to the Jews alone. For Berosus narrates in his turn
            that Xisuthrus compiled a book, writing it at the command of his
            deity, which book was buried in Zipara<a href="#note_326" id="noteref_326" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a>
            or Sippara, the City of the Sun, in Ba-bel-on-ya, and was dug up
            long afterwards and deposited in the temple of Belos; it is from
            this book that Berosus took his history of the antediluvian
            dynasties of Gods and Heroes. Ælian (in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nimrod</span></span>) speaks of a Hawk (emblem of the Sun), who in the days of the
            beginnings brought to the Egyptians a book containing the wisdom of
            their religion. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sam-Sam</span></span>
            of the Sabæans is also a
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, as is the Arabic
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zem-Zem</span></span>

            We are told by a very learned Kabalist that Seyffarth asserts that
            the old Egyptian tongue was only old Hebrew, or a Semitic dialect;
            and he proves this, our correspondent thinks, by sending him
            <span class="tei tei-q">“some 500 words in common”</span> in the two
            languages. This proves very little to our mind. It only shows that
            the two nations lived together for centuries, and that before
            adopting the Chaldæan for their phonetic
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"></a> tongue the Jews had
            adopted the old Coptic or Egyptian. The Israelitish Scriptures drew
            their hidden wisdom from the primeval Wisdom-Religion that was the
            source of other Scriptures, only it was sadly degraded by being
            applied to things and mysteries of this Earth, instead of to those
            in the higher and ever-present, though invisible, spheres. Their
            national history, if they can claim any autonomy before their return
            from the Babylonian captivity, cannot be carried back one day
            earlier than the time of Moses. The language of Abraham—if Zeruan
            (Saturn, the emblem of time—the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Saros,”</span> a

            language—was not Hebrew, but Chaldaic, perhaps Arabic, and still
            more likely some old Indian dialect. This is shown by numerous

            of the Jews has ever been an Esoteric Book in its hidden meaning,
            but this meaning has not remained one and the same throughout since
            the days of Moses. It is useless, considering the limited space we
            can give to this subject, to attempt anything like the detailed
            history of the vicissitudes of the so-called
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>, and besides, the history is too well known to need lengthy
            disquisitions. Whatever was, or was not, the Mosaic
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Creation</span></span>—from
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
            down to the Prophets—the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>
            of to-day is not the same. It is sufficient to read the criticisms
            of Erasmus, and even of Sir Isaac Newton, to see clearly that the
            Hebrew Scriptures had been tampered with and remodelled, had been
            lost and rewritten, a dozen times before the days of Ezra. This Ezra
            himself may yet one day turn out to have been Azara, the Chaldæan
            priest of the Fire and Sun-God, a renegade who, through his desire
            of becoming a ruler, and in order to create an Ethnarchy, restored
            the old lost Jewish Books in his own way. It was an
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg173"></a> easy thing for one versed
            in the secret system of Esoteric numerals, or Symbology, to put
            together events from the stray books that had been preserved by
            various tribes, and make of them an apparently harmonious narrative
            of creation and of the evolution of the Judæan race. But in its
            hidden meaning, from
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
            to the last word of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deuteronomy</span></span>, the Pentateuch is the symbolical narrative of the sexes, and is
            an apotheosis of Phallicism, under astronomical and physiological
            personations.<a href="#note_329" id="noteref_329" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
            Its coördination, however, is only apparent; and the human hand
            appears at every moment, is found everywhere in the

            before any king had reigned in Israel; Moses records his own death,
            and Aaron dies twice and is buried in two different places, to say
            nothing of other trifles. For the Kabalist they are trifles, for he
            knows that all these events are not history, but are simply the
            cloak designed to envelope and hide various physiological
            peculiarities; but for the sincere Christian, who accepts all these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“dark sayings”</span> in good faith, it
            matters a good deal. Solomon may very well be regarded as a myth<a href="#note_330" id="noteref_330" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a>

            Kabalistic and allegorical—for those few, at any rate, who
            understand them. For the Christian, however, to give up Solomon, the
            son of David—from whom Jesus is made to descend—involves a real
            loss. But how even the Kabalists can claim great antiquity for the
            Hebrew texts of the old Biblical scrolls now possessed by the
            scholars is not made at all apparent. For it is certainly a fact of
            history, based on the confessions of the Jews themselves, and of

            written under the circumstances narrated. And yet it is just these
            circumstances that are very little calculated to inspire one with
            confidence. For what does Josephus tell us? He says that Ptolemy
            Philadelphus, desiring to read the Hebrew Law in Greek, wrote to
            Eleazar, the high-priest of the Jews, begging him
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to send him six men from each of the twelve tribes</span></em>, who should make a translation for him. Then follows a truly
            miraculous story, vouchsafed by Aristeas, of these seventy-two men
            from the twelve tribes of Israel, who, shut up in an island,
            compiled their translation in exactly seventy-two days, etc.

            With regard to the claim made by some Kabalists that there was in
            antiquity one knowledge and one language, this claim is also our
            own, and it is very just. Only it must be added, to make the thing
            clear, that this knowledge and language have both been esoteric ever
            since the submersion of the Atlanteans. The Tower of Babel myth
            relates to that enforced secrecy. Men falling into sin were regarded
            as no longer trustworthy for the reception of such knowledge, and,
            from being universal, it became limited to the few. Thus, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“one-lip”</span>—or the
            Mystery-language—being gradually denied to subsequent generations,
            all the nations became severally restricted to their own national
            tongue; and forgetting the primeval Wisdom-language, they stated
            that the Lord—one of the chief Lords or Hierophants of the Mysteries
            of the Java Aleim—had confounded the languages of all the earth, so
            that the sinners could understand one another's speech no longer.
            But Initiates remained in every land and nation, and the Israelites,
            like all others, had their learned Adepts. One of the keys to this
            Universal Knowledge is a pure geometrical and numerical system, the
            alphabet of every great nation having a numerical value for every
            letter,<a href="#note_336" id="noteref_336" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a>
            and, moreover, a system of permutation of syllables and synonyms
            which is carried to perfection in the Indian Occult methods, and
            which the Hebrew certainly has not. This one system, containing the
            elements of Geometry and Numeration, was used by the Jews for the
            purpose of concealing their Esoteric creed under the mask of a
            popular and national monotheistic Religion. The last who knew the
            system to perfection were the learned and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“atheistical”</span> Sadducees, the greatest
            enemies of the pretensions of the Pharisees and of their confused
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg177"></a> notions brought from
            Babylon. Yes, the Sadducees, the Illusionists, who maintained that
            the Soul, the Angels, and all similar Beings, were illusions because
            they were temporary—thus showing themselves at one with Eastern
            Esotericism. And since they rejected every book and Scripture, with
            the exception of the Law of Moses, it seems that the latter must
            have been very different from what it is now.<a href="#note_337" id="noteref_337" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a>

            The whole of the foregoing is written with an eye to our Kabalists.
            Great scholars as some of them undoubtedly are, they are
            nevertheless wrong to hang the harps of their faith on the willows
            of Talmudic growth—on the Hebrew scrolls, whether in square or
            pointed characters, now in our public libraries, museums, or even in
            the collections of Paleographers. There do not remain half-a-dozen
            copies from the true Mosaic Hebrew scrolls in the whole world. And
            those who are in possession of these—as we indicated a few pages
            back—would not part with them, or even allow them to be examined, on
            any consideration whatever. How then can any Kabalist claim priority
            for Hebrew Esotericism, and say, as does one of our correspondents,
            that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Hebrew has come down from a far remoter antiquity than any
              of them [whether Egyptian or even Sanskrit!], and that it was the

              them”</span>?<a href="#note_338" id="noteref_338" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            As our correspondent says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“It becomes more convincing to me every day that in a far past

          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Aye, there existed indeed a mighty civilization, and a still
            mightier secret learning and knowledge, the entire scope of which
            can never be discovered by Geometry and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            alone: for there are seven keys to the large entrance-door, and not
            one, nor even two, keys can ever open it sufficiently to allow more
            than glimpses of what lies within.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Every scholar must be aware that there are two distinct styles—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two schools</span></em>, so to speak—plainly traceable in the Hebrew Scriptures: the
            Elohistic and the Jehovistic. The portions belonging to these
            respectively are so blended together, so completely mixed up by
            later hands, that often all external characteristics are lost. Yet
            it is also known that the two schools were antagonistic; that the
            one taught esoteric, the other exoteric, or theological doctrines;
            that the one, the Elohists, were Seers (Roch), whereas the other,
            the Jehovists, were prophets (Nabhi),<a href="#note_339" id="noteref_339" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a>
            and that the latter—who later became Rabbis—were generally only
            nominally prophets by virtue of their official position, as the Pope
            is called the infallible and inspired vicegerent of God. That,
            again, the Elohists meant by
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Elohim”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“forces,”</span> identifying their Deity, as
            in the Secret Doctrine, with Nature; while the Jehovists made of
            Jehovah a personal God externally, and used the term simply as a
            phallic symbol—a number of them secretly disbelieving even in
            metaphysical, abstract Nature, and synthesizing all on the
            terrestrial scale. Finally, the Elohists made of man the divine
            incarnate image of the Elohim, emanated first in all Creation; and
            the Jehovists show him as the last, the crowning glory of the animal
            creation, instead of his being the head of all the sensible beings
            on earth. (This is reversed by some Kabalists, but the reversion is
            due to the designedly-produced confusion in the texts, especially in
            the first four chapters of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>.)

            and the Brahmâ of the Brâhmans—the heavenly Androgyne, as he becomes
            the male only after separating himself into two bodies, Vâch and
            Virâj. With the Kabalists, he is at first the Jah-Havah, only later
            becoming Jehovah, like Virâj, his prototype; after separating
            himself as Adam-Kadmon into Adam and Eve in the formless, and into
            Cain-Abel in the semi-objective, world, he became finally the
            Jah-Havah, or man and woman, in Enoch, the son of Seth.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            For, the true meaning of the compound name of Jehovah—of which,
            unvoweled, you can make almost anything—is: men and women, or
            humanity composed of its two sexes. From the first chapter to the
            end of the fourth chapter of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
            every name is a permutation of another name, and every personage is
            at the same time somebody else. A Kabalist traces Jehovah from the
            Adam of earth to Seth, the third son—or rather race—of Adam.<a href="#note_348" id="noteref_348" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a>
            Thus Seth is Jehovah male; and Enos,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg182"></a> being a permutation of
            Cain and Abel, is Jehovah male and female, or our mankind. The Hindu
            Brahmâ-Virâj, Virâj-Manu, and Manu-Vaivasvata, with his daughter and
            wife, Vâch, present the greatest analogy with these personages—for
            anyone who will take the trouble of studying the subject in both the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>. It is said of Brahmâ that he created himself as Manu, and that he
            was born of, and was identical with, his original self, while he
            constituted the female portion
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Shata-rûpâ”</span> (hundred-formed). In
            this Hindu Eve,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the mother of all living beings,”</span>
            Brahmâ created Virâj, who is himself, but on a lower scale, as Cain
            is Jehovah on an inferior scale: both are the first males of the
            Third Race. The same idea is illustrated in the Hebrew name of God
            (יהוה) Read from right to left
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Jod”</span> (י) is the father,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He”</span> (ה) the mother,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Vau”</span> (ו) the son, and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He”</span> (ה), repeated at the end of the
            word, is generation, the act of birth, materiality. This is surely a
            sufficient reason why the God of the Jews and Christians should be
            personal, as much as the male Brahmâ, Vishnu, or Shiva of the
            orthodox, exoteric Hindu.

            Hence Eve stands as the evolution and the never-ceasing
            <span class="tei tei-q">“becoming”</span> of Nature. Now if we take
            the almost untranslatable Sanskrit word Sat, which means the
            quintessence of absolute immutable Being, or Be-ness—as it has been
            rendered by an able Hindu Occultist—we shall find no equivalent for
            it in any language; but it may be regarded as most closely
            resembling <span class="tei tei-q">“Ain,”</span> or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“En-Suph,”</span> Boundless Being. Then the
            term Hâyâh, <span class="tei tei-q">“to be,”</span> as passive,
            changeless, yet manifested existence may perhaps be rendered by the
            Sanskrit Jîvâtmâ, universal life or soul, in its secondary and
            cosmic meaning; while <span class="tei tei-q">“Châyâh,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“to live,”</span> as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“motion of existence,”</span> is simply
            Prâna, the ever-changing life in its objective sense. It is at the
            head of this third category that the Occultist finds Jehovah—the
            Mother, Binah, and the Father, Arelim.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg183"></a> This is made plain in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, when the emanation and evolution of the Sephiroth are explained:
            First, Ain-Suph, then Shekinah, the Garment or Veil of Infinite
            Light, then Sephira or the Kadmon, and, thus making the fourth, the
            spiritual Substance sent forth from the Infinite Light. This Sephira
            is called the Crown, Kether, and has besides, six other names—in all
            seven. These names are: 1. Kether; 2. the Aged; 3. the Primordial
            Point; 4. the White Head; 5. the Long Face; 6. the Inscrutable
            Height; and 7. Ehejeh (<span class="tei tei-q">“I am”</span>.)<a href="#note_350" id="noteref_350" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a>
            This septenary Sephira is said to contain in itself the nine
            Sephiroth. But before showing how she brought them forth, let us
            read an explanation about the Sephiroth in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmud</span></span>, which gives it as an archaic tradition, or Kabalah.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            There are three groups (or orders) of Sephiroth: 1. The Sephiroth
            called <span class="tei tei-q">“divine attributes”</span> (the Triad
            in the Holy Quaternary); 2. the sidereal (personal) Sephiroth; 3.
            the metaphysical Sephiroth, or a periphrasis of Jehovah, who are the
            first three Sephiroth (Kether, Chokmah and Binah), the rest of the
            seven being the personal
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Spirits of the Presence”</span> (also
            of the planets, therefore). Speaking of these, the angels are meant,
            though not because they are seven, but because they represent the
            seven Sephiroth which contain in them the universality of the
            Angels.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            This shows (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that, when the first four Sephiroth are separated, as a
            Triad-Quaternary—Sephira being its synthesis—there remain only seven
            Sephiroth, as there are seven Rishis; these become ten when the
            Quaternary, or the first divine Cube, is scattered into units; and
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that while Jehovah might have been viewed as the Deity, if he be
            included in the three divine groups or orders of the Sephiroth, the
            collective Elohim, or the quaternary indivisible Kether, once that
            he becomes a male God, he is no more than one of the Builders of the
            lower group—a Jewish Brahmâ.<a href="#note_351" id="noteref_351" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a>
            A demonstration is now attempted.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The first Sephira, containing the other nine, brought them forth in
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg184"></a> this order: (2) Hokmah
            (Chokmah, or Wisdom), a masculine active potency represented among
            the divine names as Jah; and, as a permutation or an evolution into
            lower forms in this instance—becoming the Auphanim (or the
            Wheels—cosmic rotation of matter) among the army, or the angelic
            hosts. From this Chokmah emanated a feminine passive potency called
            (3) Intelligence, Binah, whose divine name is Jehovah, and whose
            angelic name, among the Builders and Hosts, is
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Arelim</span></span>.<a href="#note_352" id="noteref_352" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">352</span></span></a>
            It is from the union of these two potencies, male and female (or
            Chokmah and Binah) that emanated all the other Sephiroth, the seven
            orders of the Builders. Now if we call Jehovah by his divine name,
            then he becomes at best and forthwith
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a female passive”</span> potency in Chaos.
            And if we view him as a male God, he is no more than one of many, an
            Angel, Arelim. But straining the analysis to its highest point, and
            if his male name Jah, that of Wisdom, be allowed to him, still he is
            not the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Highest and the one Living God;”</span> for
            he is contained with many others within Sephira, and Sephira herself
            is a third Potency in Occultism, though regarded as the first in the
            exoteric
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>—and is one, moreover, of lesser importance than the Vaidic Aditi,
            or the Primordial Water of Space, which becomes after many a
            permutation the Astral Light of the Kabalist.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Thus the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, as we have it now, is shown to be of the greatest importance in
            explaining the allegories and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“dark sayings”</span> of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>. As an Esoteric work upon the mysteries of creation, however, it
            is almost worthless as it is now disfigured, unless checked by the
            Chaldæan
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Numbers</span></span>
            or by the tenets of the Eastern Secret Science, or Esoteric Wisdom.
            The Western nations have neither the original
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, nor yet the Mosaic
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Finally, it is demonstrated by internal as well as by external
            evidence, on the testimony of the best European Hebraists, and the
            confessions of the learned Jewish Rabbis themselves, that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“an ancient document forms the essential basis of the

            the Kabalists of the West are only entitled to come to definite
            conclusions, when they have at hand some data at least from that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“ancient document”</span>—data
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg185"></a> now found scattered
            throughout Egyptian papyri, Assyrian tiles, and the traditions
            preserved by the descendants of the disciples of the last Nazars.
            Instead of that, most of them accept as their authorities and
            infallible guides Sabre d'Olivet—who was a man of immense erudition
            and of speculative mind, but neither a Kabalist nor an Occultist,
            either Western or Eastern—and the Mason Ragon, the greatest of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Widow's sons,”</span> who was even less of
            an Orientalist than d'Olivet, for Sanskrit learning was almost
            unknown in the days of both these eminent scholars.

            How can any Kabalist, acquainted with the foregoing, deduce his
            conclusions with regard to the true Esoteric beliefs of the
            primitive Jews, from that only which he now finds in the Jewish
            scrolls? How can any scholar—even though one of the keys to the
            universal language be now positively discovered, the true key to the
            numerical reading of a pure geometrical system—give out anything as
            his
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">final</span></em>
            conclusion? Modern Kabalistic speculation is on a par now with
            modern
            <span class="tei tei-q">“speculative Masonry;”</span> for as the
            latter tries vainly to link itself with the ancient—or rather the
            archaic—Masonry of the Temples, failing to make the link because all
            its claims have been shown to be inaccurate from an archæological
            standpoint, so fares it also with Kabalistic speculation. As no
            mystery of Nature worth running after can be revealed to humanity by
            settling whether Hiram Abif was a living Sidonian builder, or a
            solar myth, so no fresh information will be added to Occult Lore by
            the details of the exoteric privileges conferred on the Collegia
            Fabrorum by Numa Pompilius. Rather must the symbols used in it be
            studied in the Âryan light, since all the Symbolism of the ancient
            Initiations came to the West with the light of the Eastern Sun.
            Nevertheless, we find the most learned Masons and Symbologists
            declaring that all these weird symbols and glyphs, that run back to
            a common origin of immense antiquity, were nothing more than a
            display of cunning natural phallicism, or emblems of primitive
            typology. How much nearer the truth is the author of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Source of Measures</span></span>, who declares that the elements of human and numerical

            according to the newly-discovered key—may give

            contained before it had been re-composed by Esdras; then corrupted
            still more by the ambitious Rabbis in later times, and otherwise
            remodelled and interfered with? Leaving aside the opinion of the

            be sufficient to show how much now remains of the original Mosaic

            as much of it as he deemed right, and so to incorporate it with his

            This is quite sufficient, we think, to show that no key to the
            universal language-system can ever open the mysteries of Creation in
            a work in which, whether through design or carelessness, nearly
            every sentence has been made to apply to the latest outcome of
            religious views—to Phallicism, and to nothing else. There are a
            sufficient number of stray bits in the Elohistic portions of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            to warrant the inference that the Hebrews who wrote it were
            Initiates; hence the mathematical coördinations and the perfect
            harmony between the measures of the Great Pyramid and the numerals
            of the Biblical glyphs. But surely if one borrowed from the other,
            it cannot be the architects of the Pyramid who borrowed from
            Solomon's Temple, if only because the former exists to this day as a
            stupendous living monument of Esoteric records, while the famous
            temple has never existed outside of the far later Hebrew scrolls.<a href="#note_359" id="noteref_359" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a>
            Hence there is a great distance between the admission that some
            Hebrews were Initiates, and the conclusion that because of this the
            Hebrew
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            must be the best standard, as being the highest representative of
            the archaic Esoteric System.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Nowhere does the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            say, moreover, that the Hebrew is the language of God; of this
            boast, at any rate, the authors are not guilty. Perhaps because in
            the days when the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            was last edited the claim would have been too preposterous—hence
            dangerous. The
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">compilers</span></em>
            of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span>, as it exists in the Hebrew canon, knew well that the language of
            the Initiates in the days of Moses was identical with that of the
            Egyptian Hierophants; and that none of the dialects that had sprung
            from the old Syriac and the pure old Arabic of Yarab—the father and
            progenitor of the primitive Arabians, long before the time of
            Abraham, in whose days the ancient Arabic had already become
            vitiated—that none of those languages was the one sacerdotal
            universal tongue. Nevertheless all of them included a number of
            words which could be traced to common roots. And to do this is the
            business of modern Philology, though to this day, with all the
            respect due to the labours of the eminent Philologists of Oxford and
            Berlin, that Science seems to be hopelessly floundering in the
            Cimmerian darkness of mere hypothesis.

            Ahrens, when speaking of the letters as arranged in the Hebrew
            sacred scrolls, and remarking that they were musical notes, had
            probably never studied Âryan Hindu music. In the Sanskrit language
            letters are continually arranged in the sacred Ollas so that they
            may become musical notes. For the whole Sanskrit alphabet and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, from the first word to the last, are musical notations reduced to
            writing; the two are inseparable.<a href="#note_360" id="noteref_360" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a>
            As Homer distinguished between the

            so did the Hindus. The Devanâgarî, the Sanskrit characters, are the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“speech of the Gods,”</span> and Sanskrit is
            the divine language.

            It is argued in defence of the present version of the Mosaic Books
            that the mode of language adopted was an
            <span class="tei tei-q">“accommodation”</span> to the ignorance of
            the Jewish people. But the said
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mode of language”</span> drags down the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred text”</span> of Esdras and his
            colleagues to the level of the most unspiritual and gross phallic
            religions. This plea confirms the suspicions entertained by some
            Christian Mystics and many philosophical critics, that:

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord God”</span>
            than with any other Sephiroth or Number. The Ain-Suph of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
            of Moses is as independent of any relation with the created Gods as

            The division of the vault above from the Abyss, or Chaos, below is
            one of the first acts of creation or rather of evolution, in every
            cosmogony. Hermes in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pymander</span></span>
            speaks of a heaven seen in seven circles with seven Gods in them. We
            examine the Assyrian tiles and find the same on them—the seven
            creative Gods busy each in his own sphere. The cuneiform legends
            narrate how Bel prepared the seven mansions of the Gods; how heaven
            was separated from the earth. In the Brâhmanical allegory everything
            is septenary, from the seven zones, or envelopes, of the Mundane Egg
            down to the seven continents, islands, seas, etc. The six days of
            the week and the seventh, the Sabbath, are based primarily on the
            seven creations of the Hindu Brahmâ, the seventh being that of man;
            and secondarily on the number of generation. It is preëminently and
            most conspicuously phallic. In the Babylonian system the seventh
            day, or period, was that in which man and the animals were created.

                Ildabaoth signifies the Lord God of the fathers, that is the

                identical with the seven Pitris or Fathers of India (Irenæus, B.

                and nature as Phœnician divinities or powers. Sanchoniathon
                mentions them by name, and describes them as Auxiliaries of
                Kronos or Time. In this phase, then, the Elohim are time-keepers

            All this gives the key to the astronomical prototype of the allegory
            in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, but it furnishes no other key to the mystery involved in the
            sevenfold glyph. The able Egyptologist shows also that Adam himself
            according to Rabbinical and Gnostic tradition, was the chief of the
            Seven who fell from Heaven, and he connects these with the
            Patriarchs, thus agreeing with the Esoteric Teaching. For by mystic
            permutation and the mystery of primeval rebirths and adjustment, the
            Seven Rishis are in reality identical with the seven Prajâpatis, the
            fathers and creators of mankind, and also with the Kumâras, the
            first sons of Brahmâ, who refused to procreate and multiply. This
            apparent contradiction is explained by the seven-fold nature—make it
            four-fold on metaphysical principles and it will come to the same
            thing—of the celestial men, the Dhyân Chohans. This nature is made
            to divide and separate; and while the higher principles
            (Âtmâ-Buddhi) of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Creators of Men”</span> are said to be the
            Spirits of the seven constellations, their middle and lower

                inferior Seven, derived their origin from the great Mother
                alone, who produced without the fatherhood! It was in the image,
                then, of the sevenfold Elohim that the seven races were formed
                which we sometimes hear of as the Pre-Adamite races of men,

            humanity of the Mânasa Putra, Sons of Intelligence or Wisdom—reached
            every corner of the globe. The Jews, however, although they borrowed

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"></a> revelation, never had
            more than three keys out of the seven in their mind, while composing
            their national allegories—the astronomical, the numerical
            (metrology), and above all the purely anthropological, or rather
            physiological key. This resulted in the most phallic religion of
            all, and has now passed, part and parcel, into Christian theology,
            as is proved by the lengthy quotations made from a lecture of an
            able Egyptologist, who can make naught of it save astronomical myths
            and phallicism, as is implied by his explanations of

            The opening sentence in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, as every Hebrew scholar knows, is:
          </p>

            Now there are two well-known ways of rendering this line, as any
            other Hebrew writing: one exoteric, as read by the orthodox
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            interpreters (Christian), and the other Kabalistic, the latter,
            moreover, being divided into the Rabbinical and the purely
            Kabalistic or Occult method. As in Sanskrit writing, the words are
            not separated in the Hebrew, but are made to run together—especially
            in the old systems. For instance, the above, divided, would read:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">B'rashith bara Elohim eth hashamayim v'eth h'areths</span></span>;”</span>
            and it can be made to read thus:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">B'rash ithbara Elohim ethhashamayim v'eth'arets</span></span>,”</span>
            thus changing the meaning entirely. The latter means,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“In the beginning
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God made the heavens</span></em>
              and the earth,”</span>
            whereas the former, precluding the idea of any beginning, would
            simply read that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“out of the ever-existing Essence [divine] [or out of the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">womb</span></em>—also head—thereof] the dual [or androgyne] Force [Gods] shaped
              the double heaven;”</span>
            the upper and the lower heaven being generally explained as heaven
            and earth. The latter word means Esoterically the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Vehicle,”</span> as it gives the idea of an
            empty globe, within which the manifestation of the world takes
            place. Now, according to the rules of Occult symbolical reading as
            established in the old

            <span class="tei tei-q">“B'rasitb' raalaim”</span>) are in
            themselves quite sufficient to explain the theory of

            found out. A whole volume of explanations would give no more to the
            student of primitive Occult Symbology than this: the head of a bull
            within a circle, a straight horizontal line, a circle or sphere,
            then another one with three dots in it, a triangle, then the
            Svastika (or Jaina cross); after these come an equilateral triangle
            within a circle, seven small bulls' heads standing in three rows,
            one over the other; a black round dot (an opening), and then seven
            lines, meaning Chaos or Water (feminine).

            first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg201"></a> sentence and chapter in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>. By the means of number 31, or the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“El”</span> (1 for
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Aleph”</span> and 30 for
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lamedh”</span>), and other numerical
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            symbols, compared with the measures used in the great pyramid of
            Egypt, he shows the perfect identity between its
            measurements—inches, cubits, and plan—and the numerical values of
            the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, and the Patriarchs. In short, the
            author shows that the pyramid contains in itself architecturally the
            whole of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, and discloses the astronomical, and even the physiological,
            secrets in its symbols and glyphs; yet he will not admit, it would
            seem, the psycho-cosmical and spiritual mysteries involved in these.
            Nor does the author apparently see that the root of all this has to
            be sought in the archaic legends and the Pantheon of India.<a href="#note_384" id="noteref_384" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a>
            Failing this, whither does his great and admirable labour lead him?
            Not further than to find out that Adam, the earth, and Moses or
            Jehovah <span class="tei tei-q">“are the same”</span>—or to the
            a-b-c of comparative Occult Symbology—and that the days in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
            being <span class="tei tei-q">“circles”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“displayed by the Hebrews as squares,”</span>
            the result of the sixth-day's labour culminates in the fructifying
            principle. Thus the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
            is made to yield Phallicism, and that alone.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Nor—read in this light, and as its Hebrew texts are interpreted by
            Western scholars—can it ever yield anything higher or more sublime
            than such phallic elements, the root and the corner-stone of its
            dead-letter meaning. Anthropomorphism and Revelation dig the
            impassable chasm between the material world and the ultimate
            spiritual truths. That creation is not thus described in the
            Esoteric Doctrine is easily shown. The Roman Catholics give a
            reading far more approaching the true Esoteric meaning than that of
            the Protestant. For several of their saints and doctors admit that
            the formation of heaven and earth, of the celestial bodies, etc.,
            belongs to the work of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Angels of the Presence.”</span> St.
            Denys calls the <span class="tei tei-q">“Builders”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the coöperators of God,”</span> and St.
            Augustine goes even farther, and credits the Angels with the
            possession of the divine thought, the prototype, as he says, of
            everything created.<a href="#note_385" id="noteref_385" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a>
            And, finally, St. Thomas Aquinas has a long
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"></a> dissertation upon this
            topic, calling God the primary, and the Angels the secondary, cause
            of all visible effects. In this, with some dogmatic differences of
            form, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Angelic Doctor”</span> approaches
            very nearly the Gnostic ideas. Basilides speaks of the lowest order
            of Angels as the Builders of our material world, and Saturnilus
            held, as did the Sabæans, that the Seven Angels who preside over the
            planets are the real creators of the world; the Kabalist-monk,
            Trithemius, in his
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Secundis Deis</span></span>, taught the same.

            The eternal
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Kosmos</span></span>, the Macrocosm, is divided in the Secret Doctrine, like man, the
            Microcosm, into three Principles and four Vehicles,<a href="#note_386" id="noteref_386" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a>
            which in their collectivity are the seven Principles. In the
            Chaldæan or Jewish
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, the Kosmos is divided into seven worlds: the Original, the
            Intelligible, the Celestial, the Elementary, the Lesser (Astral),
            the Infernal (Kâma-loka or Hades), and the Temporal (of man). In the
            Chaldæan system it is in the Intelligible World, the second, that
            appear the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Angels of the Presence,”</span> or
            the Sephiroth (the three higher ones being, in fact, one, and also
            the sum total of all). They are also the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Builders”</span> of the Eastern Doctrine:
            and it is only in the third, the celestial world, that the seven
            planets and our solar system are built by the seven Planetary
            Angels, the planets becoming their visible bodies. Hence—as
            correctly stated—if the universe as a whole is formed out of the
            Eternal
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></em>
            Substance or Essence, it is not that everlasting Essence, the
            Absolute Deity, that builds it into shape; this is done by the first
            Rays, the Angels or Dhyân Chohans, that emanate from the One
            Element, which becoming periodically Light and Darkness, remains
            eternally, in its Root-Principle, the one unknown yet existing
            Reality.

            Attention must here be called to the confusion—if not worse—which
            reigns in the Western interpretations of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>. The Eternal
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></em>
            is said to conform himself into two: the Great Father and Mother of
            Nature. To begin with, it is a horribly anthropomorphic conception
            to apply terms implying sexual distinction to the earliest and first
            differentiations of the One. And it is even more erroneous to
            identify these first differentiations—the Purusha and Prakriti of
            Indian Philosophy—with the Elohim, the creative powers here spoken
            of; and to ascribe to these (to our intellects) unimaginable
            abstractions, the formation and construction of this visible world,
            full of pain, sin, and sorrow. In truth, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“creation by the Elohim”</span> spoken of
            here is but a much later
            <span class="tei tei-q">“creation,”</span> and the Elohim far from
            being supreme, or even exalted powers in Nature, are only lower
            Angels. This was the teaching of the Gnostics, the most
            philosophical of all the early Christian Churches. They taught that
            the imperfections of the world were due to the imperfection of its
            Architects or Builders—the imperfect, and therefore inferior,
            Angels. The Hebrew Elohim correspond to the Prajâpati of the Hindus,
            and it is shown elsewhere from the Esoteric interpretation of the
            Purânas that the Prajâpati were the fashioners of man's material and
            astral form
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>: that they could not give him intelligence or reason, and
            therefore in symbolical language they
            <span class="tei tei-q">“failed to create man.”</span> But, not to
            repeat what the reader can find elsewhere in this work, his
            attention needs only to be called to the fact that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“creation”</span> in this passage is not the
            Primary Creation, and that the Elohim are not

            All this, however, teaches us very little as to the true functions
            of this celestial army, and nothing at all as to its place in
            evolution and its relation to the earth we live on. For an answer to
            the question,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Who are the true Creators?”</span> we must
            go to the Esoteric Doctrine, since there only can the key be found
            which will render intelligible the Theogonies of the various
            world-religions.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            There we find that the real creator of the Kosmos, as of all visible
            Nature—if not of all the invisible hosts of Spirits not yet drawn
            into the <span class="tei tei-q">“Cycle of Necessity,”</span> or
            evolution—is <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord—the Gods,”</span> or

            The One is infinite and unconditioned. It cannot create, for It can
            have no relation to the finite and conditioned. If everything we
            see, from the glorious suns and planets down to the blades of grass
            and the specks of dust, had been created by the Absolute Perfection
            and were the direct work of even the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>
            Energy that proceeded from It,<a href="#note_389" id="noteref_389" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a>
            then every such thing would have been perfect, eternal, and
            unconditioned, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg209"></a> like its author. The
            millions upon millions of imperfect works found in Nature testify
            loudly that they are the products of finite, conditioned
            beings—though the latter were and are Dhyân Chohans, Archangels, or
            what ever else they may be named. In short, these imperfect works
            are the unfinished production of evolution, under the guidance of
            the imperfect Gods. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            gives us this assurance as well as the Secret Doctrine. It speaks of
            the auxiliaries of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ancient of Days,”</span> the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Aged,”</span> and calls them

            and Unconditioned, nor even Its reflection, that creates, but only
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Gods”</span> who fashion the
            Universe out of the eternal Matter, vivified into objective life by

            of all the older cosmogonies—are all to be found in his writings,

            Therein, too, may be recognized the Depths of Ahriman, Rector of

            Kabalistic Metatron; and they can easily be identified again in the
            Roman Catholic writers when read in the original Greek and Latin
            texts, English translations giving but a very poor idea of the real
            contents of these.

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, an unfathomable store of hidden wisdom and mystery, is very often
            appealed to by Roman Catholic writers. A very learned Rabbi, now the
            Chevalier Drach, having been converted to Roman Catholicism, and
            being a great Hebraist, thought fit to step into the shoes of Picus
            de Mirandola and John Reuchlin, and to assure his new
            co-religionists that the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            contained in it pretty nearly all the dogmas of Catholicism. It is
            not our province to show here how far he has succeeded or failed;
            only to bring one instance of his explanations and preface it with
            the following:
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, as already shown, is not a genuine production of the Hebrew mind.
            It is the repository and compendium of the oldest doctrines of the
            East, transmitted orally at first, and then written down in
            independent treatises during the Captivity at Babylon, and finally
            brought together by Rabbi Simeon Ben Iochai, toward the beginning of
            the Christian era. As Mosaic cosmogony was born under a new form in
            Mesopotamian countries, so the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            was a vehicle in which were focussed rays from the light of
            Universal Wisdom. Whatever likenesses are found between it and the
            Christian teachings, the compilers of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            never had Christ in their minds. Were it otherwise there would not
            be one single Jew of the Mosaic law left in the world by this time.
            Again, if one is to accept literally what the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            says, then any religion under the sun may find corroboration in its
            symbols and allegorical sayings; and this, simply because this work
            is the echo of the primitive truths, and every creed is founded on
            some of these; the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            being but a veil of the Secret Doctrine. This is so evident that we
            have only to point to the said ex-Rabbi, the Chevalier Drach, to
            prove the fact.

            If behind the physical luminary there were no mystery that people
            sensed instinctively, why should every nation, from the primitive
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"></a> peoples down to the
            Parsîs of to-day, have turned towards the Sun during prayers? The
            Solar Trinity is not Mazdean, but is universal, and is as old as
            man. All the temples in Antiquity were invariably made to face the
            Sun, their portals to open to the East. See the old temples of
            Memphis and Baalbec, the Pyramids of the Old and of the New (?)
            Worlds, the Round Towers of Ireland, and the Serapeum of Egypt. The
            Initiates alone could give a philosophical explanation of this, and
            a reason for it—its mysticism notwithstanding—were only the world
            ready to receive it, which alas! it is not. The last of the Solar
            Priests in Europe was the Imperial Initiate, Julian, now called the
            Apostate.<a href="#note_398" id="noteref_398" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a>
            He tried to benefit the world by revealing at least a portion of the
            great mystery of the τρεπλασιος and—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he died</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“There are three in one,”</span> he said
            of the Sun—the central Sun<a href="#note_399" id="noteref_399" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a>
            being a precaution of Nature: the first is the universal cause of
            all, Sovereign Good and perfection; the Second Power is paramount
            Intelligence, having dominion over all reasonable beings, νοεροῖς;
            the third is the visible Sun. The pure energy of solar intelligence
            proceeds from the luminous seat occupied by our Sun in the centre of
            heaven, that pure energy being the Logos of our system; the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mysterious Word Spirit produces all through the Sun, and never
              operates through any other medium,”</span>
            says Hermes Trismegistus. For it is
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>
            the Sun, more than in any other heavenly body that the [unknown]
            Power placed the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg214"></a> seat of its habitation.
            Only neither Hermes Trismegistus nor Julian (an initiated
            Occultist), nor any other, meant by this Unknown Cause Jehovah, or
            Jupiter. They referred to the cause that produced all the manifested
            <span class="tei tei-q">“great Gods”</span> or Demiurgi (the Hebrew
            God included) of our system. Nor was our visible,
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em>
            Sun meant, for the latter was only the manifested symbol. Philolaus
            the Pythagorean, explains and completes Trismegistus by saying:

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style="               margin-right: 3.6em;               margin-left: 3.6em;               margin-top: 1.8em;               margin-bottom: 1.8em;             ">

          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            It is evident that Philolaus referred to the central spiritual Sun,
            whose beams and effulgence are only mirrored by our central Star,
            the Sun. This is as clear to the Occultists as it was to the
            Pythagoreans. As for the profane of pagan antiquity, it was, of
            course, the physical Sun that was the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“highest God”</span> for them, as it
            seems—if Chevalier Drach's view be accepted—to have now virtually
            become for the modern Roman Catholics. If words mean anything, the
            statement made by the Chevalier Drach that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“this sun is, undeniably, the second hypostasis of the
              Deity,”</span>
            imply what we say; as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“this Sun”</span> refers to the Kabalistic
            Sun, and <span class="tei tei-q">“hypostasis”</span> means substance
            or subsistence of the Godhead or Trinity—distinctly personal. As the
            author, being an ex-Rabbi, thoroughly versed in Hebrew, and in the
            mysteries of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, ought to know the value of words; and as, moreover, in writing
            this, he was bent upon reconciling
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the seeming contradictions,”</span> as he
            puts it, between Judaism and Christianity—the fact becomes quite
            evident.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            But all this pertains to questions and problems which will be solved
            naturally and in the course of the development of the doctrine. The
            Roman Catholic Church stands accused, not of worshipping under other
            names the Divine Beings worshipped by all nations in antiquity, but
            of declaring idolatrous, not only the Pagans ancient and modern, but
            every Christian nation that has freed itself from the Roman yoke.
            The accusation brought against herself by more than one man of
            Science, of worshipping the stars like true Sabæans of old, stands
            to this day uncontradicted, yet no star-worshipper has ever
            addressed his adoration to the material stars and planets, as will
            be shown before the last page of this work is written; none the less
            is it true that those Philosophers alone who studied Astrology and
            Magic knew that the last word of those sciences was to be sought in,
            and expected from, the Occult forces emanating from those
            constellations.

            intelligent ruling and guiding Forces is so much felt to this day
            that scientific men and specialists, who will not hear of Occultism
            or of ancient systems, find themselves obliged to generate in their
            inner consciousness some kind of semi-mystical system. Metcalf's
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sun-force”</span> theory, and that of
            Zaliwsky, a learned Pole, which made Electricity the Universal Force

            was present in the physical constitution of the Sun and explained
            its peculiarities. This is very near the Occult teaching. It is only

            and it is so dim and hazy when seen through the best telescope that
            it looks like an astronomical romance to call it one of our planets.
            Neptune's heat and light are reduced to 1/900 part of the heat and
            light received by the earth. His motion and that of his satellites
            have always looked suspicious. They do not agree—in appearance, at
            least—with those of the other planets. His system is retrograde,
            etc. But even the latter abnormal fact resulted only in the creation
            of new hypotheses by our Astronomers, who forthwith suggested a
            probable overturn of Neptune, his collision with another body, etc.
            Was Adams' and Leverrier's discovery so welcomed because Neptune was
            as necessary as was Ether to throw a new glory upon astronomical
            prevision, upon the certitude of modern scientific data, and
            principally upon the power of mathematical analysis? It would so
            appear. A new planet that widens our planetary domain by more than
            four hundred million leagues is worthy of annexation. Yet, as in the
            case of terrestrial annexation, scientific authority may be proved
            <span class="tei tei-q">“right”</span> only because it has
            <span class="tei tei-q">“might.”</span> Neptune's motion happens to
            be dimly perceived: Eureka! it is a planet! A mere motion, however,
            proves very little. It is now an ascertained fact in Astronomy that
            there are no absolutely fixed stars in Nature,<a href="#note_408" id="noteref_408" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a>

            astronomical parlance, while they have passed from the scientific
            imagination. Occultism, however, has a strange theory of its own

            taught by eminent men of learning—are taken away from the Science of
            Modern Astronomy, to which they serve as props, then even the
            presumably universal law of gravitation will be found to be contrary

            scientific some of these may themselves be, for refusing to quarrel
            with their Church for the sake of scientific beliefs. Nor can we

            mechanism were perfect; but it is not. The so-called unalterable
            motions of celestial bodies alter and change incessantly; they are
            very often disturbed, and the wheels of even the sidereal locomotive
            itself occasionally jump off their invisible rails, as may be easily
            proved. Otherwise why should Laplace speak of the probable
            occurrence at some future time of an out-and-out reform in the
            arrangement of the planets;<a href="#note_409" id="noteref_409" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a>
            or Lagrange maintain the gradual narrowing of the orbits; or our
            modern Astronomers, again, declare that the fuel in the sun is
            slowly disappearing? If the laws and forces which govern the
            behaviour of the celestial bodies are immutable, such modifications
            and wearing-out of substance or fuel, of force and fluids, would be
            impossible; yet they are not denied. Therefore
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg220"></a> one has to suppose that
            such modifications will have to rely upon the laws of forces, which
            will have to self-regenerate themselves once more on such occasions,
            thus producing an astral antinomy, and a kind of physical palinomy,
            since, as Laplace says, one would then see fluids disobeying
            themselves and reäcting in a way contrary to all their attributes
            and properties.

            Newton felt very uncomfortable about the moon. Her behaviour in
            progressively narrowing the circumference of her orbit around the
            earth made him nervous, lest it should end one day in our satellite
            falling upon the earth. The world, he confessed, needed repairing,
            and that very often.<a href="#note_410" id="noteref_410" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a>

            He speaks of real and quite considerable deviations, besides those
            which are only apparent, but gets some consolation from his
            conviction that somebody or something will probably see to things.

            We may be answered that the personal beliefs of some pious
            Astronomers, however great they may be as scientific characters, are
            no proofs of the actual existence and presence in space of
            intelligent supramundane Beings, of either Gods or Angels. It is the
            behaviour of the stars and planets themselves that has to be
            analysed and inferences must be drawn therefrom. Renan asserts that
            nothing that we know of the sidereal bodies warrants the idea of the
            presence of any Intelligence, whether internal or external to them.

            All this is very ingenious, but is very puzzling, besides being
            incorrect. For owing to the first sentence,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Above the dark abyss were the Waters,”</span>
            the French Kabalist leads the student away from the right track.
            This an Eastern Chela will see at a glance, and even one of the
            profane may see it. For if the Tohu-vah-bohu is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“under”</span> and the Waters are
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"></a>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“above,”</span> then these two are quite
            distinct from each other, and this is not the case. This statement
            is a very important one, inasmuch as it entirely changes the spirit
            and nature of Cosmogony, and brings it down to a level with exoteric
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>—perhaps it was so stated with an eye to this result. The
            Tohu-vah-bohu is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Deep”</span> and
            is identical with
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Waters of Chaos,”</span> or the
            primordial Darkness. By stating the fact otherwise it makes both
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Great Deep”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters”</span>—which cannot be separated
            except in the phenomenal world—limited as to space and conditioned
            as to their nature. Thus Éliphas in his desire to conceal the last
            word of Esoteric Philosophy, fails—whether intentionally or
            otherwise does not matter—to point out the fundamental principle of
            the one true Occult Philosophy, namely, the unity and absolute
            homogeneity of the One Eternal Divine Element, and he makes of the
            Deity a male God. Then he says:

            through whose radiance manifests the Eternal Thought concealed in

            to reverse the order in which Éliphas Lévi gives it, replacing the
            word <span class="tei tei-q">“above”</span> by that of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“in,”</span> as there cannot surely be any

            and from this the first Prajâpati, the Lord of Beings, emerges, and
            becomes the progenitor of mankind. And though it is not he, but the
            Absolute, that is said to contain the Universe in Itself, yet it is
            the duty of the male Brahmâ to manifest it in a visible form. Hence
            he has to be connected with the procreation of species, and assumes,
            like Jehovah and other male Gods in subsequent anthropomorphism, a
            phallic symbol. At best every such male God, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span> of all, becomes the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Archetypal Man.”</span> Between him and the
            Infinite Deity stretches an abyss. In the theistic religions of
            personal Gods the latter are degraded from abstract Forces into
            physical potencies. The Water of Life—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Deep”</span> of Mother Nature—is viewed in
            its terrestrial aspect in anthropomorphic religions. Behold, how
            holy it has become by theological magic! It is held sacred and is
            deified now as of old in almost every religion. But if Christians
            use it as a means of spiritual purification in baptism and prayer;
            if Hindus pay reverence to their sacred streams, tanks, and rivers;
            if Pârsî, Mahommedan and Christian alike believe in its efficacy,
            surely that element must have some great and Occult significance. In
            Occultism it stands for the Fifth Principle of Kosmos, in the lower
            septenary: for the whole visible Universe was built by Water, say

            common object: that of procreation. The earth needs solar heat and
            rain to make her throw out her germs. But these procreative
            properties of Fire and Water, or Spirit and Matter, are symbols but
            of physical generation. While the Jewish Kabalists symbolized these
            elements only in their application to manifested things, and
            reverenced them as the emblems for the production of terrestrial
            life, the Eastern Philosophy noticed them only as an illusive
            emanation from their spiritual prototypes, and no unclean or unholy
            thought marred its Esoteric religious symbology.

            This historical fact, furnished by one of the ablest and most
            erudite among the Jesuits, is unfortunate for the prestige of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord God of Israel”</span> with regard to
            his claims to priority and to his being the

            living God. Jehovah, on the admission of the

            itself, conversed with his elect in no other way, and this places
            him on a par with every other Pagan God, even of the inferior
            classes. In
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Judges</span></span>, xvii., we read of Micah having an ephod and a teraphim
            fabricated, and consecrating them to Jehovah (see the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Septuagint</span></span>
            and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vulgate</span></span>); these objects were made by a founder from the two hundred
            shekels of silver given to him by his mother. True, King James'

            of idolatry by saying:

            <span class="tei tei-q">“the holy instruments of primitive revelations;”</span>

            and delivering to her several prophecies? And if this be not
            sufficient, there is Saul, who deplores the silence of the ephod,<a href="#note_446" id="noteref_446" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a>

            The thummim and urim, however—the object in our days of so much

            it originated with them, despite the minute instruction given about
            it by Jehovah to Moses. For the priest-hierophant of the Egyptian
            temples wore a breastplate of precious stones, in every way similar
            to that of the high priest of the Israelites.

            and sectarianism. Seldenus is right, however, in arguing that in the

            established for purposes of divine and angelic communications only.

            kind of theophanic, or divine communication; for no Bath-Kol (or

            called thummim, could be heard whether by Jew, Pagan, or Christian,
            were there not a fit tabernacle for it. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“tabernacle”</span> was simply the archaic
            telephone of those days of Magic when Occult powers were acquired by

            Most decidedly—and it is not the Theosophists who will ever deny the

            malevolent <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods”</span> in all ages. The
            whole trouble was, and still is, to know which is which. And this,
            we maintain, the Christian Church knows no more than her profane
            flock. If anything proves this, it is, most decidedly, the
            numberless theological blunders made in this direction. It is idle

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Few of our students of Occultism have had the opportunity of
            examining Egyptian papyri—those living, or rather re-arisen
            witnesses that Magic, good and bad, was practised many thousands of
            years back into the night of time. The use of the papyrus prevailed
            up to the eighth century of our era, when it was given up, and its
            fabrication fell into disuse. The most curious of the exhumed
            documents were immediately purchased and taken away from the
            country. Yet there are a number of beautifully-preserved papyri at
            Bulak, Cairo, though the greater number have never been yet properly
            read.<a href="#note_453" id="noteref_453" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a>

            Others—those that have been carried away and may be found in the
            museums and public libraries of Europe—have fared no better. In the
            days of the Vicomte de Rougé, some twenty-five years ago, only a few
            of them
            <span class="tei tei-q">“were two-thirds deciphered;”</span> and
            among those some most interesting legends, inserted parenthetically
            and for purposes of explaining royal expenses, are in the Register
            of the Sacred Accounts.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            This may be verified in the so-called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Harris”</span> and Anastasi collections,
            and in some papyri recently exhumed; one of these gives an account
            of a whole series of magic feats performed before the Pharaohs
            Ramses II. and III. A curious document, the first-mentioned, truly.
            It is a papyrus of the fifteenth century
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, written during the reign of Ramses V., the last king of the
            eighteenth dynasty, and is the work of the scribe Thoutmes, who
            notes down some of the events with
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"></a> regard to defaulters
            occurring on the twelfth and thirteenth days of the month of Paophs.
            The document shows that in those days of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles”</span> in Egypt the taxpayers
            were not found among the living alone, but every mummy was included.
            All and everything was taxed; and the Khou of the mummy, in default,
            was punished
            <span class="tei tei-q">“by the priest-exorciser, who deprived it of the liberty of
              action.”</span>
            Now what was the Khou? Simply the astral body, or the aerial
            simulacrum of the corpse or the mummy—that which in China is called
            the Hauen, and in India the Bhût.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Upon reading this papyrus to-day, an Orientalist is pretty sure to
            fling it aside in disgust, attributing the whole affair to the crass
            superstition of the ancients. Truly phenomenal and inexplicable must
            have been the dullness and credulity of that otherwise highly
            philosophical and civilized nation if it could carry on for so many
            consecutive ages, for thousands of years, such a system of mutual
            deception! A system whereby the people were deceived by the priests,
            the priests by their King-Hierophants, and the latter themselves
            were cheated by the ghosts, which were, in their turn, but
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the fruits of hallucination.”</span> The
            whole of antiquity, from Menes to Cleopatra, from Manu to
            Vikramaditya, from Orpheus down to the last Roman augur, were
            hysterical, we are told. This must have been so, if the whole were
            not a system of fraud. Life and death were guided by, and were under
            the sway of, sacred <span class="tei tei-q">“conjuring.”</span> For
            there is hardly a papyrus, though it be a simple document of
            purchase and sale, a deed belonging to daily transactions of the
            most ordinary kind, that has not Magic, white or black, mixed up in
            it. It looks as though the sacred scribes of the Nile had purposely,
            and in a prophetic spirit of race-hatred, carried out the (to them)
            most unprofitable task of deceiving and puzzling the generations of
            a future white race of unbelievers yet unborn! Anyhow, the papyri
            are full of Magic, as are likewise the stelæ. We learn, moreover,
            that the papyrus was not merely a smooth-surfaced parchment, a

            The papyrus of the priest Nevo-loo (or Nevolen), at the Louvre, may
            be selected for one case. First of all there is the bark carrying
            the coffin, a black chest containing the defunct's mummy. His
            mother, Ammenbem-Heb, and his sister, Hooissanoob, are near; at the
            head and feet of the corpse stand Nephtys and Isis clothed in red,
            and near them a priest of Osiris clad in his panther's skin, his
            censer in his right hand, and four assistants carrying the mummy's
            intestines. The coffin is received by the God Anubis (of the
            jackal's head), from the hands of female weepers. Then the Soul
            rises from its mummy and the Khou (astral body) of the defunct. The
            former begins its worship of the four genii of the East, of the
            sacred birds, and of Ammon as a ram. Brought into the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Palace of Truth,”</span>
            the defunct is before his judges. While the Soul, a scarabæus,
            stands in the presence of Osiris, his astral Khou is at the door.
            Much laughter is provoked in the West by the invocations to various
            Deities, presiding over each of the limbs of the mummy, and of the
            living human body. Only judge: in the papyrus of the mummy
            Petamenoph
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the anatomy becomes theographical,”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“geese, eggs, and pork”</span> had not some
            other Occult meaning. The Indian Yogî who, in an
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exoteric</span></em>
            work, is invited to drink a certain intoxicating liquor till he
            loses his senses, was also regarded as a drunkard representing his
            sect and class, until it was found that the Esoteric sense of that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> was quite different: that it
            meant divine light, and stood for the ambrosia of Secret Wisdom. The
            symbols of the dove and the lamb which abound now in Eastern and
            Western Christian Churches may also be exhumed long ages hence, and
            speculated upon as objects of present-day worship. And then some
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Occidentalist”</span> in the forthcoming
            ages of high Asiatic civilization and learning, may write karmically
            upon the same as follows:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The ignorant and superstitious Gnostics and Agnostics of the
              sects of <span class="tei tei-q">‘Pope’</span> and
              <span class="tei tei-q">‘Calvin’</span> (the two monster Gods of
              the Dynamite-Christian period) adored a pigeon and a sheep!”</span>
            There will be portable hand-fetishes in all and every age for the
            satisfaction and reverence of the rabble, and the Gods of one race
            will always be degraded into devils by the next one. The cycles
            revolve within the depths of Lethe, and Karma shall reach Europe as
            it has Asia and her religions.

            a whole poem to him who can read it correctly and interpret the
            images therein. In that picture we see Osiris, the horned, with his
            sceptre hooked at the end—the original of the pastoral bishop's
            crook or crosier—the Soul hovering above, encouraged by Tmei,
            daughter of the Sun of Righteousness and Goddess of Mercy and
            Justice; Horus and Anubis, weighing the deeds of the soul. One of
            these papyri shows the Soul found guilty of gluttony sentenced to be
            re-born on earth as a hog; forthwith comes the learned conclusion of

            Again, a simple suggestion may throw on this a great light. Are the
            Orientalists quite sure they have read correctly the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“metempsychosis during 3,000 years”</span>?
            The Occult Doctrine teaches that Karma waits at the threshold of
            Devachan (the Amenti of the Egyptians) for 3,000 years; that then
            the eternal
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em>
            is reincarnated
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">de novo</span></span>, to be punished in its new temporary personality for sins
            committed in the preceding birth, and the suffering for which, in
            one shape or another, will atone for past misdeeds. And the hawk,
            the lotus-flower, the heron, serpent, or bird—every object in
            Nature, in short—had its symbolical and manifold meaning in ancient
            religious emblems. The man who all his life acted hypocritically and
            passed for a good man, but had been in sober reality watching like a
            bird of prey his chance to pounce upon his fellow-creatures, and had
            deprived them of their property, will be sentenced by Karma to bear
            the punishment for hypocrisy and covetousness in a future life. What
            will it be? Since every human unit has ultimately to progress in its
            evolution, and since that <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> will
            be reborn at some future time as a good, sincere, well-meaning man,
            his sentence to be re-incarnated as a hawk may simply mean that he
            will then be regarded metaphorically as such. That, notwithstanding
            his real, good, intrinsic qualities, he will, perhaps during a long
            life, be unjustly and falsely charged with and suspected of greed
            and hypocrisy and of secret exactions, all of which will make him
            suffer more than he can bear. The law of retribution can never err,
            and yet how many such innocent victims of false appearance and human
            malice do we not meet in this world of incessant illusion, of
            mistake and deliberate wickedness. We see them
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg247"></a> every day, and they may
            be found within the personal experience of each of us. What
            Orientalist can say with any degree of assurance that he has
            understood the religions of old? The metaphorical language of the
            priests has never been more than superficially revealed, and the
            hieroglyphics have been very poorly mastered to this day.<a href="#note_459" id="noteref_459" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>

                architecture of the pyramids shows in itself the drift of the
                metaphysical thought of their builders. The apex is lost in the
                clear blue sky of the land of the Pharaohs, and typifies the
                primordial point lost in the unseen Universe from whence started
                the first race of the spiritual prototypes of man. Each mummy
                from the moment that it was embalmed lost its physical
                individuality in one sense: it symbolised the human race. Placed

                before it made its exit through the symbolical apex. Each
                chamber typified, at the same time, one of the seven spheres [of
                our Chain] and one of the seven higher types of
                physico-spiritual humanity alleged to be above our own. Every
                3000 years the soul, representative of its race, had to return
                to its primal point of departure before it underwent another
                evolution into a more perfected spiritual and physical
                transformation. We must go deep indeed into the abstruse
                metaphysics of Oriental mysticism before we can realise fully

            exorcisms against the Black Art. Therein Osiris is the conqueror of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“aerial demons.”</span> The worshipper

            In studying Egyptian papyri, one begins to find that the subjects of
            the Pharaohs were not very much inclined to the Spiritism or
            Spiritualism of their day. They dreaded the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“blessed spirit”</span> of the dead more
            than a Roman Catholic dreads the devil!

            exercising their magic powers with the help of

            more than one papyrus. For one often finds in them records of
            Sorcerers sentenced to the death penalty, as though they had been
            living under the protection of the holy Christian Inquisition. Here

            Evidently Khons-peiri-Seklerem-Zam was a real Hierophant of the
            class named the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of God,”</span> since
            he is said to be one of the forms of the God Khons; which means
            either that he was considered as an incarnation of that God—an
            Avatâra—or that he was a full Initiate. The same text shows that the
            temple to which he belonged was one of those to which a School of
            Magic was attached. There was a Khen in it, or that portion of the
            temple which was inaccessible to all but the highest priest, the
            library or depository of secret works, to the study and care of
            which special priests were appointed (those whom all the Pharaohs
            consulted in cases of great importance), and wherein they
            communicated with the Gods and obtained advice from them. Does not
            Lucian tell his readers in his description of the temple of
            Hierapolis, of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods who manifest their presence independently?”</span><a href="#note_471" id="noteref_471" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a>
            And further on that he once travelled with a priest from Memphis,
            who told him he had passed twenty-three years in the subterranean
            crypts of his temple, receiving instructions on Magic from the
            Goddess Isis herself. Again we read that it was by Mercury himself
            that the great Sesostris (Ramses II.) was instructed in the Sacred
            Sciences. On which Jablonsky remarks that we have here the reason
            why Amun (Ammon)—whence he thinks our

            Excesses of power, abuse of knowledge and personal ambition very
            often led selfish and unscrupulous Initiates to black Magic, just as
            the same causes led to precisely the same thing among Christian
            popes and cardinals; and it was black Magic that led finally to the
            abolition of the Mysteries, and not Christianity, as is often
            erroneously thought. Read Mommsen's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Roman History</span></span>, vol. i., and you will find that it was the Pagans themselves who
            put an end to the desecration of the Divine Science. As early as 560

            the Romans had discovered an Occult association, a school of black
            Magic of the most revolting kind; it celebrated mysteries brought

            All that is, of course, derided Magic, the outcome of primitive
            knowledge and of revelation, though it was practised in such ungodly
            ways by the Atlantean Sorcerers that it has since become necessary
            for the subsequent Race to draw a thick veil over the practices
            which were used to obtain so-called magical effects on the psychic
            and on the physical planes. In the letter no one in our century will
            believe the statements, with the exception of the Roman Catholics,
            and these will give the acts a satanic origin. Nevertheless, Magic
            is so mixed up with the history of the world, that if the latter is
            ever to be written it has to rely upon the discoveries of
            Archæology, Egyptology, and hieratic writings and inscriptions; if
            it insists that they must be free from that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition of the ages”</span> it will
            never see the light. One can well imagine the embarrassing position
            in which serious Egyptologists, Assyriologists, savants and
            academicians find themselves. Forced to translate and interpret the
            old papyri and the archaic inscriptions on stelæ and Babylonian
            cylinders, they find themselves compelled from first to last to face
            the distasteful, and to them repulsive, subject of Magic, with its
            incantations and paraphernalia. Here they find sober and grave
            narratives from the pens of learned scribes, made up under the
            direct supervision of Chaldæan or Egyptian Hierophants, the most
            learned among the Philosophers of antiquity. These statements were
            written at the solemn hour of the death and burial of Pharaohs, High
            Priests, and other mighty ones of the land of Chemi; their purpose
            was the introduction of the newly-born, Osirified Soul before the
            awful-tribunal of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Judge”</span> in the region of
            Amenti—there where a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lie</span></em>
            was said to outweigh the greatest crimes. Were the Scribes and
            Hierophants, Pharaohs, and King-Priests all fools or frauds to have
            either believed in, or tried to make others believe in, such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“cock-and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a> bull stories”</span>
            as are found in the most respectable papyri? Yet there is no help
            for it. Corroborated by Plato and Herodotus, by Manetho and
            Syncellus, as by all the greatest and most trustworthy authors and
            philosophers who wrote upon the subject, those papyri note down—as
            seriously as they note any history, or any fact so well known and
            accepted as to need no commentary—whole royal dynasties of Manes, to
            wit, of shadows and phantoms (astral bodies), and such feats of
            magic skill and such Occult phenomena, that the most credulous
            Occultist of our own times would hesitate to believe them to be
            true.

            appearance of those institutions is a matter of historical tradition
            with regard to some of the later nations, their origin must
            certainly be assigned to the time of the Fourth Root Race. The
            Mysteries were imparted to the elect of that Race when the average
            Atlantean had begun to fall too deeply into sin to be trusted with
            the secrets of Nature. Their establishment is attributed in the
            Secret Works to the King-Initiates of the divine dynasties, when the

            The antiquity of the Mysteries may be inferred from the history of

            Raivata, a grandson of Sharyâti, Manu's fourth son, finding no man
            worthy of his lovely daughter, repaired with her to Brahmâ's region
            to consult the God in this emergency. Upon his arrival, Hâhâ Hûhû,
            and other Gandharvas were singing before the throne, and Raivata,
            waiting till they had done, imagined that but one Muhûrta (instant)
            had passed, whereas long ages had elapsed. When they had finished
            Raivata prostrated himself and explained his perplexity. Then Brahmâ
            asked him whom he wished for a son-in-law, and upon hearing a few
            personages named, the Father of the World smiled and said:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Of those whom you have named the third and fourth generation
              [Root-Races] no longer survive, for many successions of ages
              [Chatur-Yuga, or the four Yuga cycles] have passed away while you
              were listening to our songsters. Now on earth the twenty-eighth
              great age of the present Manu is nearly finished and the Kali
              period is at hand. You must therefore bestow this virgin-gem upon

            capital, which was now called Dvârakâ, and where reigned in his
            stead a portion of the divine being (Vishnu) in the person of
            Baladeva, the brother of Krishna, regarded as the seventh
            incarnation of Vishnu whenever Krishna is taken as a full divinity.

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of the Flame”</span> and other orders
            of Dhyân Chohans in the heroes and kings of mankind, down to the
            Kali Yuga, or Black Age, the beginning of which is within historical
            times. Another
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coincidence</span></em>: Thebes is the city of a hundred gates, and Dvârakâ is so called
            from its many gateways or doors, from the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dvâra,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gateway.”</span> Both Hercules and Baladeva
            are of a passionate, hot temper, and both are renowned for the
            fairness of their white skins. There is not the slightest doubt that
            Hercules is Baladeva in Greek dress. Arrian notices the great
            similarity between the Theban and the Hindu Hercules, the latter
            being worshipped by the Suraseni who built Methorea, or Mathûrâ,
            Krishna's birthplace. The same writer places Sandracottus
            (Chandragupta, the grandfather of King Asoka, of the clan of Morya)
            in the direct line of the descendants of Baladeva.

            There were no Mysteries in the beginning, we are taught. Knowledge
            (Vidyâ) was common property, and it reigned universally throughout
            the Golden Age (Satya Yuga). As says the Commentary:
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Men had not created evil yet in those days of bliss and purity,

            But when mankind, rapidly increasing in numbers, increased also in
            variety of idiosyncrasies of body and mind, then incarnated Spirit
            showed its weakness. Natural exaggerations, and along with these
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg261"></a> superstitions, arose in
            the less cultured and healthy minds. Selfishness was born out of
            desires and passions hitherto unknown, and but too often knowledge
            and power were abused, until finally it became necessary to limit
            the number of those
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who knew</span></em>. Thus arose Initiation.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Every separate nation now arranged for itself a religious system,
            according to its enlightenment and spiritual wants. Worship of mere
            form being discarded by the wise men, these confined true knowledge
            to the very few. The need of veiling truth to protect it from
            desecration becoming more apparent with every generation, a thin
            veil was used at first, which had to be gradually thickened
            according to the spread of personality and selfishness, and this led
            to the Mysteries. They came to be established in every country and
            among every people, while to avoid strife and misunderstanding
            exoteric beliefs were allowed to grow up in the minds of the profane
            masses. Inoffensive and innocent in their incipient stage—like a
            historical event arranged in the form of a fairy tale, adapted for
            and comprehensible to the child's mind—in those distant ages such
            beliefs could be allowed to grow and make the popular faith without
            any danger to the more philosophical and abstruse truths taught in
            the sanctuaries. Logical and scientific observation of the phenomena
            in Nature, which alone leads man to the knowledge of eternal
            truths—provided he approaches the threshold of observation unbiassed
            by preconception and sees with his spiritual eye before he looks at
            things from their physical aspect—does not lie within the province
            of the masses. The marvels of the One Spirit of Truth, the
            ever-concealed and inaccessible Deity, can be unravelled and
            assimilated only through Its manifestations by the secondary
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> Its acting powers. While the
            One and Universal Cause has to remain for ever
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">in abscondito</span></span>, Its manifold action may be traced through the effects in Nature.
            The latter alone being comprehensible and manifest to average
            mankind, the Powers causing those effects were allowed to grow in
            the imagination of the populace. Ages later in the Fifth, the Âryan,
            Race some unscrupulous priests began to take advantage of the
            too-easy beliefs of the people in every country, and finally raised
            those secondary Powers to the rank of God and Gods, thus succeeding
            in isolating them altogether from the One Universal Cause of all
            causes.<a href="#note_489" id="noteref_489" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a>

            Or rather, the Initiates whom the Masons have never ceased to claim

            and priestcraft, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) to become educated men, free from every danger of being enslaved

            This, in view of the preceding, may seem paradoxical. The Initiates
            were <span class="tei tei-q">“priests,”</span> we may be told—at any
            rate, all the Hindu, Egyptian, Chaldæan, Greek, Phœnician, and other
            Hierophants and Adepts were priests in the temples, and it was they
            who invented their respective exoteric creeds. To this the answer is
            possible:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The cowl does not make the friar.”</span>
            If one may believe tradition and the unanimous opinion of ancient
            writers, added to the examples we have in the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“priests”</span> of India, the most
            conservative nation in the world, it becomes quite certain that the
            Egyptian priests were no more priests in the sense we give to the
            word than are the temple Brâhmans. They could never be regarded as
            such if we take as our standard the European clergy. Laurens

            The Egyptian Priests, like the Brâhmans of old, held the reins of
            the governing powers, a system that descended to them by direct
            inheritance from the Initiates of the great Atlantis. The pure cult
            of Nature in the earliest patriarchal days—the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“patriarch”</span> applying in its first
            original sense to the Progenitors of the human race,<a href="#note_494" id="noteref_494" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a>
            the Fathers, Chiefs, and Instructors of primitive men—became the

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg264"></a> alone who could discern
            the noumenon beneath the phenomenon. Later, the Initiates
            transmitted their knowledge to the human kings, as their divine
            Masters had passed it to their forefathers. It was their prerogative
            and duty to reveal the secrets of Nature that were useful to
            mankind—the hidden virtues of plants, the art of healing the sick,
            and of bringing about brotherly love and mutual help among mankind.
            No Initiate was one if he could not heal—aye, recall to life from
            apparent death (coma) those who, too long neglected, would have
            indeed died during their lethargy.<a href="#note_495" id="noteref_495" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a>
            Those who showed such powers were forthwith set above the crowds,
            and were regarded as Kings and Initiates. Gautama Buddha was a
            King-Initiate, a healer, and recalled to life those who were in the
            hands of death. Jesus and Apollonius were healers, and were both
            addressed as Kings by their followers. Had they failed to raise
            those who were to all intents and purposes the dead, none of their
            names would have passed down to posterity; for this was the first
            and crucial test, the certain sign that the Adept had upon Him the
            invisible hand of a primordial divine Master, or was an incarnation
            of one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods.”</span>
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The later royal privilege descended to our Fifth Race kings through
            the kings of Egypt. The latter were all initiated into the mysteries
            of medicine, and they healed the sick, even when, owing to the
            terrible trials and labours of final Initiation, they were unable to
            become full Hierophants. They were healers by privilege and by
            tradition, and were assisted in the healing art by the Hierophants
            of the temples, when they themselves were ignorant of Occult
            curative Science. So also in far later historical times we find
            Pyrrhus curing the sick by simply touching them with his foot;
            Vespasian and Hadrian needed only to pronounce a few words taught to
            them by their Hierophants, in order to restore sight to the blind
            and health to the cripple. From that time onward history has
            recorded cases of the same privilege conferred on the emperors and
            kings of almost every nation.<a href="#note_496" id="noteref_496" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a>

            Priests in every department of Science, unless they had it from a
            still more ancient source? The famous
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Four,”</span> the seats of learning in old
            Egypt, are more historically certain than the beginnings of modern
            England. It was in the great Theban sanctuary that Pythagoras upon
            his arrival from India studied the Science of Occult numbers. It was
            in Memphis that Orpheus popularized his too-abstruse Indian
            metaphysics for the use of Magna Grecia; and thence Thales, and ages
            later Democritus, obtained all they knew. It is to Saïs that all the
            honour must be given of the wonderful legislation and the art of
            ruling people, imparted by its Priests to Lycurgus and Solon, who
            will both remain objects of admiration for generations to come. And
            had Plato and Eudoxus never gone to worship at the shrine of
            Heliopolis, most probably the one would have never astonished future
            generations with his ethics, nor the other with his wonderful
            knowledge of mathematics.<a href="#note_497" id="noteref_497" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">497</span></span></a>

            Initiation, though it contained neither rules and principles, nor
            any special teaching of Science—as now understood—was nevertheless
            Science, and the Science of sciences. And though devoid of dogma, of
            physical discipline, and of exclusive ritual, it was yet the one
            true Religion—that of eternal truth. Outwardly it was a school, a
            college, wherein were taught sciences, arts, ethics, legislation,
            philanthropy, the cult of the true and real nature of cosmic
            phenomena; secretly, during the Mysteries, practical proofs of the
            latter were given. Those who could learn truth on all things—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, those who could look the great Isis in her unveiled face and bear
            the awful majesty of the Goddess—became Initiates. But the children
            of the Fifth Race had fallen too deeply into matter always to do so
            with impunity. Those who failed disappeared from the world, without
            leaving a trace behind. Which of the highest kings would have dared
            to claim any individual, however high his social standing, from the
            stern priests, once that the victim had crossed the threshold of
            their sacred Adytum?

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The noble precepts taught by the Initiates of the early races passed
            to India, Egypt, and Greece, to China and Chaldæa, and thus spread
            all over the world. All that is good, noble, and grand in human
            nature, every divine faculty and aspiration, were cultured by the
            Priest-Philosophers who sought to develop them in their Initiates.
            Their code of ethics, based on altruism, has become universal. It is
            found in Confucius, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“atheist,”</span> who taught that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“he who loves not his brother has no virtue in him,”</span>
            and in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span>

                There, too, in his own breast, he has discovered a power that is
                never mute when he prays, never absent when he fears and

            This Self, the highest, the one, and the universal, was symbolised
            on the plane of mortals by the Sun, its life-giving effulgence being
            in its turn the emblem of the Soul—killing the terrestrial passions
            which have ever been an impediment to the re-union of the Unit Self
            (the Spirit) with the All-Self. Hence the allegorical mystery, only
            the broad features of which may be given here. It was enacted by the

            when the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun”</span> became Vikarttana,
            shorn of his beams or rays. After that, the Sun—enacted by a
            neophyte ready to be initiated—was made to descend into Pâtâla, the
            nether regions, on a trial of Tantalus. Coming out of it triumphant,
            he emerged from this region of lust and iniquity, to re-become

            as the Graha-Râjah, King of the Constellations, and was addressed as

            [Of the true Mysteries, the real Initiations, nothing of course can
            be said in public; they can be known only to those who are able to
            experience them. But a few hints can be given of the great
            ceremonial Mysteries of Antiquity, which stood to the public as the
            real Mysteries, and into which candidates were initiated with much
            ceremony and display of Occult Arts. Behind these, in silence and
            darkness, were the true Mysteries, as they have always existed and
            continue to exist. In Egypt, as in Chaldæa and later in Greece, the
            Mysteries were celebrated at stated times, and the first day was a
            public holiday, on which, with much pomp, the candidates were
            escorted to the Great Pyramid and passed thereinto out of sight. The
            second day was devoted to ceremonies of purification, at the close
            of which the candidate was presented with a white robe; on the third
            day]<a href="#note_508" id="noteref_508" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">508</span></span></a>
            he was tried and examined as to his proficiency in Occult learning.
            On the fourth day, after another ceremony symbolical of
            purification, he was sent alone to pass through various trials,
            finally becoming entranced in a subterranean crypt, in utter
            darkness, for two days and two nights. In Egypt, the entranced
            neophyte was placed in an empty sarcophagus in the Pyramid, where
            the initiatory rites took place. In India and Central Asia, he was
            bound on a lathe, and when his body had become like that of one dead
            (entranced), he was carried into the crypt. Then the Hierophant kept
            watch over him
            <span class="tei tei-q">“guiding the apparitional soul (astral body) from this world of

            origin of the Mysteries. Ragon, the famous Mason, gives curious
            details and explanations with regard to the Sun rites. He shows that
            the biblical Hiram, the great hero of Masonry (the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“widow's son”</span>) a type taken from
            Osiris, is the Sun-God, the inventor of arts, and the

            the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elevated</span></em>, a title belonging to the Sun. Every Occultist knows how closely
            related to Osiris and the Pyramids are the narratives in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kings</span></span>
            concerning Solomon, his Temple and its construction; he knows also
            that the whole of the Masonic rite of Initiation is based upon the
            Biblical allegory of the construction of that Temple, Masons
            conveniently forgetting, or perhaps ignoring, the fact that the
            latter narrative is modelled upon Egyptian and still earlier
            symbolisms. Ragon explains it by showing that the three companions
            of Hiram, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“three murderers,”</span> typify the three
            last months of the year; and that Hiram stands for the Sun—from its
            summer solstice downwards, when it begins decreasing—the whole rite
            being an astronomical allegory.

            This Brotherhood does possess a considerable portion of the
            symbolism, formulæ, and ritual of Occultism, handed down from time
            immemorial from the primeval Initiations. To render this Brotherhood
            a mere harmless negation, the Jesuits sent some of their most able
            emissaries into the Order, who first made the simple brethren
            believe that the true secret was lost with Hiram Abiff; and then
            induced them to put this belief into their formularies. They then
            invented specious but spurious higher degrees, pretending to give
            further light upon this lost secret, to lead the candidate on and
            amuse him with forms borrowed from the real thing but containing no
            substance, and all artfully contrived to lead the aspiring Neophyte
            to nowhere. And yet men of good sense and abilities, in other
            respects, will meet at intervals, and with solemn face, zeal and
            earnestness, go through the mockery of revealing

                days of the unseen—a dread, as recent events and phenomena show
                very clearly, not yet overcome in its entirety. Hence students
                of Nature and mind were forced into an obscurity not altogether
                unwelcome.... The Kabalistic reveries of a Johann Reuchlin led
                to the fiery action of a Luther, and the patient labours of
                Trittenheim produced the modern system of diplomatic cipher

                of these efforts at throwing off the trammels of the past
                [Popery and Ecclesiasticism] occurred. Hence the opposition of
                the losing party, and their virulence against anything
                mysterious or unknown. They freely organised pseudo-Rosicrucian
                and Masonic societies in return; and these societies were
                instructed to irregularly entrap the weaker brethren of the True

            Vishvakarma and Sûrya Vikarttana has survived, where Hiram Abiff was
            indeed murdered, and we will now return to it. It is not simply an
            astronomical, but is the most solemn rite, an inheritance from the
            Archaic Mysteries that has crossed the ages and is used to this day.
            It typifies a whole drama of the Cycle of Life, of progressive
            incarnations, and of psychic as well as of physiological secrets, of
            which neither the Church nor Science knows anything, though it is

            The antiquity of the Secret Doctrine may be better realised when it
            is shown at what point of history its Mysteries had already been
            desecrated, by being made subservient to the personal ambition of
            despot-ruler and crafty priest. These profoundly philosophical and
            scientifically composed religious dramas, in which were enacted the
            grandest truths of the Occult or Spiritual Universe and the hidden
            lore of learning, had become subject to persecution long before the
            days when Plato and even Pythagoras flourished. Withal, primal
            revelations given to Mankind have not died with the Mysteries; they
            are still preserved as heirlooms for future and more spiritual
            generations.

            that so far back as in the days of Aristotle, the great Mysteries
            had already lost their primitive grandeur and solemnity. Their rites
            had fallen into desuetude, and they had to a great degree
            degenerated into mere priestly speculations and had become religious
            shams. It is useless to state when they first appeared in Europe and
            Greece, since recognised history may almost be said to begin with
            Aristotle, everything before him appearing to be in an inextricable
            chronological confusion. Suffice it to say, that in Egypt the
            Mysteries had been known since the days of Menes, and that the
            Greeks received them only when Orpheus introduced them from India.
            In an article
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Was writing known before Pânini?”</span><a href="#note_512" id="noteref_512" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a>
            it is stated that the Pândus had acquired universal dominion and had
            taught the <span class="tei tei-q">“sacrificial”</span> Mysteries to
            other races as far back as 3,300
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
            Indeed, when Orpheus, the son of Apollo or Helios, received from his
            father the phorminx—the seven-stringed lyre, symbolical of the
            sevenfold mystery
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg278"></a> of Initiation—these
            Mysteries were already hoary with age in Central Asia and India.
            According to Herodotus it was Orpheus who brought them from India,
            and Orpheus is far anterior to Homer and Hesiod. Thus even in the
            days of Aristotle few were the true Adepts left in Europe and even
            in Egypt. The heirs of those who had been dispersed by the
            conquering swords of various invaders of old Egypt had been
            dispersed in their turn. As 8,000 or 9,000 years earlier the stream
            of knowledge had been slowly running down from the tablelands of
            Central Asia into India and towards Europe and Northern Africa, so
            about 500 years
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
            it had begun to flow backward to its old home and birthplace. During
            the two thousand subsequent years the knowledge of the existence of
            great Adepts nearly died out in Europe. Nevertheless, in some secret
            places the Mysteries were still enacted in all their primitive
            purity. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun of Righteousness”</span> still blazed
            high on
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the midnight sky</span></em>; and, while darkness was upon the face of the profane world, there
            was the eternal light in the Adyta on the nights of Initiation. The
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>
            Mysteries were never made public. Eleusinia and Agræ for the

            Occultists have nothing against it. Only, in such case, Jehovah is

            Christian Fathers. Clement Alexandrinus stigmatises the Mysteries as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“indecent and diabolical”</span> though his
            words, showing that the Eleusinian Mysteries were identical with,
            and even, as he would allege, borrowed from, those of the Jews, are
            quoted elsewhere in this work. The Mysteries were composed of two
            parts, of which the Lesser were performed
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg282"></a> at Agræ, and the Greater
            at Eleusis, and Clement had been himself initiated. But the
            Katharsis, or trials of purification, have ever been misunderstood.
            Iamblichus explains the worst; and his explanation ought to be
            perfectly satisfactory, at any rate for every unprejudiced mind.

            Masonic Initiation was modelled on that in the lesser Mysteries. The
            third degree was one used in both Egypt and India from time
            immemorial, and the remembrance of it lingers to this day in every
            Lodge, under the name of the death and resurrection of Hiram Abiff,
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Widow's Son.”</span> In Egypt the
            latter was called <span class="tei tei-q">“Osiris;”</span> in India

            ind <span class="tei tei-q">“Dinakara”</span> (day-maker) or the
            Sun—and the rite itself was everywhere named the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gate of death.”</span> The coffin, or
            sarcophagus, of Osiris, killed by Typhon, was brought in and placed
            in the middle of the Hall of the Dead, with the Initiates all around
            it and the candidate near by. The latter was asked whether he had
            participated in the murder, and notwithstanding his denial, and
            after sundry and very hard trials, the Initiator feigned to strike
            him on the head with a hatchet; he was thrown down, swathed in
            bandages like a mummy, and wept over. Then came lightning and
            thunder, the supposed corpse was surrounded with fire, and was

              <span style="font-size: 90%">In all times, the Sun has necessarily played an important part
                as a symbol, and especially in Freemasonry. The W.M. represents
                the rising sun, the J.W. the sun at the meridian, and the S.W.
                the setting sun. In the Druidical rites, the Arch-Druid
                represented the sun, and was aided by two other officers, one
                representing the Moon in the West, and the other the Sun at the
                South in its meridian. It is quite unnecessary to enter into any
                lengthened discussion on this symbol.</span>

          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            It is the more <span class="tei tei-q">“unnecessary”</span> since J.
            M. Ragon has discussed it very fully, as one may find at the end of
            Section XXIX., where part of his explanations have been quoted.
            Freemasonry derived her rites from the East, as we have said. And if
            it be true to say of the modern Rosicrucians that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“they are invested with a knowledge of chaos, not perhaps a very
              desirable acquisition,”</span>
            the remark is still more true when applied to all the other branches
            of Masonry, since the knowledge of their members about the full
            signification of their symbols is
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nil</span></span>. Dozens of hypotheses are resorted to, one more unlikely than the
            other, as to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Round Towers”</span> of
            Ireland; one fact is enough to show the ignorance of the Masons,
            namely, that, according to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal Masonic Cyclopædia</span></span>, the idea that they are connected with Masonic Initiation may be
            at once dismissed as unworthy of notice. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Towers,”</span> which are found throughout
            the East in Asia, were connected with the Mystery-Initiations,
            namely, with the Vishvakarma and the Vikarttana rites. The
            candidates for Initiation were placed in them for three days and
            three nights, wherever there was no temple with a subterranean crypt
            close at hand. These round towers were built for no other purposes.
            Discredited as are all such monuments of Pagan origin by the
            Christian clergy, who thus
            <span class="tei tei-q">“soil their own nest,”</span> they are still
            the living and indestructible relics of the Wisdom of old.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg288"></a> Nothing exists in this
            objective and illusive world of ours that cannot be made to serve
            two purposes—a good and a bad one. Thus in later ages, the Initiates
            of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Left</span></em>
            Path and the anthropomorphists took in hand most of those venerable
            ruins, then silent and deserted by their first wise inmates, and
            turned them indeed into phallic monuments. But this was a
            deliberate, wilful, and vicious misinterpretation of their real
            meaning, a deflection from their first use. The Sun—though ever,
            even for the multitudes, μὸνος οὐρανοῦ θεὸς,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the only and one King and God in Heaven,”</span>
            and the Εὐβουλῆ,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the God of Good Counsel”</span> of
            Orpheus—had in every exoteric popular religion a dual aspect which
            was anthropomorphised by the profane. Thus the Sun was Osiris-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Typhon</span></span>, Ormuzd-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahriman</span></span>, Bel-Jupiter and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Baal</span></span>, the life-giving and the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">death</span></em>-giving luminary. And thus one and the same monolith, pillar,
            pyramid, tower or temple, originally built to glorify the first
            principle or aspect, might become in time an idol-fane, or worse, a
            phallic emblem in its crude and brutal form. The Lingam of the
            Hindus has a spiritual and highly philosophical meaning, while the
            missionaries see in it but an
            <span class="tei tei-q">“indecent emblem;”</span> it has just the
            meaning which is to be found in all those baalim, chammanim, and the
            bamoth with the pillars of unhewn stone of the Bible, set up for the
            glorification of the male Jehovah. But this does not alter the fact
            that the pureia of the Greeks, the nur-hags of Sardinia, the
            teocalli of Mexico, etc., were all in the beginning of the same
            character as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Round Towers”</span> of
            Ireland. They were sacred places of Initiation.

            In 1877, the writer, quoting the authority and opinions of some most
            eminent scholars, ventured to assert that there was a great
            difference between the terms
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Chrestos</span></span>

            means <span class="tei tei-q">“to live”</span> and

            corroboration of an erudite author, who proves whatever he
            undertakes to show on the authority of geometrical demonstration.
            There is a most curious passage with remarks and explanations in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Source of Measures</span></span>, whose author has probably never heard of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery-God”</span> Visvakarma of the early
            Âryans. Treating on the difference between the terms Chrest and
            Christ, he ends by saying that:

          <div class="block tei tei-quote" style="               margin-bottom: 1.8em;               margin-top: 1.8em;               margin-left: 3.6em;               margin-right: 3.6em;             ">
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.9em">
              <span style="font-size: 90%">There were two Messiahs: one who went down into the pit for the
                salvation of this world; this was the Sun shorn of his golden
                rays, and crowned with blackened ones (symbolising this loss),
                as the thorns: the other was the triumphant Messiah mounting up
                to the summit of the arch of heaven, and</span>
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">personified as the Lion of the Tribe of Judah</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. In both instances he had the cross; once in humiliation and
                once holding it in his control as the law of creation, He being

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And then the author proceeds to give
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the fact”</span> that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“there were two Messiahs,”</span> etc., as
            quoted above. And this—leaving the divine and mystic character and
            claim for Jesus entirely independent of this event of His mortal
            life—shows Him, beyond any doubt, as an Initiate of the Egyptian
            Mysteries, where the same rite of Death and of spiritual
            Resurrection for the neophyte, or the suffering Chrestos on his
            trial and new birth by Regeneration, was enacted—for this was a
            universally adopted rite.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“pit”</span> into which the Eastern
            Initiate was made to descend was, as shown before, Pâtâla, one of
            the seven regions of the nether world, over which ruled Vâsuki, the
            great <span class="tei tei-q">“snake God.”</span> This pit, Pâtâla,
            has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg290"></a> in the Eastern Symbolism
            precisely the same manifold meaning as is found by Mr. Ralston
            Skinner in the Hebrew word
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">shiac</span></span>
            in its application to the case in hand. For it was the synonym of
            Scorpio—Pâtâla's depths being
            <span class="tei tei-q">“impregnated with the brightness of the new Sun”</span>—represented by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“newly born”</span> into the glory; and
            Pâtâla was and is in a sense,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a pit, a grave, the place of death, and the door of Hades or
              Sheol”</span>—as, in the partially exoteric Initiations in India, the candidate
            had to pass through the matrix of the heifer before proceeding to
            Pâtâla. In its non-mystic sense it is the Antipodes—America being
            referred to in India as Pâtâla. But in its symbolism it meant all
            that, and much more. The fact alone that Vâsuki, the ruling Deity of
            Pâtâla, is represented in the Hindu Pantheon as the great Nâga
            (Serpent)—who was used by the Gods and Asuras as a rope round the
            mountain Mandara, at the churning of the ocean for Amrita, the water
            of immortality—connects him directly with Initiation.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            For he is Shesha Nâga also, serving as a couch for Vishnu, and
            upholding the seven worlds; and he is also Ananta,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the endless,”</span> and the symbol of
            eternity—hence the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God of Secret Wisdom,”</span> degraded by
            the Church to the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></span>
            of the tempting Serpent, of Satan. That what is now said is correct
            may be verified by the evidence of even the exoteric rendering of
            the attributes of various Gods and Sages both in the Hindu and the
            Buddhist Pantheons. Two instances will suffice to show how little
            our best and most erudite Orientalists are capable of dealing
            correctly and fairly with the symbolism of Eastern nations, while
            remaining ignorant of the corresponding points to be found only in
            Occultism and the Secret Doctrine.

            is the Secret Doctrine, the Occult Eastern Philosophy, which is the
            corner-stone of all sciences rejected by the unwise builders even at
            this day, and more to-day perhaps than ever before, in the great
            conceit of our age. The allegory means simply that Nâgârjuna having

            Adepts, <span class="tei tei-q">“the wise ones”</span>—and driven
            out from India by the Brâhmans, who dreaded to have their Mysteries
            and sacerdotal Science divulged (the real cause of their hatred of
            Buddhism), went away to China and Tibet, where he initiated many
            into the truths of the hidden Mysteries taught by Gautama Buddha.

            (2) The hidden symbolism of Nârada—the great Rishi and the author of
            some of the Rig-Vaidic hymns, who incarnated again later on during
            Krishna's time—has never been understood. Yet, in connection with
            the Occult Sciences, Nârada, the son of Brahmâ, is one of the most
            prominent characters; he is directly connected in his first
            incarnation with the <span class="tei tei-q">“Builders”</span>—hence
            with the seven <span class="tei tei-q">“Rectors”</span> of the
            Christian Church, who
            <span class="tei tei-q">“helped God in the work of creation.”</span>
            This grand personification is hardly noticed by our Orientalists,
            who refer only to that which he is alleged to have said of Pâtâla,
            namely,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that it is a place of sexual and sensual gratifications.”</span>
            This is thought to be amusing, and the reflection is suggested that
            Nârada, no doubt,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“found the place delightful.”</span> Yet
            this sentence simply shows him to have been an Initiate, connected
            directly with the Mysteries, and walking, as all the other
            neophytes, before and after him, had to walk, in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the pit among the thorns”</span> in the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sacrificial
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Chrest</span></span>
              condition,”</span>
            as the suffering victim made to descend thereinto—a mystery, truly!
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Nârada is one of the seven Rishis, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mind-born sons”</span> of Brahmâ. The fact
            of his having been during his incarnation a high Initiate—he, like
            Orpheus, being the founder of the Mysteries—is corroborated, and
            made evident by his history. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mahâbhârata</span></span>
            states that Nârada, having frustrated the scheme formed for peopling
            the universe, in order to remain true to his vow of chastity, was
            cursed by Daksha, and sentenced to be born once more. Again, when
            born during Krishna's time, he is accused of calling his father
            Brahmâ <span class="tei tei-q">“a false teacher,”</span> because the
            latter advised him to get married, and he refused to do so. This
            shows him to have been an Initiate, going against the orthodox
            worship and religion. It is curious to find this Rishi and leader
            among the <span class="tei tei-q">“Builders”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Host”</span> as
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"></a> the prototype of the
            Christian <span class="tei tei-q">“leader”</span> of the same
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Host”</span>—the Archangel Mikael. Both are
            the male <span class="tei tei-q">“Virgins,”</span> and both are the
            only ones among their respective
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Hosts”</span> who refuse to create. Nârada
            is said to have dissuaded the Hari-ashvas, the five thousand sons of
            Daksha, begotten by him for the purpose of peopling the Earth, from
            producing offspring. Since then the Hari-ashvas have
            <span class="tei tei-q">“dispersed themselves through the regions, and have never
              returned.”</span>
            The Initiates are, perhaps, the incarnations of these Hari-ashvas?

            It is all that and much more; archaic religious Philosophy was
            universal, and its Mysteries are as old as man. It is the eternal
            symbol of the personified Sun—astronomically purified—in its mystic
            meaning regenerated, and symbolised by all the Initiates in memory
            of a sinless Humanity when all were

            Jesus as a divine man? Not at all. On the contrary, made to stand

            In Egypt every city of importance was separated from its
            burial-place by a sacred lake. The same ceremony of judgment, as is
            described in

            Soul, and the solemn drama that was then taking place in the
            invisible realm whither the Soul had fled. The immortality of the

            and never lose for a moment the idea of his inner God or seventh
            Principle. Then, as a symbol of the wanderings of the unpurified
            Soul, he had to ascend several ladders and wander in darkness in a
            cave with many doors, all of which were locked. Having

            the sublime symbolism of Kosmos conceived in the matrix of Space
            after the divine Unit had entered into and fructified it with Its
            holy fiat, will no doubt suggest materiality. Not so with primitive
            mankind. The initiatory rite in the Mysteries of the
            self-sacrificing Victim that dies a spiritual death to save the
            world from destruction—really from depopulation—was established
            during the Fourth Race, to commemorate an event, which,
            physiologically, has now become the Mystery of Mysteries among the
            world-problems. In the Jewish script it is Cain and the female Abel
            who are the sacrificed and sacrificing couple—both immolating
            themselves (as permutations of Adam and Eve, or the dual Jehovah)
            and shedding their blood
            <span class="tei tei-q">“of separation and union,”</span> for the
            sake of and to save mankind by inaugurating a new physiological
            race. Later still, when the neophyte, as already mentioned, in order
            to be re-born once more into his lost spiritual state, had to pass
            through the entrails (the womb) of a
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">virgin</span></em>
            heifer<a href="#note_539" id="noteref_539" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a>
            killed at the moment of the rite, it involved again a mystery and
            one as great, for it referred to the process of birth, or rather the
            first entrance of man on to this earth, through Vâch—<span class="tei tei-q">“the melodious cow who milks forth sustenance and water”</span>—and who is the female Logos. It had also reference to the same
            self-sacrifice of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“divine Hermaphrodite”</span>—of the third
            Root-Race—the transformation of Humanity into truly physical men,
            after the loss of spiritual potency. When, the fruit of evil having
            been tasted along with the fruit of good, there was as a result the
            gradual atrophy of spirituality and a strengthening of the
            materiality in man, then he was doomed to be born thenceforth
            through the present process. This is the Mystery of the
            Hermaphrodite, which the Ancients kept so secret and veiled. It was
            neither the absence of moral feeling, nor the presence of gross
            sensuality in them that made them imagine their Deities under a dual
            aspect; but rather their knowledge of the mysteries and processes of
            primitive Nature. The Science of Physiology was better known to them
            than it is to us now. It is in this
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg296"></a> that lies buried the key
            to the Symbolism of old, the true focus of national thought, and the
            strange dual-sexed images of nearly every God and Goddess in both
            pagan and monotheistic Pantheons.

            We know through Herodotus that the Mysteries were brought from India
            by Orpheus—a hero far anterior to both Homer and Hesiod. Very little
            is really known of him, and till very lately Orphic literature, and
            even the Argonauts, were attributed to Onamacritus, a contemporary
            of Pisistratus, Solon and Pythagoras—who was credited with their
            compilation in the present form toward the close of the sixth
            century
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, or 800 years after the time of Orpheus. But we are told that in
            the days of Pausanias there was a sacerdotal family, who, like the
            Brâhmans with the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, had committed to memory all the Orphic Hymns, and that they were
            usually thus transmitted from one generation to another. By placing
            Orpheus so far back as 1200
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, official Science—so careful in her chronology to choose in each
            case as late a period as possible—admits that the Mysteries, or in
            other words Occultism dramatised, belong to a still earlier epoch
            than the Chaldæan and Egyptians.

            As was predicted by the great Hermes in his dialogue with
            Æsculapius, the time had indeed come when impious foreigners accused
            Egypt of adoring monsters, and naught but the letters engraved in
            stone upon her monuments survived—enigmas unintelligible to
            posterity. Her sacred Scribes and Hierophants became wanderers upon
            the face of the earth. Those who had remained in Egypt found
            themselves obliged for fear of a profanation of the sacred Mysteries
            to seek refuge in deserts and mountains, to form and establish
            secret societies and brotherhoods—such as the Essenes; those who had
            crossed the oceans to India and even to the (now-called) New World,
            bound themselves by solemn oaths to keep silent, and to preserve
            secret their Sacred Knowledge and Science; thus these were buried
            deeper than ever out of human sight. In Central Asia and on the
            northern borderlands of India, the triumphant sword of Aristotle's
            pupil swept away from his path of conquest every vestige of a once
            pure Religion: and its Adepts receded further and further from that
            path into the most hidden spots of the globe. The cycle of —— being
            at its close, the first hour for the disappearance of the Mysteries
            struck on the clock of the Races, with the Macedonian conqueror. The
            first strokes of its last hour sounded in the year 47

            but while History deprecates the action of the Arab general, Amrus,
            who gave the final touch to this act of vandalism perpetrated by the
            great conqueror, it has not a word to say to the latter for his
            destruction of nearly the same amount of precious rolls in Alesia,
            nor to the destroyer of Bibractis. While Sacrovir—chief of the
            Gauls, who revolted against Roman despotism under Tiberius, and was
            defeated by Silius in the year 21 of our era—was burning himself
            alive with his fellow conspirators on a funeral pyre before the
            gates of the city, as Ragon tells us, the latter was sacked and
            plundered, and all her treasures of literature on the Occult

            Alchemy also was first taught in Egypt by her learned Priests,

            <span class="tei tei-q">“red earth”</span> in one of its meanings.
            The correct information—under its allegorical veil—is found in the

            The Eleusinian Mysteries were no more. Yet it was these which gave
            their principal features to the Neo-platonic school of Ammonius
            Saccas, for the Eclectic System was chiefly characterised by its
            Theurgy and ecstasis. It was Iamblichus who added to it the Egyptian
            doctrine of Theurgy with its practices, and Porphyry, the Jew, who
            opposed this new element. The school, however, with but few
            exceptions, practised asceticism and contemplation, its mystics
            passing through a discipline as rigorous as that of the Hindu
            devotee. Their efforts never tended so much to develop the
            successful practice of thaumaturgy, necromancy or sorcery—such as
            they are now accused of—as to evolve the higher faculties of the
            inner man, the Spiritual Ego. The school held that a number of
            spiritual beings, denizens of spheres quite independent of the earth
            and of the human cycle, were mediators between the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods”</span> and men, and even between man
            and the Supreme Soul. To put it in plainer language, the soul of man
            became, owing to the help of the Planetary Spirits,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“recipient of the soul of the world”</span>
            as Emerson puts it. Apollonius of Tyana asserted his possession of
            such a power in these words (quoted by Professor Wilder in his

            century of our era; but it belongs to a much earlier age, as has
            been shown by Diogenes Laertius. He traces it to the beginning of
            the dynasty of the Ptolemies; to the great seer and prophet, the
            Egyptian Priest Pot-Amun, of the temple of the God of that name—for

            difficulties and hardships of chelaship, and the dangers attending
            Initiation. The modern candidate has, like his predecessor of old,

                golden candlestick hides one more mystery: it is the sign of
                Christ, not only in shape, but because he sheds his light
                through the ministry of the seven spirits primarily created, and
                who are the Seven Eyes of the Lord. Therefore the principal
                planets are to the seven primeval spirits, according to St.

            Plain enough, to be sure; though one fails to see that this
            explanation even helps the situation. The seven-branched chandelier
            of the Israelites, as well as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“wanderers”</span> of the Greeks, had a far
            more natural meaning, a purely astrological one to begin with. In
            fact from Magi and Chaldæans down to the much-laughed-at Zadkiel,
            every astrological work will tell its reader that the Sun placed in
            the midst of the planets, with Saturn, Jupiter and Mars on one side,
            and Venus, Mercury and the Moon on the other, the planets' line
            crossing through the whole Earth, has always meant what Hermes tells
            us, namely, the thread of destiny, or that whose action (influence)
            is called destiny.<a href="#note_597" id="noteref_597" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a>
            But symbol for symbol we prefer the sun to a candlestick. One can
            understand how the latter came to represent the sun and planets, but
            no one can admire the chosen symbol. There is poetry and grandeur in
            the sun when it is made to symbolize the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye of Ormuzd,”</span> or of Osiris, and is
            regarded as the Vâhan (vehicle) of the highest Deity. But one must
            for ever fail to perceive that any particular glory is rendered to
            Christ by assigning to him the trunk of a candlestick,<a href="#note_598" id="noteref_598" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">598</span></span></a>

            The Zoroastrians, Mazdeans, and Persians borrowed their conceptions
            from India; the Jews borrowed their theory of angels from Persia;
            the Christians borrowed from the Jews.

            Hence the latest interpretation by Christian theology—to the great
            disgust of the synagogue, forced to share the symbolical candlestick
            with the hereditary enemy—that the seven-branched candlestick
            represents the seven Churches of Asia and the seven planets which
            are the angels of those Churches. Hence also, the conviction that
            the Mosaic Jews, the inventors of that symbol for their tabernacle,
            were a kind of Sabæans, who blended their planets and the spirits
            thereof into one, and called them—only far later—Jehovah. For this
            we have the testimony of Clemens Alexandrinus, St. Hieronymus and
            others.

            are shown as being demoniacal before, and divine only after, the

            If the Roman Catholics are right on this point, so are the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Planets,”</span> the Dhyân Chohans of

            <span class="tei tei-q">“the mind-born sons of Brahmâ,”</span> known
            under the patronymic of Vaidhâtra. The identity between the Kumâras,

            Stars, will be found without one single flaw if their respective
            biographies are studied, and especially the characteristics of their
            chiefs, Sanat-Kumâra (Sanat Sujâta), and Michael the Archangel.
            Together with the Kabirim (Planets), the name of the above in

            sons of יצדיק meaning Pater Sadic, Cain, or Jupiter, or again of
            Jehovah. There are seven Kumâras—four exoteric and three secret—the
            names of the latter being found in the

            classical authors and philosophers who have treated the subject,
            repeat with Hermes Trismegistus, that the seven Rectors—the planets
            including the sun—were the associates, or the co-workers, of the
            Unknown All represented by the Demiurgos—commissioned to contain
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg329"></a> the Cosmos—our planetary
            world—within seven circles. Plutarch shows them representing
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the circle of the celestial worlds.”</span>
            Again, Denys of Thracia and the learned Clemens of Alexandria both
            describe the Rectors as being shown in the Egyptian temples in the
            shape of mysterious wheels or spheres always in motion, which made
            the Initiates affirm that the problem of perpetual motion had been

            paralysed spiritual perceptions. It is at the expense of wisdom that

            disobedience to the laws of Nature and the subsequent Fall, as a

            In order to show that the Ancients have never
            <span class="tei tei-q">“mistaken stars for Gods,”</span> or Angels
            and the sun for the highest Gods and God, but have worshipped only
            the Spirit of all, and have reverenced the minor Gods supposed to
            reside in the sun and planets—the difference between these two
            worships has to be pointed out. Saturn,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Father of Gods”</span> must not be
            confused with his namesake—the planet of the same name with its
            eight moons and three rings. The two—though in one sense identical,
            as are, for instance, physical man and his soul—must be separated in
            the question of worship. This has to be done the more carefully in
            the case of the seven planets and their Spirits, as the whole
            formation of the universe is attributed to them in the Secret
            Teachings. The same difference has to be shown again between the
            stars of the Great Bear, the Riksha and the Chitra Shikhandina,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the bright-crested,”</span> and the
            Rishis—the mortal Sages who appeared on earth during the Satya Yuga.
            If all of these have been so far closely united in the visions of
            the seers of every age—the bible seers included—there must have been
            a reason for it. Nor need one go back so far as into the periods of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“unscientific fancies”</span> to find great
            men in our epoch sharing in them. It is well known that Kepler, the
            eminent astronomer, in common with many other great men who believed
            that the heavenly bodies ruled favourably or adversely the fates of
            men and nations—fully credited besides this the fact that all
            heavenly bodies, even our own earth, are endowed with living and
            thinking souls.

                Tycho Brahe, Kepler, etc., there is reason why we should be
                careful. Kepler was an astrologer by profession, and became an
                astronomer in consequence. He was earning his livelihood by
                genethliac figures, which, indicating the state of the heavens
                at the moment of the birth of individuals, were a means to which
                everyone resorted for horoscopes. That great man was a believer

            But astrology is nevertheless proclaimed as a sinful science, and
            together with Occultism is tabooed by the Churches. It is very
            doubtful, however, whether mystic
            <span class="tei tei-q">“star worship”</span> can be so easily
            laughed down as people imagine—at any rate by Christians. The hosts
            of Angels, Cherubs and Planetary Archangels are identical with the
            minor Gods of the Pagans. As to their
            <span class="tei tei-q">“great Gods,”</span> if Mars has been
            shown—on the admission of even the enemies of the Pagan
            astrologers—to have been regarded by the latter simply as the
            personified strength of the one highest impersonal Deity, Mercury
            being personified as its omniscience, Jupiter as its omnipotency,
            and so on, then the <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition”</span> of
            the Pagan has indeed become the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span> of the masses of the
            civilized nations. For with the latter, Jehovah is the synthesis of
            the seven Elohim, the eternal centre of all those attributes and
            forces, the Alei of the Aleim, and the Adonai of the Adonim. And if
            with them Mars is now called St. Michael, the

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The books of Hermes Trismegistus contain the exoteric meaning, still
            veiled for all but the Occultist, of the Astrology and Astrolatry of
            the Khaldi. The two subjects are closely connected. Astrolatry, or
            the adoration of the heavenly host, is the natural result of only
            half-revealed Astrology, whose Adepts carefully concealed from the
            non-initiated masses its Occult principles and the wisdom imparted
            to them by the Regents of the Planets—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Angels.”</span> Hence, divine Astrology for
            the Initiates; superstitious Astrolatry for the profane. St. Justin
            asserts it:
          </p>

                vulgar, but the distinguished and select men who became
                initiated in the secrecy of the temples into the science of
                every kind of Astrology—even into its most abject kind: that
                Astrology which later on found itself prostituted in the public
                thoroughfares.</span>
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            There was a vast difference between the Sacred Science taught by
            Petosiris and Necepso—the first Astrologers mentioned in the
            Egyptian manuscripts, believed to have lived during the reign of
            Ramses II. (Sesostris)<a href="#note_622" id="noteref_622" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">622</span></span></a>—and the miserable charlatanry of the quacks called Chaldæans, who
            degraded the Divine Knowledge under the last Emperors of Rome.
            Indeed, one may fairly describe the two as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“high ceremonial Astrology”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“astrological Astrolatry.”</span> The first
            depended on the knowledge by the Initiates of those (to us)
            immaterial Forces or Spiritual Entities that affect matter and guide
            it. Called by the ancient Philosophers the Archontes and the
            Cosmocratores, they were the types or paradigms on the higher planes
            of the lower and more material beings on the scale of evolution,
            whom we call Elementals and Nature-Spirits, to whom the Sabæans
            bowed and whom they worshipped, without suspecting the essential
            difference. Hence
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg338"></a> the latter kind when not
            a mere pretence, degenerated but too often into Black Magic. It was
            the favourite form of popular or exoteric Astrology, entirely
            ignorant of the apotelesmatic principles of the primitive Science,
            the doctrines of which were imparted only at Initiation. Thus, while
            the real Hierophants soared like Demi-Gods to the very summit of
            spiritual knowledge, the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">hoi polloi</span></span>
            among the Sabæans crouched, steeped in superstition—ten millenniums
            back, as they do now—in the cold and lethal shadow of the valleys of
            matter. Sidereal influence is dual. There is the physical and
            physiological influence, that of exotericism; and the high
            spiritual, intellectual, and moral influence, imparted by the
            knowledge of the planetary Gods. Bailly, speaking with only an
            imperfect knowledge of the former, called Astrology, so far back as
            the eighteenth century,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The very foolish mother of a very wise daughter”</span>—Astronomy. On the other hand, Arago, a luminary of the nineteenth
            century, supports the reality of the sidereal influence of the Sun,
            Moon and Planets. He asks:

                vegetation and animals? Has not modern science demonstrated now
                these two points beyond any doubt?... Is it any less true that

                which Bailly charges their theory (Astrology), the reprobate has
                no sense whatever. All the great astrologers admitted, without

            principles, which are the same in both kinds, but in the Astrologer
            himself. Thus Pythagoras, who established the whole Copernican
            system by the Books of Hermes 2,000 years before Galileo's
            predecessor was born, found and studied in them the whole Science of
            divine Theogony, of the communication with, and the evocation of,
            the world's Rectors—the Princes of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Principalities”</span> of St. Paul—the
            nativity of each Planet and of the Universe itself, the formulæ of
            incantations and the consecration of each portion of the human body
            to the respective Zodiacal sign corresponding to it. All this cannot
            be regarded as childish and absurd—still less
            <span class="tei tei-q">“devilish”</span>—save by those who are, and
            wish to remain, tyros in the Philosophy of the Occult Sciences. No

            From the Kasdim and Gazzim (Astrologers) the noble primitive science
            passed to the Khartumim Asaphim (or Theologians) and the Hakamim (or
            scientists, the Magicians of the lower class), and from these to the
            Jews during their captivity. The Books of Moses had been buried in
            oblivion for centuries, and when re-discovered by Hilkiah had lost
            their true sense for the people of Israel. Primitive Occult
            Astrology was on the decline when Daniel, the last of the Jewish
            Initiates of the old school, became the chief of the Magi and
            Astrologers of Chaldæa. In those days even Egypt, who had her wisdom
            from the same source as Babylon, had degenerated from her former
            grandeur, and her glory had begun to fade out. Still, the science of
            old had left her eternal imprint on the world, and the seven great
            Primitive Gods reigned for ever in the Astrology and in the division
            of time of every nation upon the face of the earth. The names of the
            days of our (Christian) week are those of the Gods of the Chaldæans,
            who translated them from those of the Âryans; the uniformity of
            these antediluvian names in every nation, from the Goths back to the

            the riddle been explained to us by the invitation made by the

            without an Astrologer recommended to him by Cleopatra. Augustus,
            when ascending the throne, had his horoscope drawn by Theagenes.
            Tiberius discovered pretenders to his throne by means of Astrology
            and divination. Vitellius dared not exile the Chaldæans, as they had
            announced the day of their banishment as that of his death.
            Vespasian consulted them daily; Domitian would not move without
            being advised by the prophets; Adrian was a learned Astrologer
            himself; and all of them, ending with Julian (called the

                minute investigations of their successors, the chemists; a very

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            We have already drawn attention to the facts that the record of the
            life of a World-Saviour is emblematical, and must be read by its
            mystic meaning, and that the figures 432 have a cosmic evolutionary
            significance. We find these two facts throwing light on the origin
            of the exoteric Christian religion, and clearing away much of the
            obscurity surrounding its beginnings. For is it not clear that the
            names and characters in the Synoptical Gospels and in that of St.
            John are not historical? Is it not evident that the compilers of the
            life of Christ, desirous to show that the birth of their Master was
            a cosmic, astronomical, and divinely-preördained event, attempted to
            coördinate the same with the end of the secret cycle, 4,320? When
            facts are collated this answers to them as little as does the other
            cycle of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“thirty-three solar years, seven months, and seven days,”</span>
            which has also been brought forward as supporting the same claim,
            the soli-lunar cycle in which the Sun gains on the Moon one solar
            year. The combination of the three figures, 4, 3, 2, with cyphers
            according to the cycle and Manvantara concerned, was, and is,
            preëminently Hindu. It will remain a secret even though several of
            its significant features are revealed. It relates, for instance, to
            the Pralaya of the races in their periodical dissolution, before
            which events a special Avatâra has always to descend and incarnate
            on earth. These figures were adopted by all the older nations, such
            as those of Egypt and Chaldæa, and before them were current among
            the Atlanteans. Evidently some of the more learned among the early
            Church Fathers who had dabbled, whilst Pagans, in temple secrets,
            knew them to relate to the Avatâric or Messianic mystery, and tried
            to apply this cycle to the birth of their Messiah; they failed
            because the figures relate to the respective ends of the Root-Races
            and not to any individual. In their badly-directed efforts,
            moreover, an error of five years occurred. Is it possible, if their
            claims as to the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg346"></a> importance and
            universality of the event were correct, that such a vital mistake
            should have been allowed to creep into a chronological computation
            preördained and traced in the heavens by the finger of God? Again,
            what were the Pagan and even Jewish Initiates doing, if this claim
            as to Jesus be correct? Could they, the custodians of the key to the
            secret cycles and Avatâras, the heirs of all the Âryan, Egyptian,
            and Chaldæan wisdom, have failed to recognise their great
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God-Incarnate,”</span> one with Jehovah,<a href="#note_634" id="noteref_634" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a>
            their Saviour of the latter days, him whom all the nations of Asia
            still expect as their Kalki Avatâra, Maitreya Buddha, Sosiosh,
            Messiah, etc.?
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The simple secret is this: There are cycles within greater cycles,
            which are all contained in the one Kalpa of 4,320,000 years. It is
            at the end of this cycle that the Kalki Avatâra is expected—the
            Avatâra Whose name and characteristics are secret, Who will come
            forth from Shamballa, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“City of Gods,”</span> which is in the West
            for some nations, in the East for others, in the North or South for
            yet others. And this is the reason why, from the Indian Rishi to
            Virgil, and from Zoroaster down to the latest Sibyl, all have, since
            the beginning of the Fifth Race, prophesied, sung, and promised the
            cyclic return of the Virgin—Virgo, the constellation—and the birth
            of a divine child who should bring back to our earth the Golden Age.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            No one, however fanatical, would have sufficient hardihood to
            maintain that the Christian era has ever been a return to the Golden
            Age—Virgo having actually entered into Libra since then. Let us
            trace as briefly as possible the Christian traditions to their true
            origin.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            First of all, they discover in a few lines from Virgil a direct
            prophecy of the birth of Christ. Yet it is impossible to detect in
            this prophecy any feature of the present age. It is in the famous
            fourth Eclogue in which, half a century before our era, Pollio is
            made to ask the Muses of Sicily to sing to him about greater events.

            It is in these few lines, called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sibylline prophecy about the coming of Christ,”</span>
            that his followers now see a direct foretelling of the event. Now

            since the establishment of the so-called Christian religion, any

            be in full sway just now, not only because the Hindus use the name,
            but by universal personal experience. Where is that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“new race that has descended from the celestial realms”</span>? Was it the race that emerged from Paganism into Christianity? Or
            is it our present race, with nations ever red-hot for fight, jealous

            The astronomical cycles of the Hindus—those taught publicly—have

            in its application to transcendental subjects connected with them,
            has ever remained a dead-letter. The number of cycles was enormous;
            it ranged from the Mahâ Yuga cycle of 4,320,000 years down to the
            small septenary and quinquennial cycles, the latter being composed

            It is no news that as the Hindus divided the earth into seven zones,
            so the more western peoples—Chaldæans, Phœnicians, and even the
            Jews, who got their learning either directly or indirectly from the
            Brâhmans—made all their secret and sacred numerations by 6 and 12,
            though using the number 7 whenever this would not lend itself to
            handling. Thus the numerical base of 6, the exoteric figure given by
            Ârya Bhatta, was made good use of. From the first secret cycle of
            600—the Naros, transformed successively into 60,000 and 60 and 6,
            and, with other noughts added into other secret cycles—down to the
            smallest, an Archæologist and Mathematician can easily find it
            repeated in every country, known to every nation. Hence the globe
            was divided into 60 degrees, which, multiplied by 60, became 3,600
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“great year.”</span> Hence also the hour
            with its 60 minutes of 60 seconds each. The Asiatic people count a
            cycle of 60 years also, after which comes the lucky seventh decad,
            and the Chinese have their small cycle of 60 days, the Jews of 6
            days, the Greeks of 6 centuries—the Naros again.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg352"></a> The Babylonians had a
            great year of 3,600, being the Naros multiplied by 6. The Tartar
            cycle called Van was 180 years, or three sixties; this multiplied by
            12 times 12 = 144, makes 25,920 years, the exact period of
            revolution of the heavens.

                ... to explain these seeming differences we must have recourse
                to their books of science, where we find the heavens and the
                earth divided into</span>
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">five parts</span></em>
              <span style="font-size: 90%">of unequal dimensions, by circles parallel to the equator.
                Attention to these divisions will be found to be of the utmost
                importance ... as it will be found that from them arose the
                division of their Maha-Yuga into its four component parts. Every
                astronomer knows that there is a point in the heavens called the
                pole, round which the whole seems to turn in twenty-four hours;
                and that at ninety degrees from it they imagine a</span>

                the north and the south. Between this circle and the pole there
                is another imaginary circle called the circle of</span>
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">perpetual apparition</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">: between which and the equator there is a point in the heavens
                called the zenith, through which let another imaginary circle
                pass, parallel to the other two; and then there wants but the
                circle of perpetual occultation to complete the round.... No
                astronomer of Europe besides myself has ever applied them to the
                development of the Hindu mysterious numbers. We are told in

                is in the latitude of 36 degrees. And in that latitude the
                circle of perpetual apparition would extend up to 72 degrees
                altitude, and from that to the zenith there are but 18 degrees,
                but from the zenith to the equator in that latitude there are 36
                degrees, and from the equator to the circle of perpetual
                occultation there are 54 degrees. Here we find the semi-circle
                of 180 degrees divided into four parts, in the proportion of 1,
                2, 3, 4,</span>

                parallel circles from the equator to the poles ... or what
                amounts to the same thing, the north pole of the ecliptic would
                have moved from the north pole of the earth to the equator....
                Thus the poles become inverted in 1,080,000 years, which is
                their Maha Yuga, and which they had divided into four unequal
                parts, in the proportions of 1, 2, 3, 4, for the reasons
                mentioned above; which are 108,000, 216,000, 324,000, and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            A strange story—a legend rather—is persistently current among the
            disciples of some great Himâlayan Gurus, and even among laymen, to
            the effect that Gautama, the Prince of Kapilavastu, has never left
            the terrestrial regions, though his body died and was burnt, and its
            relics are preserved to this day. There is an oral tradition among
            the Chinese Buddhists, and a written statement among the secret
            books of the Lamaists of Tibet, as well as a tradition among the
            Âryans, that Gautama
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Buddha</span></span>
            had two doctrines: one for the masses and His lay disciples, the
            other for His <span class="tei tei-q">“elect,”</span> the Arhats.
            His policy and after Him that of His Arhats was, it appears, to
            refuse no one admission into the ranks of candidates for Arhatship,
            but never to divulge the final mysteries except to those who had
            proved themselves, during long years of probation, to be worthy of
            Initiation. These once accepted were consecrated and initiated
            without distinction of race, caste or wealth, as in the case of His
            western successor. It is the Arhats who have set forth and allowed
            this tradition to take root in the people's mind, and it is the
            basis, also, of the later dogma of Lamaic reincarnation or the
            succession of human Buddhas.

            The little that can be said here upon the subject may or may not
            help to guide the psychic student in the right direction. It being
            left to the option and responsibility of the writer to tell the
            facts as she

            fall only upon her. She has been taught the doctrine, but it was
            left to her sole intuition—as it is now left to the sagacity of the
            reader—to group the mysterious and perplexing facts together. The
            incomplete statements herein given are fragments of what is
            contained in certain secret volumes, but it is not lawful to divulge
            the details.

            The esoteric version of the mystery given in the secret volumes may
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg362"></a> be told very briefly. The
            Buddhists have always stoutly denied that their Buddha was, as
            alleged by the Brâhmans, an Avatâra of Vishnu in the same sense as a
            man is an incarnation of his Karmic ancestor. They deny it partly,
            perhaps, because the esoteric meaning of the term
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mahâ Vishnu”</span> is not known to them in
            its full, impersonal, and general meaning. There is a mysterious
            Principle in Nature called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mahâ Vishnu,”</span> which is not the God
            of that name, but a principle which contains Bîja, the seed of
            Avatârism or, in other words, is the potency and cause of such
            divine incarnations. All the World-Saviours, the Bodhisattvas and
            the Avatâras, are the trees of salvation grown out from the one
            seed, the Bîja or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mahâ Vishnu.”</span> Whether it be called
            Âdi-Buddha (Primeval Wisdom) or Mahâ Vishnu, it is all the same.
            Understood esoterically, Vishnu is both Saguna and Nirguna (with and
            without attributes). In the first aspect, Vishnu is the object of
            exoteric worship and devotion; in the second, as Nirguna, he is the
            culmination of the totality of spiritual wisdom in the
            Universe—Nirvâna,<a href="#note_647" id="noteref_647" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a>
            in short—and has as worshippers all philosophical minds. In this
            esoteric sense the Lord
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Buddha</span></span>
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>
            an incarnation of Mahâ Vishnu.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            This is from the philosophical and purely spiritual standpoint. From
            the plane of illusion, however, as one would say, or from the
            terrestrial standpoint, those initiated
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>
            that He was a direct incarnation of one of the primeval
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Sons of Light”</span> who are to be
            found in every Theogony—the Dhyân Chohans whose mission it is, from
            one eternity (æon) to the other, to watch over the spiritual welfare
            of the regions under their care. This has been already enunciated in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>.

            One of the greatest mysteries of speculative and philosophical
            Mysticism—and it is one of the mysteries now to be disclosed—is the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">modus operandi</span></span>
            in the degrees of such hypostatic transferences. As a matter of
            course, divine as well as human incarnations must remain a closed
            book to the theologian as much as to the physiologist, unless the
            esoteric teachings be accepted and become the religion of the world.
            This teaching may never be fully explained to an unprepared public;
            but one thing is certain and may be said now: that between the dogma
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg363"></a> of a newly-created soul
            for each new birth, and the physiological assumption of a temporary

            line, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> or one of the
            seven Flames becoming, for the time being, the Son, and these two
            being one—in Eternity. What is the Father? Is it the absolute Cause
            of all?—the fathomless Eternal? No; most decidedly. It is Kâranâtmâ,
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Causal Soul”</span> which, in its

            From the standpoint of unity it is so; but then the lowest of the

            There is a great mystery in such incarnations and they are outside
            and beyond the cycle of general re-births. Rebirths may be divided
            into three classes: the divine incarnations called Avatâras; those
            of Adepts who give up Nirvâna for the sake of helping on
            humanity—the Nirmânakâyas; and the natural succession of rebirths
            for all—the common law. The Avatâra is an appearance, one which may
            be termed a special illusion within the natural illusion that reigns
            on the planes under the sway of that power, Mâyâ; the Adept is
            re-born consciously, at his will and pleasure;<a href="#note_650" id="noteref_650" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a>

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>
            an Avatâra? for the term before being used ought to be well
            understood. It is a descent of the manifested Deity—whether under
            the specific name of Shiva, Vishnu, or Âdi-Buddha—into an illusive
            form of individuality, an appearance which to men on this illusive
            plane is objective, but is not so in sober fact. That illusive form,
            having neither past nor future, because it had neither previous
            incarnation nor will have subsequent rebirths, has naught to do with
            Karma, which has therefore no hold on it.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Gautama
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Buddha</span></span>
            was born an Avatâra in one sense. But this, in view of unavoidable
            objections on dogmatic grounds, necessitates explanation. There is a
            great difference between an Avatâra and a Jîvanmukta: one, as
            already stated, is an illusive appearance, Karma-less, and having
            never before incarnated; and the other, the Jîvanmukta, is one who
            obtains Nirvâna by his individual merits. To this expression again
            an uncompromising, philosophical Vedântin would object. He might say
            that as the condition of the Avatâra and the Jîvanmukta are one and
            the same state, no amount of personal merit, in howsoever many
            incarnations, can lead its possessor to Nirvâna. Nirvâna, he would
            say, is actionless; how can, then, any action lead to it? It is
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg365"></a> neither a result nor a
            cause, but an ever-present, eternal
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Is</span></em>, as Nâgasena defined it. Hence it can have no relation to, or
            concern with, action, merit, or demerit, since these are subject to
            Karma. All this is very true, but still to our mind there is an
            important difference between the two. An Avatâra
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>; a Jîvanmukta
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">becomes</span></em>
            one. If the state of the two is identical, not so are the causes
            which lead to it. An Avatâra is a descent of a God into an illusive
            form; a Jîvanmukta, who may have passed through numberless
            incarnations and may have accumulated merit in them, certainly does
            not become a Nirvânî because of that merit, but only because of the
            Karma generated by it, which leads and guides him in the direction
            of the Guru who will initiate him into the mystery of Nirvâna and
            who alone can help him to reach this abode.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The Shâstras say that from our works alone we obtain Moksha, and if
            we take no pains there will be no gain and we shall be neither
            assisted nor benefited by Deity [the Mahâ-Guru]. Therefore it is
            maintained that Gautama, though an Avatâra in one sense, is a true
            human Jîvanmukta, owing his position to his personal merit, and thus
            more than an Avatâra. It was his personal merit that enabled him to
            achieve Nirvâna.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Of the voluntary and conscious incarnations of Adepts there are two
            types—those of Nirmânakâyas, and those undertaken by the
            probationary chelâs who are on their trial.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The greatest, as the most puzzling mystery of the first type lies in
            the fact, that such re-birth in a human body of the personal Ego of
            some particular Adept—when it has been dwelling in the Mâyâvi or the
            Kâma Rûpa, and remaining in the Kâma Loka—may happen even when his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Higher Principles”</span> are in the state
            of Nirvâna.<a href="#note_651" id="noteref_651" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a>
            Let it be understood that the above expressions are used for popular
            purposes, and therefore that what is written does not deal with this
            deep and mysterious question from the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">highest</span></em>
            plane, that of absolute spirituality, nor again from the highest
            philosophical point of view, comprehensible but to the very few. It
            must not be supposed that anything can go
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg366"></a> into Nirvâna which is not
            eternally there; but human intellect in conceiving the Absolute must
            put It as the highest term in an indefinite series. If this be borne
            in mind a great deal of misconception will be avoided. The content
            of this spiritual evolution is the material on various planes with
            which the Nirvânî was in contact prior to his attainment of Nirvâna.
            The plane on which this is true, being in the series of illusive
            planes, is undoubtedly not the highest. Those who search for that
            must go to the right source of study, the teachings of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>, and must go in the right spirit. Here we attempt only to indicate
            the direction in which the search is to be made, and in showing a
            few of the mysterious Occult possibilities we do not bring our
            readers actually to the goal. The ultimate truth can be communicated
            only from Guru to initiated pupil.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Having said so much, the statement still will and must appear
            incomprehensible, if not absurd, to many. Firstly, to all those who
            are unfamiliar with the doctrine of the manifold nature and various
            aspects of the human Monad; and secondly to those who view the
            septenary division of the human entity from a too materialistic
            standpoint. Yet the intuitional Occultist, who has studied
            thoroughly the mysteries of Nirvâna—who knows it to be identical
            with Parabrahman, and hence unchangeable, eternal and no Thing but
            the Absolute All—will seize the possibility of the fact. They know
            that while a Dharmakâya—a Nirvânî
            <span class="tei tei-q">“without remains,”</span> as our
            Orientalists have translated it, being absorbed into that
            Nothingness, which is the one real, because Absolute,
            Consciousness—cannot be said to return to incarnation on Earth, the
            Nirvânî being no longer a he, a she, or even an it, the
            Nirmânakâya—or he who has obtained Nirvâna
            <span class="tei tei-q">“with remains,”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, who is clothed in a subtle body, which makes him impervious to
            all outward impressions and to every mental feeling, and in whom the
            notion of his Ego has not entirely ceased—can do so. Again, every
            Eastern Occultist is aware of the fact that there are two kinds of
            Nirmânakâyas—the natural, and the assumed; that the former is the
            name or epithet given to the condition of a high ascetic, or
            Initiate, who has reached a stage of bliss second only to Nirvâna;
            while the latter means the self-sacrifice of one who voluntarily
            gives up the absolute Nirvâna, in order to help humanity and be
            still doing it good, or, in other words, to save his
            fellow-creatures by guiding them. It may be objected that the
            Dharmakâya, being a Nirvânî or Jîvanmukta, can have no
            <span class="tei tei-q">“remains”</span> left behind him after
            death, for having attained that
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg367"></a> state from which no
            further incarnations are possible, there is no need for him of a
            subtle body, or of the individual Ego that reincarnates from one
            birth to another, and that therefore the latter disappears of
            logical necessity; to this it is answered: it is so for all exoteric
            purposes and as a general law. But the case with which we are
            dealing is an exceptional one, and its realization lies within the
            Occult powers of the high Initiate, who, before entering into the
            state of Nirvâna, can cause his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“remains”</span> (sometimes, though not very
            well, called his Mâyâvi Rûpa), to remain behind,<a href="#note_652" id="noteref_652" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a>
            whether he is to become a Nirvânî, or to find himself in a lower
            state of bliss.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Next, there are cases—rare, yet more frequent than one would be
            disposed to expect—which are the voluntary and conscious
            reincarnations of Adepts<a href="#note_653" id="noteref_653" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a>
            on their trial. Every man has an Inner, a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Higher Self,”</span> and also an Astral
            Body. But few are those who, outside the higher degrees of
            Adeptship, can guide the latter, or any of the principles that
            animate it, when once death has closed their short terrestrial life.
            Yet such guidance, or their transference from the dead to a living
            body, is not only possible, but is of frequent occurrence, according
            to Occult and Kabalistic teachings. The degrees of such power of
            course vary greatly. To mention but three: the lowest of these
            degrees would allow an Adept, who has been greatly trammelled during
            life in his study and in the use of his powers, to choose after
            death another body in which he could go on with his interrupted
            studies, though ordinarily he would lose in it every remembrance of
            his previous incarnation. The next degree permits him, in addition
            to this, to transfer the memory of his past life to his new body;
            while the highest has hardly any limits in the exercise of that
            wonderful faculty.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            As an instance of an Adept who enjoyed the first mentioned power
            some mediæval Kabalists cite a well-known personage of the fifteenth
            century—Cardinal de Cusa; Karma, due to his wonderful devotion to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg 368]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg368"></a> Esoteric study and the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, led the suffering Adept to seek intellectual recuperation and
            rest from ecclesiastical tyranny in the body of Copernicus.
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Se non e vero e ben trovato</span></span>; and the perusal of the lives of the two men might easily lead a
            believer in such powers to a ready acceptance of the alleged fact.
            The reader having at his command the means to do so is asked to turn
            to the formidable folio in Latin of the fifteenth century, called
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Docta Ignorantia</span></span>, written by the Cardinal de Cusa, in which all the theories and
            hypotheses—all the ideas—of Copernicus are found as the key-notes to
            the discoveries of the great astronomer.<a href="#note_654" id="noteref_654" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a>
            Who was this extraordinarily learned Cardinal? The son of a poor
            boatman, owing all his career, his Cardinal's hat, and the
            reverential awe rather than friendship of the Popes Eugenius IV.,
            Nicholas V., and Pius II., to the extraordinary learning which
            seemed innate in him, since he had studied nowhere till
            comparatively late in life. De Cusa died in 1473; moreover, his best
            works were written before he was forced to enter orders—to escape
            persecution. Nor did the Adept escape it.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            In the voluminous work of the Cardinal above-quoted is found a very
            suggestive sentence, the authorship of which has been variously
            attributed to Pascal, to Cusa himself, and to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, and which belongs by right to the Books of Hermes:

            The theory of rebirth must be set forth by Occultists, and then
            applied to special cases. The right comprehension of this psychic
            fact is based upon a correct view of that group of celestial Beings
            who are universally called the seven Primeval Gods or Angels—our
            Dhyân Chohans—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Primeval Rays”</span> or Powers,
            adopted later on by the Christian Religion as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Angels of the Presence.”</span>
            Arûpa, formless, at the upper rung of the ladder of Being,
            materializing more and more as they descend in the scale of
            objectivity and form, ending in the grossest and most imperfect of
            the Hierarchy, man—it is the former purely spiritual group that is
            pointed out to us, in our Occult teaching, as the nursery and
            fountain-head of human beings. Therein germinates that consciousness
            which is the earliest manifestation from causal Consciousness—the
            Alpha and the Omega of divine being and life for ever. And as it
            proceeds downward through every phase of existence descending
            through man, through animal and plant, it ends its descent only in
            the mineral. It is represented by the double triangle—the most
            mysterious and the most suggestive of all mystic signs, for it is a
            double glyph, embracing spiritual and physical consciousness and
            life, the former triangle running upwards, and the lower downwards,
            both interlaced, and showing the various planes of the twice-seven
            modes of consciousness, the fourteen spheres of existence, the Lokas
            of the Brâhmans.

            The reader may now be able to obtain a clearer comprehension of the
            whole thing. He will also see what is meant by the

            the Guardian or Regent over each of the seven divisions or regions

            The septenary principle in man—who can be regarded as dual only as
            concerns psychic manifestation on this gross earthly plane—was known
            to all antiquity, and may be found in every ancient Scripture. The
            Egyptians knew and taught it, and their division of principles is in
            every point a counterpart of the Âryan Secret Teaching. It is thus

            or again, Planetary Angels, etc.—shining in æonic eternity as their
            prototypes. It is in their image that some men are born, and when
            some specific humanitarian object is in view, the latter are
            hypostatically animated by their divine prototypes reproduced again

            much of the doctrine, and several of them giving many an erroneous
            view, this vague allusion may be amplified and explained. Not only

            general, but also to men of genius, to every remarkable man of the
            age, who soars beyond the common herd with some abnormally developed
            special capacity in him, leading to the progress and good of
            mankind. Each is a reincarnation of an individuality that has gone
            before him with capacities in the same line, bringing thus as a
            dowry to his new form that strong and easily re-awakened capacity or
            quality which had been fully developed in him in his preceding
            birth. Very often they are ordinary mortals, the Egos of natural men

            But it is with <span class="tei tei-q">“special cases”</span> that
            we are now concerned. Let us suppose that a person during his cycle
            of incarnations is thus selected for special purposes—the vessel
            being sufficiently clean—by his personal God, the Fountain-head (on
            the plane of the manifested) of his Monad, who thus becomes his
            in-dweller. That God, his own prototype or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father in Heaven,”</span> is, in one sense,
            not only the image in which he, the spiritual man, is made, but in
            the case we are considering, it is that spiritual, individual Ego
            himself. This is a case of permanent, life-long Theophania. Let us
            bear in mind that this is neither Avatârism, as it is understood in
            Brâhmanical Philosophy, nor is the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg372"></a> man thus selected a
            Jîvanmukta or Nirvânî, but that it is a wholly exceptional case in
            the realm of Mysticism. The man may or may not have been an Adept in
            his previous lives; he is so far, and simply, an extremely pure and
            spiritual individual—or one who was all that in his preceding birth,
            if the vessel thus selected is that of a newly-born infant. In this
            case, after the physical translation of such a saint or Bodhisattva,
            his astral principles cannot be subjected to a natural dissolution
            like those of any common mortal. They remain in our sphere and
            within human attraction and reach; and thus it is that not only a
            Buddha, a Shankarâchârya, or a Jesus can be said to animate several
            persons at one and the same time, but even the principles of a high
            Adept may be animating the outward tabernacles of common mortals.

            is acting—even though only mechanically—or resting in one place, its
            astral double may be appearing and acting independently in another,
            and very often distant place. This is quite a common occurrence in
            mystic life and history, and if this be so with ecstatics, Seers and
            Mystics of every description, why cannot the same thing happen on a

            possibility on the lower psychic plane, then why not on a higher
            plane? In the cases of higher Adeptship, when the body is entirely
            at the command of the Inner Man, when the Spiritual Ego is
            completely reünited with its seventh principle even during the
            life-time of the personality, and the Astral Man or personal Ego has
            become so purified that he has gradually assimilated all the
            qualities and attributes of the middle nature (Buddhi and Manas in
            their terrestrial aspect) that personal Ego substitutes itself, so
            to say, for the spiritual Higher Self, and is thenceforth capable of
            living an independent life on earth; when corporeal death takes
            place the following mysterious event often happens. As a Dharmakâya,
            a Nirvânî <span class="tei tei-q">“without remains”</span> entirely
            free from terrestrial admixture, the Spiritual Ego cannot return to
            reincarnate on earth. But in such cases, it is affirmed, the
            personal Ego of even a Dharmakâya can remain in our sphere as a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page373">[pg 373]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg373"></a> whole, and return to
            incarnation on earth if need be. For now it can no longer be
            subject, like the astral remains of any ordinary man, to gradual
            dissolution in the Kâma Loka (the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">limbus</span></span>

            natural light and spirituality, either to sleep in the unconscious

            The <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery of Buddha”</span> is that of
            several other Adepts—perhaps of many. The whole trouble is to
            understand correctly that other mystery: that of the real fact, so
            abstruse and transcendental at first sight, about the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Principles”</span> in man, the
            reflections in man of the seven powers in Nature, physically, and of
            the seven Hierarchies of Being, intellectually and spiritually.
            Whether a man—material, ethereal, and spiritual—is for the clearer
            comprehension of his (broadly-speaking) triple nature, divided into
            groups according to one or another system, the foundation and the
            apex of that division will be always the same. There being only
            three Upâdhis (bases) in man, any number of Koshas (sheaths) and
            their aspects may be built on these without destroying the harmony
            of the whole. Thus, while the Esoteric System accepts the septenary
            division, the Vedântic classification gives five Koshas, and the
            Târaka Râja Yoga simplifies them into four—the three Upâdhis
            synthesized by the highest principle, Âtmâ.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            That which has just been stated will, of course, suggest the
            question:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“How can a spiritual (or semi-spiritual) personality lead a
              triple or even a dual life, shifting respective
              <span class="tei tei-q">‘Higher Selves’</span>
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ad libitum</span></span>, and be still the one eternal Monad in the infinity of a
              Manvantara?”</span>
            The answer to this is easy for the true Occultist, while for the
            uninitiated profane it must appear absurd. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Principles”</span> are, of course,
            the manifestation of one indivisible Spirit, but only at the end of
            the Manvantara, and when they come to be re-united on the plane of
            the One Reality does the unity appear; during the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilgrim's”</span> journey the reflections
            of that indivisible One Flame, the aspects of the one eternal
            Spirit, have each the power of action on one of the manifested
            planes of existence—the gradual differentiations from the one
            unmanifested plane—on that plane namely to which it properly
            belongs. Our earth
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg375"></a> affording every Mâyâvic
            condition, it follows that the purified Egotistical Principle, the
            astral and personal Self of an Adept, though forming in reality one
            integral whole with its Highest Self (Âtmâ and Buddhi) may,
            nevertheless, for purposes of universal mercy and benevolence, so
            separate itself from its divine Monad as to lead on this plane of
            illusion and temporary being a distinct independent conscious life
            of its own under a borrowed illusive shape, thus serving at one and
            the same time a double purpose: the exhaustion of its own individual
            Karma, and the saving of millions of human beings less favoured than
            itself from the effects of mental blindness. If asked:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“When the change described as the passage of a Buddha or a
              Jîvanmukta into Nirvâna takes place, where does the original
              consciousness which animated the body continue to reside—in the
              Nirvânî or in the subsequent reincarnations of the latter's
              <span class="tei tei-q">‘remains’</span> (the Nirmânakâya)?”</span>
            the answer is that
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imprisoned</span></em>
            consciousness may be a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“certain knowledge from observation and experience,”</span>
            as Gibbon puts it, but
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disembodied</span></em>
            consciousness is not an effect, but a cause. It is a part of the
            whole, or rather a Ray on the graduated scale of its manifested
            activity, of the one all-pervading, limitless Flame, the reflections
            of which alone can differentiate; and, as such, consciousness is
            ubiquitous, and can be neither localized nor centred on or in any
            particular subject, nor can it be limited. Its effects alone pertain
            to the region of matter, for thought is an energy that affects
            matter in various ways, but consciousness
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, as understood and explained by Occult philosophy, is the highest
            quality of the sentient spiritual principle in us, the Divine Soul
            (or Buddhi) and our Higher Ego, and does not belong to the plane of
            materiality. After the death of the physical man, if he be an
            Initiate, it becomes transformed from a human quality into the
            independent principle itself; the conscious Ego becoming
            Consciousness
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>
            without any Ego, in the sense that the latter can no longer be
            limited or conditioned by the senses, or even by space or time.
            Therefore it is capable, without separating itself from or
            abandoning its possessor, Buddhi, of reflecting itself at the same
            time in its astral man that was, without being under any necessity
            for localizing itself. This is shown at a far lower stage in our
            dreams. For if consciousness can display activity during our
            visions, and while the body and its material brain are fast
            asleep—and if even during those visions it is all but ubiquitous—how
            much greater must be its power when entirely free from, and having
            no more connection with, our physical brain.

            Now the mystery of Buddha lies in this: Gautama, an incarnation of
            pure Wisdom, had yet to learn in His human body and to be initiated
            into the world's secrets like any other mortal, until the day when
            He emerged from His secret recess in the Himâlayas and preached for
            the first time in the grove of Benares. The same with Jesus: from
            the age of twelve to thirty years, when He is found preaching the
            Sermon on the Mount, nothing is positively said or known of Him.
            Gautama had sworn inviolable secrecy as to the Esoteric Doctrines
            imparted to Him. In His immense pity for the ignorance—and as its
            consequence the sufferings—of mankind, desirous though He was to
            keep inviolate His sacred vows, He failed to keep within the
            prescribed limits. While constructing His Esoteric Philosophy (the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye-Doctrine”</span>) on the foundations of
            eternal Truth, He failed to conceal certain dogmas, and trespassing
            beyond the lawful lines, caused those dogmas to be misunderstood. In
            His anxiety to make away with the false Gods, He revealed in the

            His new doctrine, which represented the outward dead body of the
            Esoteric Teaching without its vivifying Soul, had disastrous
            effects: it was never correctly understood, and the doctrine itself
            was rejected by the Southern Buddhists. Immense philanthropy, a
            boundless love and charity for all creatures, were at the bottom of
            His unintentional mistake; but Karma little heeds intentions,
            whether good or bad, if they remain fruitless. If the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Good Law”</span> as preached resulted in
            the most sublime code of ethics and the unparalleled philosophy of
            things external in the visible Kosmos, it biassed and misguided
            immature minds into believing there was nothing more under the
            outward mantle of the system, and its dead-letter only was accepted.
            Moreover, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg 377]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"></a> the new teaching
            unsettled many great minds which had previously followed the

            purposes of Karma and philanthropy, to be reborn. For Him death had

            The shock of death was broken, and like many other Adepts, He threw

            as relics, and began interplanetary life, clothed in His subtle
            body. He was reborn as Shankara, the greatest Vedântic teacher of
            India, whose philosophy—based as it is entirely on the fundamental
            axioms of the eternal Revelation, the Shruti, or the primitive
            Wisdom-Religion, as Buddha from a different point of view had before

            exuberantly veiled metaphysics of the orthodox Brâhmans and those of
            Gautama, which, stripped in their exoteric garb of every
            soul-vivifying hope, transcendental aspiration and symbol, appear in
            their cold wisdom like crystalline icicles, the skeletons of the
            primeval truths of Esoteric Philosophy.

            Was Shankarâchârya Gautama the Buddha, then, under a new personal
            form? It may perhaps only puzzle the reader the more if he be told
            that there was the <span class="tei tei-q">“astral”</span> Gautama
            inside the outward Shankara, whose higher principle, or Âtman, was,
            nevertheless, his own divine prototype—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Light,”</span> indeed—the heavenly,
            mind-born son of Aditi.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            This fact is again based on that mysterious transference of the
            divine ex-personality merged in the impersonal Individuality—now in
            its full trinitarian form of the Monad as Âtmâ-Buddhi-Manas—to a new
            body, whether visible or subjective. In the first case it is a
            Manushya-Buddha; in the second it is a Nirmânakâya. The Buddha is in
            Nirvâna, it is said, though this once mortal vehicle—the subtle
            body—of Gautama is still present among the Initiates; nor will it
            leave the realm of conscious Being so long as suffering mankind
            needs its divine help—not to the end of this Root Race, at any rate.
            From time to time He, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“astral”</span> Gautama, associates Himself,
            in some most mysterious—to
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg378"></a> us quite
            incomprehensible—manner, with Avatâras and great saints, and works

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Thus it is averred that Gautama Buddha was reincarnated in
            Shankarâchârya—that, as is said in

            While the expression in its mystic sense is true, the way of putting
            it may be misleading until explained. Shankara was a Buddha, most
            assuredly, but he never was a reincarnation of the Buddha, though
            Gautama's <span class="tei tei-q">“Astral”</span> Ego—or rather his
            Bodhisattva—may have been associated in some mysterious way with
            Shankarâchârya. Yes, it was perhaps the Ego, Gautama, under a new
            and better adapted casket—that of a Brâhman of Southern India. But
            the Âtman, the Higher Self that overshadowed both, was distinct from
            the Higher Self of the translated Buddha, which was now in Its own
            sphere in Kosmos.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Shankara was an Avatâra in the full sense of the term. According to
            Sayanâchârya, the great commentator on the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, he is to be held as an Avatâra, or direct incarnation of
            Shiva—the Logos, the Seventh Principle in Nature—Himself. In the
            Secret Doctrine Shri Shankarâchârya is regarded as the abode—for the
            thirty-two years of his mortal life—of a Flame, the highest of the
            manifested Spiritual Beings, one of the Primordial Seven Rays.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            And now what is meant by a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Bodhisattva”</span>? Buddhists of the
            Mahâyâna mystic system teach that each
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Buddha</span></span>
            manifests Himself (hypostatically or otherwise) simultaneously in
            three worlds of Being, namely, in the world of Kâma (concupiscence
            or desire—the sensuous universe or our earth) in the shape of a man;
            in the world of Rûpa (form, yet supersensuous) as a Bodhisattva; and
            in the highest Spiritual World (that of purely incorporeal
            existences) as a Dhyâni-Buddha. The latter prevails eternally in
            space and time,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from one Mahâ-Kalpa to the other—the synthetic culmination of the
            three being Âdi-Buddha,<a href="#note_665" id="noteref_665" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a>
            the Wisdom-Principle, which is Absolute, and therefore out of space
            and time. Their inter-relation is the following: The Dhyâni-Buddha,
            when the world needs a human Buddha,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg379"></a>
            <span class="tei tei-q">“creates”</span> through the power of Dhyâna
            (meditation, omnipotent devotion), a mind-born son—a
            Bodhisattva—whose mission it is after the physical death of his
            human, or Manushya-Buddha, to continue his work on earth till the
            appearance of the subsequent Buddha. The Esoteric meaning of this
            teaching is clear. In the case of a simple mortal, the principles in
            him are only the more or less bright reflections of the seven
            cosmic, and the seven celestial Principles, the Hierarchy of
            supersensual Beings. In the case of a Buddha, they are almost the
            principles
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in esse</span></span>
            themselves. The Bodhisattva replaces in him the Kârana Sharira, the
            Ego principle, and the rest correspondingly; and it is in this way
            that Esoteric Philosophy explains the meaning of the sentence that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“by virtue of Dhyâna [or abstract meditation] the Dhyâni-Buddha
              [the Buddha's Spirit or Monad] creates a Bodhisattva,”</span>
            or the astrally clothed Ego within the Manushya-Buddha. Thus, while
            the Buddha merges back into Nirvâna whence it proceeded, the
            Bodhisattva remains behind to continue the Buddha's work upon earth.
            It is then this Bodhisattva that may have afforded the lower
            principles in the apparitional body of Shankarâchârya, the Avatâra.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Now to say that Buddha, after having reached Nirvâna, returned
            thence to reïncarnate in a new body, would be uttering a heresy from
            the Brâhmanical, as well as from the Buddhistic standpoint. Even in
            the Mahâyâna exoteric School in the teaching as to the three
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhic”</span> bodies,<a href="#note_666" id="noteref_666" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a>
            it is said of the Dharmakâya—the ideal formless Being—that once it
            is taken, the Buddha in it abandons the world of sensuous
            perceptions for ever, and has not, nor can he have, any more
            connection with it. To say, as the Esoteric or Mystic School
            teaches, that though Buddha is in Nirvâna he has left behind him the
            Nirmânakâya (the Bodhisattva) to work after him, is quite orthodox
            and in accordance with both the Esoteric Mahâyâna and the Prasanga
            Mâdhyâmika Schools, the latter an anti-esoteric and most
            rationalistic system. For in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kâla Chakra</span></span>
            Commentary it is shown that there is: (1) Âdi-Buddha, eternal and
            conditionless; then (2) come Sambhogakâya-Buddhas, or
            Dhyâni-Buddhas, existing from (æonic) eternity and never
            disappearing—the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Causal</span></em>
            Buddhas so to say; and (3) the Manushya-Bodhisattvas.
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg380"></a> The relation between them
            is determined by the definition given. Âdi-Buddha is Vajradhara, and
            the Dhyâni-Buddhas are Vajrasattva; yet though these two are
            different Beings on their respective planes, They are identical in
            fact, one acting through the other, as a Dhyâni through a human
            Buddha. One is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Endless Intelligence;”</span> the other
            only <span class="tei tei-q">“Supreme Intelligence.”</span> It is

            The Nirvâna of the Buddhists is only the threshold of Paranirvâna,
            according to the Esoteric Teaching: while with the Brâhmans, it is
            the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum bonum</span></span>, that final state from which there is no more return—not till the

            opposed by some too orthodox and dogmatic Philosophers who will not
            accept the Esoteric Doctrine. With them Nirvâna is absolute
            nothingness, in which there is nothing and no one: only an
            unconditioned All. To understand the full characteristics of that

            once attached to Gautama, who was the direct great predecessor of
            Shankara, were naturally attracted to him, the economy of Nature
            forbidding the re-evolution of similar principles from the crude
            state. But it must be remembered that the higher ethereal principles
            are not, like the lower more material ones, visible sometimes to man
            (as astral bodies), and they have to be regarded in the light of
            separate or independent Powers or Gods, rather than as material
            objects. Hence the right way of representing the truth would be to
            say that the various principles, the Bodhisattva, of Gautama Buddha,
            which did not go to Nirvâna, re-united to form the middle principles
            of Shankarâchârya, the earthly Entity.<a href="#note_670" id="noteref_670" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a>

            It is absolutely necessary to study the doctrine of the Buddhas
            esoterically and understand the subtle differences between the
            various planes of existence to be able to comprehend correctly the
            above. Put more clearly, Gautama, the human Buddha, who had,
            exoterically, Amitâbha for his Bodhisattva and Avalokiteshvara for
            his Dhyâni-Buddha—the triad emanating directly from
            Âdi-Buddha—assimilated these by his
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dhyâna”</span> (meditation) and thus become
            a Buddha (<span class="tei tei-q">“enlightened”</span>). In another
            manner this is the case with all men; everyone of us has his
            Bodhisattva—the middle principle, if we hold for a moment to the
            trinitarian division of the septenary group—and his Dhyâni-Buddha,
            or Chohan, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Father of the Son.”</span> Our connecting
            link with the higher Hierarchy of Celestial Beings lies here in a
            nutshell, only we are too sinful to assimilate them.

            Six centuries after the translation of the human Buddha (Gautama)
            another Reformer, as noble and as loving, though less favoured by
            opportunity, arose in another part of the world, among another and a
            less spiritual race. There is a great similarity between the
            subsequent opinions of the world about the two Saviours, the Eastern
            and the Western. While millions became converted to the doctrines of
            the two Masters, the enemies of both—sectarian opponents, the most
            dangerous of all—tore both to shreds by insinuating
            maliciously-distorted statements based on Occult truths, and
            therefore doubly dangerous. While of Buddha it is said by the
            Brâhmans that He was truly an Avatâra of Vishnu, but that He had
            come to tempt the Brâhmans from their faith, and was therefore the
            evil aspect of the God; of Jesus the Bardesanian Gnostics and others
            asserted that He was Nebu, the false Messiah, the destroyer of the
            old orthodox religion.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“He is the founder of a new sect of Nazars,”</span>
            said other sectarians. In Hebrew the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Naba”</span> means
            <span class="tei tei-q">“to speak by inspiration,”</span> (נבא, and
            נבו is Nebo, the God of wisdom). But Nebo is also Mercury, who is
            Buddha in the Hindu monogram of planets. And this is shown by the
            fact that the Talmudists hold that Jesus was inspired by the Genius
            (or Regent) of Mercury confounded by Sir William Jones with Gautama
            Buddha. There are many other strange points of similarity between
            Gautama and Jesus, which cannot be noticed here.<a href="#note_671" id="noteref_671" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a>

            If both the Initiates, aware of the danger of furnishing the
            uncultured masses with the powers acquired by ultimate knowledge,
            left the innermost corner of the sanctuary in profound darkness,
            who, acquainted with human nature, can blame either of them for
            this? Yet although Gautama, actuated by prudence, left the Esoteric
            and most dangerous portions of the Secret Knowledge untold, and
            lived to the ripe old age of eighty—the Esoteric Doctrine says one
            hundred—years, dying with the certainty of having taught its
            essential truths, and of having sown the seeds for the conversion of
            one-third of the world, He yet perhaps revealed more than was
            strictly good for posterity. But Jesus, who had promised His
            disciples the knowledge which confers upon man the power of
            producing <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles”</span> far greater than
            He had ever produced Himself, died, leaving but a few faithful
            disciples—men only half-way to knowledge. They had therefore to
            struggle with a world to which they could impart only what they but
            half-knew themselves, and—no more. In later ages the exoteric
            followers of both
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg383"></a> mangled the truths given
            out, often out of recognition. With regard to the adherents of the
            Western Master, the proof of this lies in the very fact that none of
            them can now produce the promised
            <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles.”</span> They have to choose:
            either it is they who have blundered, or it is their Master who must
            stand arraigned for an empty promise, an uncalled-for boast.<a href="#note_672" id="noteref_672" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a>
            Why such a difference in the destiny of the two? For the Occultist
            this enigma of the unequal favour of Karma or Providence is
            unriddled by the Secret Doctrine.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            It is <span class="tei tei-q">“not lawful”</span> to speak of such
            things publicly, as St. Paul tells us. One more explanation only may
            be given in reference to this subject. It was said a few pages back
            that an Adept who thus sacrifices himself to live, giving up full
            Nirvâna, though he can never lose the knowledge acquired by him in
            previous existences, yet can never rise higher in such borrowed
            bodies. Why? Because he becomes simply the vehicle of a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Light”</span> from a still higher
            sphere, Who being Arûpa, has no personal astral body of His own fit
            for this world. Such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Light,”</span> or Dhyâni-Buddhas,
            are the Dharmakâyas of preceding Manvantaras, who have closed their
            cycles of incarnations in the ordinary sense and who, being thus
            Karmaless, have long ago dropped their individual Rûpas, and have
            become identified with the first Principle. Hence the necessity of a
            sacrificial Nirmânakâya, ready to suffer for the misdeeds or
            mistakes of the new body in its earth-pilgrimage, without any future
            reward on the plane of progression and rebirth, since there are no
            rebirths for him in the ordinary sense. The Higher Self, or Divine
            Monad, is not in such a case attached to the lower Ego; its
            connection is only temporary, and in most cases it acts through
            decrees of Karma. This is a real, genuine sacrifice, the explanation
            of which pertains to the highest Initiation of Gñâna (Occult
            Knowledge). It is closely linked, by a direct evolution of Spirit
            and involution of Matter, with the primeval and great Sacrifice at
            the foundation of the manifested Worlds, the gradual smothering and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg384"></a> death of the spiritual in
            the material. The seed

            Hence in the Purusha Sûkta of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>,<a href="#note_674" id="noteref_674" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">674</span></span></a>
            the mother-fount and source of all subsequent religions, it is
            stated allegorically that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the thousand-headed Purusha”</span> was
            slaughtered at the foundation of the World, that from his remains
            the Universe might arise. This is nothing more nor less than the
            foundation—the seed, truly—of the later many-formed symbol in
            various religions, including Christianity, of the sacrificial lamb.
            For it is a play upon the words.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Aja”</span> (Purusha),
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the unborn,”</span> or eternal Spirit,
            means also <span class="tei tei-q">“lamb,”</span> in Sanskrit.
            Spirit disappears—dies, metaphorically—the more it gets involved in
            matter, and hence the sacrifice of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“unborn,”</span> or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“lamb.”</span>

            chose to make this sacrifice will be plain only to those who, to the
            minute knowledge of His earthly life, add that of a thorough
            comprehension of the laws of Karma. Such occurrences, however,

            As tradition goes, the Brâhmans had committed a heavy sin by
            persecuting Gautama
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Buddha</span></span>
            and His teachings instead of blending and reconciling them with the
            tenets of pure Vaidic Brâhmanism, as was done later by
            Shankarâchârya. Gautama had never gone against the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, only against the exoteric growth of preconceived interpretations.
            The Shruti—divine oral revelation, the outcome of which was the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Veda</span></span>—is eternal. It reached the ear of Gautama Siddartha as it had
            those of the Rishis who had written it down. He accepted the
            revelation, while rejecting the later overgrowth of Brâhmanical
            thought and fancy, and built His doctrines on one and the same basis
            of imperishable truth. As in the case of His Western successor,
            Gautama, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Merciful,”</span> the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Pure,”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Just,”</span> was the first found in the
            Eastern Hierarchy of historical Adepts, if not in the world-annals
            of divine mortals, who was moved by that generous feeling which
            locks the whole of mankind within one embrace, with no petty
            differences of race, birth, or caste. It was He who first enunciated
            that grand and noble principle, and He again who first put it into
            practice. For the sake of the poor and the reviled, the outcast and
            the hapless, invited by Him to the king's festival table, He had
            excluded those who had hitherto sat alone in haughty seclusion and
            selfishness, believing that they would be defiled by the very shadow
            of the disinherited
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg385"></a> ones of the land—and
            these non-spiritual Brâhmans turned against Him for that preference.
            Since then such as these have never forgiven the prince-beggar, the
            son of a king, who, forgetting His rank and station, had flung
            widely open the doors of the forbidden sanctuary to the pariah and
            the man of low estate, thus giving precedence to personal merit over
            hereditary rank or fortune. The sin was theirs—the cause
            nevertheless Himself: hence the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Merciful and the Blessed One”</span> could
            not go out entirely from this world of illusion and created causes
            without atoning for the sin of all—therefore of these Brâhmans also.
            If <span class="tei tei-q">“man afflicted by man”</span> found safe
            refuge with the Tathâgata,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“man afflicting man”</span> had also his
            share in His self-sacrificing, all-embracing and forgiving love. It
            is stated that He desired to atone for the sin of His enemies. Then
            only was He willing to become a full Dharmakâya, a Jivanmukta
            <span class="tei tei-q">“without remains.”</span>

            The close of Shankarâchârya's life brings us face to face with a
            fresh mystery. Shankarâchârya retires to a cave in the Himâlayas,
            permitting none of his disciples to follow him, and disappears
            therein for ever from the sight of the profane. Is he dead?
            Tradition and popular belief answer in the negative, and some of the
            local Gurus, if they do not emphatically corroborate, do not deny
            the rumour. The truth with its mysterious details as given in the
            Secret Doctrine is known but to them; it can be given out fully only
            to the direct followers of the great Dravidian Guru, and it is for
            them alone to reveal of it as much as they think fit. Still it is
            maintained that this Adept of Adepts lives to this day in his
            spiritual entity as a mysterious, unseen, yet overpowering presence
            among the Brotherhood of Shamballa, beyond, far beyond, the

            Philosopher's life, in its dual aspect of public and private
            teacher, the two being contrasted and commented upon. It shows the
            Sage reaching Buddha-hood through a long course of study,
            meditation, and Initiations, as any other Adept would have to do,
            not one rung of the ladder up to the arduous
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Path of Perfection”</span> being missed.
            The Bodhisattva became a Buddha and a Nirvânî through personal
            effort and merit, after having had to undergo all the hardships of
            every other neophyte—not by virtue of a divine birth, as thought by
            some. It was only the reaching of Nirvâna while still living in the
            body and on this earth that was due to His having been in previous
            births high on the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Path of Dzyan”</span> (knowledge, wisdom).
            Mental or intellectual gifts and abstract knowledge follow an
            Initiate in his new birth, but he has to acquire phenomenal powers
            anew, passing through all the successive stages. He has to acquire
            Rinchen-na-dun (<span class="tei tei-q">“the seven precious gifts”</span>)<a href="#note_676" id="noteref_676" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a>
            one after the other. During the period of meditation no worldly
            phenomena on the physical plane must be allowed to enter into his
            mind or cross his thoughts. Zhine-Ihagthong (Sanskrit: Vipashya,
            religious abstract meditation) will develop in him most wonderful
            faculties independently of himself. The four degrees of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg387"></a> contemplation, or Sam-tan
            (Sanskrit: Dhyâna), once acquired, everything becomes easy. For,
            once that man has entirely got rid of the idea of individuality,
            merging his Self in the Universal Self, becoming, so to say, the bar
            of steel to which the properties inherent in the loadstone (Âdi
            Buddha, or Anima Mundi) are imparted, powers hitherto dormant in him
            are awakened, mysteries in invisible Nature are unveiled, and
            becoming a Thonglam-pa (a Seer) he becomes a Dhyâni-Buddha. Every
            Zung (Dhâranî, a mystic word or mantra) of the Lokottaradharma (the
            highest world of causes) will be known to him.

            Vajradhara, also Vajrasattva (Tibetan: Dorjechang and Dorjedzin, or
            Dorjosampa), is the regent or President of all the Dhyân Chohans or
            Dhyâni Buddhas, the highest, the Supreme Buddha; personal, yet never
            manifested objectively; the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Supreme Conqueror,”</span> the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of all Mysteries,”</span> the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“One without Beginning or End”</span>—in
            short, the Logos of Buddhism. For, as Vajrasattva, He is simply the
            Tsovo (Chief) of the Dhyâni Buddhas or Dhyân Chohans, and the
            Supreme Intelligence in the Second World; while as Vajradhara
            (Dorjechang), He is all that which was enumerated above.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“These two are one, and yet two,”</span> and
            over them is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Chang, the Supreme Unmanifested and
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg 388]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg388"></a> Universal Wisdom that
              has no name.”</span>
            As two in one He (They) is the Power that subdued and conquered Evil
            from the beginning, allowing it to reign only over willing subjects
            on earth, and having no power over those who despise and hate it.
            Esoterically the allegory is easily understood; exoterically
            Vajradhara (Vajrasattva) is the God to whom all the evil spirits
            swore that they would not impede the propagation of the Good Law
            (Buddhism), and before whom all the demons tremble. Therefore, we
            say this dual personage has the same
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></span>
            assigned to it in canonical and dogmatic Tibetan Buddhism as have
            Jehovah and the Archangel Mikael, the Metatron of the Jewish
            Kabalists. This is easily shown. Mikael is
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the angel of the face of God,”</span> or he
            who represents his Master.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“My face shall go with thee”</span> (in
            English, <span class="tei tei-q">“presence”</span>), before the
            Israelites, says God to Moses (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodus</span></span>, xxxiii. 14).
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The angel of my presence”</span> (Hebrew:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“of my face”</span>) (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isaiah</span></span>, lxiii. 9), etc. The Roman Catholics identify Christ with Mikael,
            who is also his ferouer, or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“face,”</span> mystically. This is precisely
            the position of Vajradhara, or Vajrasattva, in Northern Buddhism.
            For the latter, in His Higher Self as Vajradhara (Dorjechang), is
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em>
            manifested, except to the seven Dhyân Chohans, the primeval
            Builders. Esoterically, it is the Spirit of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven”</span> collectively, their seventh
            principle, or Âtman. Exoterically, any amount of fables may be found
            in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kâla Chakra</span></span>, the most important work in the Gyut [or (D)gyu] division of the
            Kanjur, the division of mystic knowledge [(D)gyu]. Dorjechang
            (wisdom) Vajradhara, is said to live in the second Arûpa World,
            which connects him with Metatron, in the first world of pure
            Spirits, the Briatic world of the Kabalists, who call this angel
            El-Shaddai, the Omnipotent and Mighty One. Metatron is in Greek
            ἄγγελος (Messenger), or the Great Teacher. Mikael fights Satan, the
            Dragon, and conquers him and his Angels. Vajrasattva, who is one
            with Vajrapâni, the Subduer of the Evil Spirits, conquers Râhu, the
            Great Dragon who is always trying to devour the sun and moon
            (eclipses). <span class="tei tei-q">“War in Heaven”</span> in the
            Christian legend is based upon the bad angels having discovered the
            secrets (magical wisdom) of the good ones (Enoch), and the mystery
            of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Tree of Life.”</span> Let anyone
            read simply the exoteric accounts in the Hindu and Buddhist
            Pantheons—the latter version being taken from the former—and he will
            find both resting on the same primeval, archaic allegory from the
            Secret Doctrine. In the exoteric texts (Hindu and Buddhist), the
            Gods churn the ocean to extract from it the Water of Life—Amrita—or
            the Elixir of Knowledge. In both the Dragon
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg 389]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg389"></a> steals some of this, and
            is exiled from heaven by Vishnu, or Vajradhara, or the chief God,
            whatever may be his name. We find the same in the Book of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enoch</span></span>, and it is poetized in St. John's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revelation</span></span>. And now the allegory, with all its fanciful ornamentations, has
            become a dogma!

            As will be found mentioned later, the Tibetan Lamaseris contain many
            secret and semi-secret volumes, detailing the lives of great Sages.
            Many of the statements in them are purposely confused, and in others
            the reader becomes bewildered, unless a clue be given him, by the

            of teaching. Thus there is a succession of

            taking it for the real body of another elephant, is wiser than the
            man who beholds his face in the stream, and, looking at it, says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Here am I.... I am I”</span>: for the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I,”</span> his Self, is not in the world of
            the twelve Nidânas and mutability, but in that of Non-Being, the
            only world beyond the snares of Mâyâ.... That alone, which has
            neither cause nor author, which is self-existing, eternal, far
            beyond the reach of mutability, is the true
            <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span>

            the four illusions laugh and reply,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily so.”</span> But the truly wise man
            knows that neither man, nor the Universe that he passes through like
            a flitting shadow, is any more a real Universe than the dewdrop that
            reflects a spark of the morning sun is that sun.... There are three
            things, Bhikshus, that are everlastingly the same, upon which no

            Nirvâna, and Space,<a href="#note_691" id="noteref_691" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a>

            and that last one a Mâyâ, so long as man keeps within the whirlpool

          </h1>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The few sentences given in the text from one of Gautama Buddha's
            secret teachings show how uncalled for is the epithet of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Materialist”</span> when applied to One
            Whom two-thirds of those who are looked upon as great Adepts and
            Occultists in Asia recognize as their Master, whether under the name
            of Buddha or that of Shankarâchârya. The reader will remember the
            just-quoted words are what Buddha Sanggyas (or Pho) is alleged by
            the Tibetan Occultists to have taught: there are three eternal
            things in the Universe—the Law, Nirvâna, and Space. The Buddhists of
            the Southern Church claim, on the other hand, that Buddha held only
            two things as eternal—Âkâsha and Nirvâna. But Âkâsha being the same
            as Aditi,<a href="#note_700" id="noteref_700" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>
            and both being translated
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Space,”</span> there is no discrepancy so
            far, since Nirvâna as well as Moksha, is a state. Then in both cases
            the great Kapilavastu Sage unifies the two, as well as the three,
            into one eternal Element, and ends by saying that even
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that One is a Mâyâ”</span> to one who is
            not a Dang-ma, a perfectly purified Soul.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            The whole question hangs upon materialistic misconceptions and
            ignorance of Occult Metaphysics. To the man of Science who regards
            Space as simply a mental representation, a conception of something
            existing
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pro formâ</span></span>, and having no real being outside our mind, Space
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>
            is verily an illusion. He may fill the boundless interstellar space
            with an <span class="tei tei-q">“imaginary”</span> ether,
            nevertheless Space for him is an abstraction. Most of the
            Metaphysicians of Europe are so wide of the mark, from the purely
            Occult standpoint, of a correct comprehension of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Space,”</span> as are the Materialists,
            though the erroneous conceptions of both of course differ widely.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            If, bearing in mind the philosophical views of the Ancients upon
            this question, we compare them with what is now termed exact
            physical Science, it will be found that the two disagree only in
            inferences and names, and that their postulates are the same when
            reduced to their most simple expression. From the beginning of the
            human Æons, from the very dawn of Occult Wisdom, the regions that
            the men of Science fill with ether have been explored by the Seers
            of every age. That which the world regards simply as cosmic Space,
            an abstract representation, the Hindu Rishi, the Chaldæan Magus, the
            Egyptian Hierophant held, each and all, as the one eternal Root of
            all, the playground of all the Forces in Nature. It is the
            fountain-head of all terrestrial life, and the abode of those (to
            us) invisible swarms of existences—of real beings, as of the shadows
            only thereof, conscious and unconscious, intelligent and
            senseless—that surround us on all sides, that interpenetrate the
            atoms of our Kosmos, and see us not, as we do not either see or
            sense them through our physical organisms. For the Occultist
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Space”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Universe”</span> are synonyms. In Space
            there is not Matter, Force, nor Spirit, but all that and much more.
            It is the One Element, and that one the Anima Mundi—Space, Âkâsha,
            Astral Light—the Root of Life which, in its eternal, ceaseless
            motion, like the out- and in-breathing of one boundless ocean,
            evolves but to reabsorb all that lives and feels and thinks and has
            its being in it. As said of the Universe in

            Universal Force, not eternal bliss and rest, but it means literally

            <span class="tei tei-q">“former abode”</span> for the good of
            humanity and His faithful congregation, thus making it incontestable
            that Buddhism does not teach final annihilation, we shall be
            referred to authorities to whom such teaching is ascribed. And let
            us say at once: Men are no authority for us in questions of
            conscience, nor ought they to be for anyone else. If anyone holds to
            Buddha's Philosophy, let him do and say as Buddha did and said; if a
            man calls himself a Christian, let him follow the commandments of
            Christ—not the interpretations of His many dissenting priests and
            sects.

            Annihilation means with the Buddhistical Philosophy only a
            dispersion of matter, in whatever form or
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">semblance</span></em>
            of form it may be, for everything that bears a shape was created,

            seeming to be permanent, it is but an illusion, Mâyâ; for as
            eternity has neither beginning nor end, the more or less prolonged
            duration of some particular form passes, as it were, like an
            instantaneous flash of lightning. Before we have the time to realize
            that we have seen it, it is gone and passed for ever; hence even our
            astral bodies, pure ether, are but illusions of matter so long as
            they retain their terrestrial outline. The latter changes, says the
            Buddhist, according to the merits or demerits of the person during
            his lifetime, and this is
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg404"></a> metempsychosis. When the
            spiritual Entity breaks loose for ever from every particle of
            matter, then only it enters upon the eternal and unchangeable
            Nirvâna. He exists in Spirit, in nothing; as a form, a shape, a
            semblance, he is completely annihilated, and thus will die no more,
            for Spirit alone is no Mâyâ, but the only Reality in an illusionary

            learning that which culminated later on in one or another of the

            1,500 years later; and, finding no room for themselves at the

            The works of the Orientalists are full of the direct landmarks of
            Arhats (Adepts), possessed of thaumaturgic powers, but these are
            spoken of—whenever the subject cannot be avoided—with unconcealed
            scorn. Whether innocently ignorant of, or purposely ignoring, the
            importance of the Occult element and symbology in the various
            Religions they undertake to explain, short work is generally made of
            such passages, and they are left untranslated. In simple justice,
            however, it should be allowed that much as all such miracles may
            have been exaggerated by popular reverence and fancy, they are
            neither less credible nor less attested in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“heathen”</span> annals than are those of
            the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg411"></a> numerous Christian Saints
            in the church chronicles. Both have an equal right to a place in
            their respective histories.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            If, after the beginning of persecution against Buddhism, the Arhats
            were no more heard of in India, it was because, their vows
            prohibiting retaliation, they had to leave the country and seek
            solitude and security in China, Tibet, Japan, and elsewhere. The
            sacerdotal powers of the Brâhmans being at that time unlimited, the
            Simons and Apolloniuses of Buddhism had as much chance of
            recognition and appreciation by the Brâhmanical Irenæuses and
            Tertullians as had their successors in the Judæan and Roman worlds.
            It was a historical rehearsal of the dramas that were enacted
            centuries later in Christendom. As in the case of the so-called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heresiarchs”</span> of Christianity, it was
            not for rejecting the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>
            or the sacred Syllable that the Buddhist Arhats were persecuted, but
            for understanding too well the secret meaning of both. It was simply
            because their knowledge was regarded as dangerous and their presence
            in India unwelcome, that they had to emigrate.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Nor were there a smaller number of Initiates among the Brâhmans
            themselves. Even to-day one meets most wonderfully-gifted Sâddhus
            and Yogîs, obliged to keep themselves unnoticed and in the shadow,
            not only owing to the absolute secresy imposed upon them at their
            Initiation but also for fear of the Anglo-Indian tribunals and
            courts of law, wherein judges are determined to regard as
            charlatanry, imposition, and fraud, the exhibition of, or claim to,
            any abnormal powers, and one may judge of the past by the present.
            Centuries after our era the Initiates of the inner temples and the
            Mathams (monastic communities) chose a superior council, presided
            over by an all-powerful Brahm-Âtmâ, the Supreme Chief of all those
            Mahâtmâs. This pontificate could be exercised only by a Brâhman who
            had reached a certain age, and he it was who was the sole guardian
            of the mystic formula, and he was the Hierophant who created great
            Adepts. He alone could explain the meaning of the sacred word, AUM,
            and of all the religious symbols and rites. And whosoever among
            those Initiates of the Supreme Degree revealed to a profane a single
            one of the truths, even the smallest of the secrets entrusted to
            him, had to die; and he who received the confidence was put to
            death.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            But there existed, and still exists to this day, a Word far
            surpassing the mysterious monosyllable, and which renders him who
            comes into possession of its key nearly the equal of Brahman. The
            Brahmâtmâs alone possess this key, and we know that to this day
            there are two <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg412"></a> great Initiates in
            Southern India who possess it. It can be passed only at death, for
            it is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lost Word.”</span> No torture, no
            human power, could force its disclosure by a Brâhman who knows it;
            and it is well guarded in Tibet.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            Yet this secresy and this profound mystery are indeed disheartening,
            since they alone—the Initiates of India and Tibet—could thoroughly
            dissipate the thick mists hanging over the history of Occultism, and
            force its claims to be recognized. The Delphic injunction,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Know thyself</span></span>,”</span>
            seems for the few in this age. But the fault ought not to be laid at
            the door of the Adepts, who have done all that could be done, and
            have gone as far as Their rules permitted, to open the eyes of the
            world. Only while the European shrinks from public obloquy and the
            ridicule unsparingly thrown on Occultists, the Asiatic is being
            discouraged by his own Pandits. These profess to labour under the
            gloomy impression that no Bîga Vidyâ, no Arhatship (Adeptship), is
            possible during the Kali Yuga (the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Age”</span>) we are now passing
            through. Even the Buddhists are taught that the Lord Buddha is
            alleged to have prophesied that the power would die out in
            <span class="tei tei-q">“one millennium after His death.”</span> But
            this is an entire mistake. In the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dîgha Nikâya</span></span>
            the Buddha says:

            A similar contradiction of the view brought forward by the Brâhmans
            is made by Krishna in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavad Gîtâ</span></span>, and there is further the actual appearance of many Sâddhus and
            miracle-workers in the past, and even in the present age. The same
            holds good for China and Tibet. Among the commandments of
            Tsong-Kha-pa there is one that enjoins the Rahats (Arhats) to make
            an attempt to enlighten the world, including the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“white barbarians,”</span> every century, at
            a certain specified period of the cycle. Up to the present day none
            of these attempts has been very successful. Failure has followed
            failure. Have we to explain the fact by the light of a certain
            prophecy? It is said that up to the time when Pban-chhen-rin-po-chhe
            (the Great Jewel of Wisdom)<a href="#note_732" id="noteref_732" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a>

            and appearing as the Spiritual Conqueror (Chom-den-da), destroys the
            errors and ignorance of the ages, it will be of little use to try to
            uproot the misconceptions
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg413"></a> of P'heling-pa (Europe):
            her sons will listen to no one. Another prophecy declares that the
            Secret Doctrine shall remain in all its purity in Bhod-yul (Tibet),
            only to the day that it is kept free from foreign invasion. The very
            visits of Western natives, however friendly, would be baneful to the
            Tibetan populations. This is the true key to Tibetan exclusiveness.

            Notwithstanding widespread misconceptions and errors—often most
            amusing to one who has a certain knowledge of the true
            doctrines—about Buddhism generally, and especially about Buddhism in
            Tibet, all the Orientalists agree that the Buddha's foremost aim was
            to lead human beings to salvation by teaching them to practise the
            greatest purity and virtue, and by detaching them from the service
            of this illusionary world, and the love of one's still more
            illusionary—because so evanescent and unreal—body and physical self.
            And what is the good of a virtuous life, full of privations and
            suffering, if the only result of it is to be annihilation at the
            end? If even the attainment of that supreme perfection which leads
            the Initiate to remember the whole series of his past lives, and to
            foresee that of the future ones, by the full development of that
            inner, divine eye in him, and to acquire the knowledge that unfolds
            the causes<a href="#note_733" id="noteref_733" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a>
            of the ever-recurring cycles of existence, brings him finally to
            non-being, and nothing more—then the whole system is idiotic, and
            Epicureanism is far more philosophical than
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such</span></em>
            Buddhism. He who is unable to comprehend the subtle, and yet so
            potent, difference between existence in a material or physical state
            and a purely spiritual existence—Spirit or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul-life”</span>—will never appreciate at
            their full value the grand teachings of the Buddha, even in their
            exoteric form. Individual or personal existence is the cause of
            pains and sorrows; collective and impersonal life-eternal is full of
            divine bliss and joy for ever, with neither causes nor effects to
            darken its light. And the hope for such a life-eternal is the
            keynote of the whole of Buddhism. If we are told that impersonal
            existence is no existence at all, but amounts to annihilation, as
            was maintained by some French reincarnationists, then we would ask:
            What difference can it
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page415">[pg 415]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg415"></a> make in the spiritual
            perceptions of an Ego whether he enter Nirvâna loaded with the
            recollections only of his own personal lives—tens of thousands
            according to the modern reincarnationists—or whether, merged
            entirely in the Parabrâhmic state it becomes one with the All, with
            the absolute knowledge and the absolute feeling of representing
            collective humanities? Once that an Ego lives only ten distinct
            individual lives he must necessarily lose his one self, and become
            mixed up—merged, so to say—with these ten selves. It really seems
            that so long as this great mystery remains a dead-letter to the
            world of Western thinkers, and especially to the Orientalists, the
            less the latter undertake to explain it the better for Truth.

            Of all the existing religious Philosophies, Buddhism is the least
            understood. The Lassens, Webers, Wassiljows, the Burnoufs and
            Juliens, and even such
            <span class="tei tei-q">“eye-witnesses”</span> of Tibetan Buddhism
            as Csoma de Köros and the Schlagintweits, have hitherto only added
            perplexity to confusion. None of these has ever received his
            information from a genuine Gelugpa source: all have judged Buddhism
            from the bits of knowledge picked up at Tibetan frontier lamaseries,
            in countries thickly populated by Bhutanese and Leptchas, Bhons, and
            red-capped Dugpas, along the line of the Himâlayas. Hundreds of
            volumes purchased from Burats, Shamans, and Chinese Buddhists, have
            been read and translated, glossed and misinterpreted according to
            invariable custom. Esoteric Schools would cease to be worthy of
            their name were their literature and doctrines to become the
            property of even their profane co-religionists—still less of the
            Western public. This is simple common-sense and logic. Nevertheless
            this is a fact which our Orientalists have ever refused to
            recognize: hence they have gone on, gravely discussing the relative
            merits and absurdities of idols,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“sooth-saying tables,”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“magical figures of Phurbu”</span> on the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“square tortoise.”</span> None of these have
            anything to do with the real philosophical Buddhism of the Gelugpa,
            or even of the most educated among the Sakyapa and Kadampa sects.
            All such <span class="tei tei-q">“plates”</span> and sacrificial
            tables, Chinsreg magical circles, etc., were avowedly got from
            Sikkhim, Bhutan, and Eastern Tibet, from Bhons and Dugpas.
            Nevertheless, these are given as characteristics of Tibetan
            Buddhism! It would be as fair to judge the unread Philosophy of
            Bishop Berkeley after studying Christianity in the clown-worship of
            Neapolitan lazzaroni, dancing a mystic jig before the idol of St.

            the Buddha convey a double meaning, and every sect has gradually
            come to claim to be the only one knowing the correct meaning, and
            thus to assume supremacy over the rest. Schism has crept in, and has
            fastened, like a hideous cancer, on the fair body of early Buddhism.
            Nâgârjuna's Mahâyâna (<span class="tei tei-q">“Great Vehicle”</span>) School was opposed by the Hînayâna (or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Little Vehicle”</span>) System, and even
            the Yogâchârya of Âryâsanga became disfigured by the yearly
            pilgrimage from India to the shores of Mansarovara, of hosts of
            vagabonds with matted locks who play at being Yogîs and Fakirs,
            preferring this to work. An affected detestation of the world, and
            the tedious and useless practice of the counting of inhalations and
            exhalations as a means to produce absolute tranquillity of mind or
            meditation, have brought this school within the region of Hatha
            Yoga, and have made it heir to the Brâhmanical Tîrthikas. And though
            its Srotâpatti, its Sakridâgâmin, Anâgâmin, and Arhats,<a href="#note_734" id="noteref_734" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a>
            bear the same names in almost every school, yet the doctrines of
            each differ greatly, and none of these is likely to gain real
            Abhijñâs (the supernatural abnormal five powers).

            One of the chief mistakes of the Orientalists when judging on
            <span class="tei tei-q">“internal (?) evidence,”</span> as they
            express it, was that they assumed that the Pratyeka Buddhas, the
            Bodhisattvas, and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect”</span> Buddhas were a later
            development of Buddhism. For on these three chief degrees are based
            the seven and twelve degrees of the Hierarchy of Adeptship. The
            first are those who have attained the Bodhi (wisdom) of the Buddhas,
            but do not become Teachers.<a href="#note_735" id="noteref_735" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a>
            The human Bodhisattvas are candidates, so to say, for perfect
            Buddhaship (in Kalpas to come), and with the option of using their
            powers now if need be. <span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect”</span>
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg 417]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg417"></a> Buddhas are simply
            <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect”</span> Initiates. All these are
            men, and not disembodied Beings, as is given out in the Hînayâna
            exoteric books. Their correct character may be found only in the
            secret volumes of Lugrub or Nâgârjuna, the founder of the Mahâyâna
            system, who is said to have been initiated by the Nâgas (fabulous
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Serpents,”</span> the veiled name for an
            Initiate or Mahâtmâ). The fabled report found in Chinese records
            that Nâgârjuna considered his doctrine to be in opposition to that
            of Gautama Buddha, until he discovered from the Nâgas that it was
            precisely the doctrine that had been secretly taught by Shâkyamuni
            Himself, is an allegory, and is based upon the reconciliation
            between the old Brâhmanical secret Schools in the Himâlayas and
            Gautama's Esoteric teachings, both parties having at first objected
            to the rival schools of the other. The former, the parent of all
            others, had been established beyond the Himâlayas for ages before
            the appearance of Shâkyamuni. Gautama was a pupil of this; and it
            was with them, those Indian Sages, that He had learned the truths of
            the Sungata, the emptiness and impermanence of every terrestrial,
            evanescent thing, and the mysteries of Prajñâ Pâramitâ, or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“knowledge across the River,”</span> which
            finally lands the <span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect One”</span> in
            the regions of the One Reality. But His Arhats were not Himself.
            Some of them were ambitious, and they modified certain teachings
            after the great councils, and it is on account of these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“heretics”</span> that the Mother-School at
            first refused to allow them to blend their schools, when persecution
            began driving away the Esoteric Brotherhood from India. But when
            finally most of them submitted to the guidance and control of the
            chief Âshrams, then the Yogâchârya of Âryâsanga was merged into the
            oldest Lodge. For it is
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>
            from time immemorial that has lain concealed the final hope and
            light of the world, the salvation of mankind. Many are the names of
            that School and land, the name of the latter being now regarded by
            the Orientalists as the mythic name of a fabulous country. It is
            from this mysterious land, nevertheless, that the Hindu expects his
            Kalki Avatâra, the Buddhist his Maitreya, the Pârsî his Sosiosh, and
            the Jew his Messiah, and so would the Christian expect thence his
            Christ—if he only knew of it.

            seemingly still in the body, every inhabitant thereof being a

            being transformed into conditionless Reality, and the realities of
            this, our world, having vanished in their own nature into thin
            (non-existing) air. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Absolute Truth”</span> (Dondam-pay-den-pa;

            phraseology Svasamvedanâ (<span class="tei tei-q">“self-analyzing reflection”</span>) and Paramârtha, or that absolute consciousness of the personal
            merged into the impersonal Ego, which is above all, hence above
            illusion in every sense. Its

            the dull perceptions of the European profane. What matters it to
            Those who, being in this world, yet live outside and far beyond our
            illusive earth! Above Them there is but one class of Nirvânîs,

            Most of the doctrines contained in the Yogâchârya, or Mahâyâna
            systems are Esoteric, like the rest. One day the profane Hindu and

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>

            and already there have been made some attempts in this direction, so
            that the tables may then be cruelly turned on the Christians.
            Whatever conclusions the two may arrive at, they will never be half

            can never be contrasted for one moment with some of the nihilistic
            or materialistic schools of India, such as the Chârvâka. They are
            pure Vedântins—if anything—in their views. And if the Yogâchâryas
            may be compared with, or called the Tibetan Vishishtadwaitîs, the
            Prasanga School is surely the Adwaita Philosophy of the land. It was
            divided into two: one was originally founded by Bhavya, the
            Svantatra Madhyamika School, and the other by Buddhapâlita; both
            have their exoteric and esoteric divisions. It is necessary to
            belong to the latter to know anything of the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg420"></a> esoteric doctrines of
            that sect, the most metaphysical and philosophical of all.
            Chandrakirti (Dava Dagpa) wrote his commentaries on the Prasanga
            doctrines and taught publicly; and he expressly states that there
            are two ways of entering the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Path”</span> to Nirvâna. Any virtuous man
            can reach by Naljorngonsum (<span class="tei tei-q">“meditation by self-perception”</span>), the intuitive comprehension of the four Truths, without either
            belonging to a monastic order or having been initiated. In this case
            it was considered as a heresy to maintain that the visions which may
            arise in consequence of such meditation, or Vishnâ (internal
            knowledge), are not susceptible of errors (Namtog or false visions),
            for they are. Alaya alone having an absolute and eternal existence,
            can alone have absolute knowledge; and even the Initiate, in his
            Nirmânakâya<a href="#note_744" id="noteref_744" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">744</span></span></a>
            body may commit an occasional mistake in accepting the false for the
            true in his explorations of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Causeless”</span> World. The Dharmakâya
            Bodhisattva is alone infallible, when in real Samâdhi. Âlaya, or
            Nying-po, being the root and basis of all, invisible and
            incomprehensible to human eye and intellect, it can reflect only its
            reflection—not Itself. Thus that reflection will be mirrored like
            the moon in tranquil and clear water only in the passionless
            Dharmakâya intellect, and will be distorted by the flitting image of
            everything perceived in a mind that is itself liable to be
            disturbed.
          </p>
          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
            In short, this doctrine is that of the Râj-Yoga in its practice of
            the two kinds of the Samâdhi state; one of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Paths”</span> leading to the sphere of
            bliss (Sukhâvatî or Devachan), where man enjoys perfect, unalloyed
            happiness, but is yet still connected with personal existence; and
            the other the Path that leads to entire emancipation from the worlds
            of illusion, self, and unreality. The first one is open to all and
            is reached by merit simply; the second—a hundredfold more rapid—is
            reached through knowledge (Initiation). Thus the followers of the
            Prasanga School are nearer to Esoteric Buddhism than are the
            Yogâchâryas; for their views are those of the most secret Schools,
            and only the echo of these doctrines is heard in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yamyangshapda</span></span>
            and other works in public circulation and use. For instance, the
            unreality of two out of the three divisions of time is given in

            offered by Abbé Huc—that Tsong-Kha-pa derived his wisdom and
            acquired his extraordinary powers from his intercourse with a

            however, who were the five foreigners who appeared in Tibet in the
            year 371 of our era, to disappear as suddenly and mysteriously as
            they came, after leaving with King Thothori-Nyang-tsan instructions

            There is generally a hopeless confusion about Eastern dates among
            European scholars, but nowhere is this so great as in the case of
            Tibetan Buddhism. Thus, while some, correctly enough, accept the
            seventh century as the date of the introduction of Buddhism, there
            are others—such as Lassen and Koeppung, for instance—who show on
            good authority, the one, the construction of a Buddhist monastery on
            the slopes of the Kailas Range so far back as the year 137

            The difference though trifling—only just one thousand years—is
            nevertheless puzzling. But even this is easily explained on Esoteric
            grounds. Buddhism—the veiled Esotericism of Buddha—was established
            and took root in the seventh century of the Christian era; while
            true Esoteric Buddhism, or the kernel, the very spirit of
            Tathâgata's doctrines, was brought to the place of its birth, the
            cradle of humanity, by the chosen Arhats of Buddha, who were sent to

            an Esoteric Doctrine—enshrined like a pearl within the shell of

            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mystery of the Eye,”</span> would show
            the absence of any Esotericism. Had the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heart”</span> stood in its place, then it
            would have meant what it now only professes to convey. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye Doctrine”</span> means dogma and
            dead-letter form, church ritualism intended for those who are
            content with exoteric formulæ. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heart Doctrine,”</span> or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heart's Seal”</span> (the Sin Yin), is the
            only real one. This may be found corroborated by Hiuen Tsang.

            hidden meaning, the cold metaphysics and the Divine Wisdom—is
            clearly demonstrated in several volumes on
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Chinese Buddhism,”</span> written by sundry
            missionaries. Having lived for years in China, they still know no
            more than they have learned from pretentious schools calling
            themselves esoteric, yet freely supplying the open enemies of their
            faith with professedly ancient manuscripts and esoteric works! This
            ludicrous contradiction between profession and practice has never,
            as it seems, struck any of the western and reverend historians of
            other peoples' secret tenets. Thus many esoteric schools are

                  resurrection [rebirth], such a life will bring a good name and

            </h2>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              There is a strange law in Occultism which has been ascertained and
              proven by thousands of years of experience; nor has it failed to
              demonstrate itself, almost in every case, during the years that
              the Theosophical Society has been in existence. As soon as anyone
              pledges himself as a
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Probationer,”</span> certain Occult
              effects ensue. Of these the first is the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">throwing outward</span></em>
              of everything latent in the nature of the man; his faults, habits,
              qualities or subdued desires, whether good, bad or indifferent.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              For instance, if a man be vain or a sensualist, or ambitious,
              whether by atavism or by karmic heirloom, those vices are sure to
              break out, even if he has hitherto successfully concealed and
              repressed them. They will come to the front irrepressibly, and he
              will have to fight a hundred times harder than before, until he
              kills all such tendencies in himself.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              On the other hand, if he be good, generous, chaste and abstemious,
              or has any virtue hitherto latent and concealed in him, it will
              work its way out as irrepressibly as the rest. Thus a civilized
              man who hates to be considered a saint, and therefore assumes a
              mask, will not be able to conceal his true nature, whether base or
              noble.
            </p>

              Its action is the more marked, the more earnest and sincere the
              desire of the candidate, and the more deeply he has felt the
              reality and importance of his pledge.

              The ancient occult axiom,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Know Thyself,”</span> must be familiar to
              every student; but few if any have apprehended the real meaning of
              this wise exhortation of the Delphic Oracle. You all know your
              earthly pedigree, but who of you has ever traced all the links of
              heredity, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"></a> astral, psychic and
              spiritual, which go to make you what you are? Many have written
              and expressed their desire to unite themselves with their Higher
              Ego, yet none seem to know the indissoluble link connecting their
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Higher Egos”</span> with the One
              Universal
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Self</span></span>.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              For all purposes of Occultism, whether practical or purely
              metaphysical, such knowledge is absolutely requisite. It is
              proposed, therefore, to begin these papers by showing this
              connection in all directions with the worlds: Absolute,
              Archetypal, Spiritual, Mânasic, Psychic, Astral, and Elemental.
              Before, however, we can touch upon the higher worlds—Archetypal,
              Spiritual and Mânasic—we must master the relations of the seventh,
              the terrestrial world, the lower Prakriti, or Malkuth as in the
              Kabalah, to the worlds or planes which immediately follow it.

              says the Âryan Adept, the son of the Fifth Race, who with this
              syllable begins and ends his salutation to the human being, his
              conjuration of, or appeal to, non-human
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Presences</span></span>.

              murmurs the Turanian Adept, the descendant of the Fourth Race; and
              after pausing he adds,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Padme-Hum</span></span>.”</span>
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              This famous invocation is very erroneously translated by the
              Orientalists as meaning,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh the Jewel in the Lotus.”</span> For
              although, literally,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Om</span></span>
              is a syllable sacred to the Deity,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Padme</span></span>
              means <span class="tei tei-q">“in the Lotus,”</span> and
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mani</span></span>
              is any precious stone, still neither the words themselves, nor
              their symbolical meaning, are thus really correctly rendered.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In this, the most sacred of all Eastern formulas, not only has
              every syllable a secret potency producing a definite result, but
              the whole invocation has seven different meanings and can produce
              seven distinct results, each of which may differ from the others.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The seven meanings and the seven results depend upon the
              intonation which is given to the whole formula and to each of its
              syllables; and even the numerical value of the letters is added to
              or diminished according as such or another rhythm is made use of.
              Let the student remember that number underlies form, and number
              guides sound. Number lies at the root of the manifested Universe:
              numbers and harmonious proportions guide the first
              differentiations of homogeneous substance into heterogeneous
              elements; and number and numbers set limits to the formative hand
              of Nature.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Know the corresponding numbers of the fundamental principle of
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg437"></a> every element and its
              sub-elements, learn their interaction and behaviour on the occult
              side of manifesting Nature, and the law of correspondences will
              lead you to the discovery of the greatest mysteries of
              macrocosmical life.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              But to arrive at the macrocosmical, you must begin by the
              microcosmical,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, you must study
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Man</span></span>, the microcosm—in this case as physical science
              does—inductively, proceeding from particulars to universals. At
              the same time, however, since a key-note is required to analyze
              and comprehend any combination of differentiations of sound, we
              must never lose sight of the Platonic method, which starts with
              one general view of all, and descends from the universal to the
              individual. This is the method adopted in Mathematics—the only
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exact</span></em>
              science that exists in our day.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Let us study Man, therefore; but if we separate him for one moment
              from the Universal Whole, or view him in isolation, from a single
              aspect, apart from the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Man”</span>—the Universe
              symbolized by Adam Kadmon or his equivalents in every
              Philosophy—we shall either land in Black Magic or fail most
              ingloriously in our attempt.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Thus the mystic sentence,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Om Mani Padme Hum</span></span>,”</span>
              when rightly understood, instead of being composed of the almost
              meaningless words,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh the Jewel in the Lotus,”</span>
              contains a reference to this indissoluble union between Man and
              the Universe, rendered in seven different ways, and having the
              capability of seven different applications to as many planes of
              thought and action.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              From whatever aspect we examine it, it means:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“I am that I am”</span>:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“I am in thee and thou art in me.”</span>
              In this conjunction and close union the good and pure man becomes
              a God. Whether consciously or unconsciously, he will bring about,
              or innocently cause to happen, unavoidable results. In the first
              case, if an Initiate (of course an Adept of the Right-hand Path
              alone is meant), he can guide a beneficent or a protecting
              current, and thus benefit and protect individuals and even whole
              nations. In the second case, although quite unaware of what he is
              doing, the good man becomes a shield to whomsoever he is with.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Such is the fact; but its how and why have to be explained, and
              this can be done only when the actual presence and potency of
              numbers in sounds, and hence in words and letters, have been
              rendered clear. The formula,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Om Mani Padme Hum</span></span>,”</span>
              has been chosen as an illustration on account of its almost
              infinite potency in the mouth of an Adept, and
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg 438]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg438"></a> of its potentiality
              when pronounced by any man. Be careful, all you who read this: do
              not use these words in vain, or when in anger, lest you become
              yourself the first sacrificial victim, or, what is worse, endanger
              those whom you love.
            </p>

              The profane Orientalist, who all his life skims mere externals,
              will tell you flippantly, and laughing at the superstition, that
              in Tibet this sentence is the most powerful six-syllabled
              incantation and is said to have been delivered to the nations of
              Central Asia by Padmapâni, the Tibetan Chenresi.<a href="#note_767" id="noteref_767" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a>
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              But who is Padmapâni, in reality? Each of us must recognize him
              for himself, whenever he is ready. Each of us has within himself
              the <span class="tei tei-q">“Jewel in the Lotus,”</span> call it
              Padmapâni, Krishna, Buddha, Christ, or whatever name we may give
              to our Divine Self. The exoteric story runs thus:
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The supreme Buddha, or Amitâbha, they say, at the hour of the
              creation of man, caused a rosy ray of light to issue from his
              right eye. The ray emitted a sound and became Padmapâni
              Bodhisattva. Then the Deity allowed to stream forth from his left
              eye a blue ray of light, which, becoming incarnate in the two
              virgins Dolma, acquired the power to enlighten the minds of living
              beings. Amitâbha then called the combination, which forthwith took
              up its abode in man,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Om Mani Padme Hum</span></span>,”</span>
              <span class="tei tei-q">“I am the Jewel in the Lotus and in it I will remain.”</span>
              Then Padmapâni,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the One in the Lotus”</span> vowed never
              to cease working until he had made Humanity feel his presence in
              itself and had thus saved it from the misery of rebirth. He vowed
              to perform the feat before the end of the Kalpa, adding that, in
              case of failure, he wished that his head should split into
              numberless fragments. The Kalpa closed; but Humanity felt him not
              within its cold, evil heart. Then Padmapâni's head split and was
              shattered into a thousand fragments. Moved with compassion, the
              Deity re-formed the pieces into
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em>
              heads, three white, and seven of various colours. And since that
              day man has become a perfect number, or
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ten</span></span>.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In this allegory the potency of
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sound</span></span>,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Colour</span></span>, and
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Number</span></span>
              is so ingeniously introduced as to veil the real Esoteric meaning.
              To the outsider it reads like one of the many meaningless
              fairy-tales of creation; but it is pregnant with spiritual and
              divine, physical and magical meaning. From Amitâbha—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no colour</span></em>, or the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">white glory</span></em>—are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg439"></a> born the seven
              differentiated colours of the prism. These each emit a
              corresponding sound, forming the seven of the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">musical scale</span></em>. As Geometry, among the Mathematical Sciences, is specially
              related to Architecture, and also (proceeding to Universals) to
              Cosmogony, so the ten Jods of the Pythagorean Tetrad, or
              Tetraktys, being made to symbolize the Macrocosm, the Microcosm,
              or man, its image, had also to be divided into ten points. For
              this Nature herself has provided, as will be seen.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              But before this statement can be proved and the perfect
              correspondences between the Macrocosm and the Microcosm
              demonstrated, a few words of explanation are necessary.

              To the learner who would study the Esoteric Sciences with their
              double object: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) of proving Man to be identical in spiritual and physical
              essence with both the Absolute Principle and with God in Nature;
              and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) of demonstrating the presence in him of the same potential
              powers as exist in the creative forces in Nature—to such a one a
              perfect knowledge of the correspondences between Colours, Sounds,
              and Numbers is the first requisite. As already said, the sacred
              formula of the far East,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Om Mani Padme Hum</span></span>,”</span>
              is the one best calculated to make these correspondential
              qualities and functions clear to the learner.

              In the allegory of Padmapâni, the Jewel (or Spiritual Ego) in the

              as synthesizing the

              <span class="tei tei-q">“principles”</span>? This is the reason
              why the perfect number ten is divided into two: in their
              completeness,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, super-spiritually and physically, the forces are
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ten</span></span>: to wit, three on the subjective and inconceivable, and seven on
              the objective plane. Bear in mind that I am now giving you the
              description of the two opposite poles: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the primordial Triangle, which, as soon as it has reflected
              itself in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Man,”</span> the
              highest of the lower seven—disappears, returning into
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Silence and Darkness”</span>; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) the astral paradigmatic man, whose Monad (Âtmâ) is also
              represented by a triangle, as it has to become a ternary in
              conscious Devachanic interludes. The purely terrestrial man being
              reflected in the universe of Matter, so to say, upside down, the
              upper Triangle, wherein the creative ideation and the subjective
              potentiality of the formative faculty resides,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg 445]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg445"></a> is shifted in the man
              of clay below the seven. Thus three of the ten, containing in the
              archetypal world only ideative and paradigmatical potentiality,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, existing in possibility, not in action, are in fact one. The
              potency of formative creation resides in the Logos, the synthesis
              of the seven Forces or Rays, which becomes forthwith the
              Quaternary, the sacred Tetraktys. This process is repeated in man,
              in whom the lower physical triangle becomes, in conjunction with
              the female One, the male-female creator, or generator. The same on
              a still lower plane in the animal world. A mystery above, a
              mystery below, truly.

              In this diagram, we see that physical man (or his body) does not
              share in the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">direct</span></em>
              pure waves of the divine Essence which flows from the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One in Three</span></em>, the Unmanifested, through the Manifested Logos (the upper face
              in the diagram). Purusha, the primeval Spirit, touches the human
              head and stops there. But the Spiritual Man (the synthesis of the
              seven principles) is directly connected with it. And here a few
              words ought to be said about the usual exoteric enumeration of the
              principles. At first an approximate division only was made and
              given out.
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>
              begins with Âtmâ, the seventh, and ends with the Physical Body,
              the first. Now neither Âtmâ, which is no individual
              <span class="tei tei-q">“principle,”</span> but a radiation
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from</span></em>
              and
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one with</span></em>
              the Unmanifested Logos; nor the Body, which is the material rind,
              or shell, of the Spiritual Man, can be, in strict truth, referred
              to as <span class="tei tei-q">“principles.”</span> Moreover, the
              chief <span class="tei tei-q">“principle”</span> of all, one not
              even mentioned heretofore, is the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Luminous Egg”</span> (Hiranyagarbha), or
              the invisible magnetic sphere in which every man is enveloped.<a href="#note_773" id="noteref_773" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a>
              It is the direct emanation: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) from the Âtmic Ray in its triple aspect of Creator, Preserver
              and Destroyer (Regenerator); and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) from Buddhi-Manas. The
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em>
              aspect of this individual Aura is the faculty of assuming the form
              of its body and becoming the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Radiant,”</span> the Luminous Augoeides.
              It is this, strictly speaking, which at times becomes the form
              called Mâyâvi Rûpa. Therefore, as explained in the second face of
              the diagram (the astral man), the Spiritual Man consists of only
              five <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg446"></a> principles, as taught
              by the Vedântins,<a href="#note_774" id="noteref_774" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a>
              who substitute, tacitly, for the physical this sixth, or Auric,
              Body, and merge the dual Manas (the dual mind, or consciousness)
              into one. Thus they speak of five Koshas (sheaths or principles),
              and call Âtmâ the sixth yet no
              <span class="tei tei-q">“principle.”</span> This is the secret of
              the late Subba Row's criticism of the division in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>. But let the student now learn the true Esoteric enumeration.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The reason why public mention of the Auric Body was not permitted
              was on account of its being so sacred. It is this Body which, at
              death, assimilates the essence of Buddhi and Manas and becomes the
              vehicle of these spiritual principles,
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which are not objective</span></em>, and then, with the full radiation of Âtmâ upon it ascends as
              Manas-Taijasi into the Devachanic state. Therefore is it called by
              many names. It is the Sûtrâtmâ, the silver
              <span class="tei tei-q">“thread”</span> which
              <span class="tei tei-q">“incarnates”</span> from the beginning of
              Manvantara to the end, stringing upon itself the pearls of human
              existence, in other words, the spiritual aroma of every
              personality it
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">follows</span></em>
              through the pilgrimage of life.<a href="#note_775" id="noteref_775" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a>
              It is also the material from which the Adept forms his Astral
              Bodies, from the Augoeides and the Mâyâvi Rûpa downwards. After
              the death of man, when its most ethereal particles have drawn into
              themselves the spiritual principles of Buddhi and the Upper Manas,
              and are illuminated with the radiance of Âtmâ, the Auric Body
              remains either in the Devachanic state of consciousness, or, in
              the case of a full Adept, prefers the state of a Nirmânakâya, that
              is, one who has so purified his whole system that he is above even
              the divine illusion of a Devachanî. Such an Adept remains in the
              astral (invisible) plane connected with our earth, and henceforth
              moves and lives in the possession of all his principles except the
              Kâma Rûpa and Physical Body. In the case of the Devachanî, the
              Linga Sharîra—the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alter ego</span></em>
              of the body, which during life is within the physical envelope
              while the radiant aura is without—strengthened by the material
              particles which this aura leaves behind, remains close to the dead
              body and outside it, and soon fades away. In the case of the full
              Adept, the body alone becomes subject to dissolution, while the
              centre of that force which was the seat of desires and passions,
              disappears with its cause—the animal body. But during the life of
              the latter all these centres are more or less active and in
              constant correspondence
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg447"></a> with their prototypes,
              the cosmic centres, and their microcosms, the principles. It is
              only through these cosmic and spiritual centres that the physical
              centres (the upper seven orifices and the lower triad) can benefit
              by their Occult interaction, for these orifices, or openings, are
              channels conducting into the body the influences that
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the will of man</span></em>
              attracts and uses,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, the cosmic forces.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              This will has, of course, to act primarily through the spiritual
              principles. To make this clearer, let us take an example. In order
              to stop pain, let us say in the right eye, you have to attract to
              it the potent magnetism from that cosmic principle which
              corresponds to this eye and also to Buddhi. Create, by a powerful
              will effort, an imaginary line of communication between the right
              eye and Buddhi, locating the latter as a
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">centre</span></em>
              in the same part of the head. This line, though you may call it
              <span class="tei tei-q">“imaginary,”</span> is, once you succeed
              in seeing it with your mental eye and give it a shape and colour,
              in truth as good as real. A rope in a dream
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not</span></em>
              and yet
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>. Moreover, according to the prismatic colour with which you
              endow your line, so will the influence act. Now Buddhi and Mercury
              correspond with each other, and both are yellow, or radiant and
              golden coloured. In the human system, the right eye corresponds
              with Buddhi and Mercury; and the left with Manas and Venus or
              Lucifer. Thus, if your line is golden or silvery, it will stop the
              pain; if red, it will increase it, for red is the colour of Kâma
              and corresponds with Mars. Mental or Christian Scientists have
              stumbled upon the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effects</span></em>
              without understanding the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em>. Having found by chance the secret of producing such results
              owing to mental abstraction, they attribute them to their union
              with God (whether a personal or impersonal God they know best),
              whereas it is simply the effect of one or another principle.
              However it may be, they are on the path of discovery, although
              they must remain wandering for a long time to come.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Let not Esoteric students commit the same mistake. It has often
              been explained that neither the cosmic planes of substance nor
              even the human principles—with the exception of the lowest
              material plane or world and the physical body, which, as has been
              said, are no <span class="tei tei-q">“principles,”</span>—can be
              located or thought of as being in Space and Time. As the former
              are seven in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>, so are we seven in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>—that same absolute Soul of the World, which is both Matter and
              non-Matter, Spirit and non-Spirit, Being and non-Being. Impress
              yourselves well with this idea, all those of you who would study
              the mysteries of
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Self</span></span>.

              Remember that with our physical senses alone at our command, none
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg 448]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg448"></a> of us can hope to reach
              beyond gross Matter. We can do so only through one or another of
              our seven
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em>
              senses, either by training, or if one is a born Seer. Yet even a
              clairvoyant possessed of such faculties, if not an Adept, no
              matter how honest and sincere he may be, will, through his
              ignorance of the truths of Occult Science, be led by the visions
              he sees in the Astral Light only to mistake for God or Angels the
              denizens of those spheres of which he may occasionally catch a
              glimpse, as witness Swedenborg and others.

              These seven senses of ours correspond with every other septenate
              in nature and in ourselves. Physically, though invisibly, the
              human Auric Envelope (the amnion of the physical man in every age
              of life) has seven layers, just as Cosmic Space and our physical
              epidermis have. It is this Aura which, according to our mental and
              physical state of purity or impurity, either opens for us vistas
              into other worlds, or shuts us out altogether from anything but
              this three-dimensional world of Matter.

              Each of our seven physical senses (two of which are still unknown

              purely spiritual—corresponds with one of the seven Cosmic Planes,
              develops and uses one of the seven super-senses, and is connected
              directly, in its use on the terrestro-spiritual plane, with the
              cosmic and divine centre of force that gave it birth, and which is
              its direct creator. Each is also connected with, and under the
              direct influence of, one of the seven sacred Planets.<a href="#note_776" id="noteref_776" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">776</span></span></a>
              These belonged to the Lesser Mysteries, whose followers were
              called Mystai (the veiled), seeing that they were allowed to
              perceive things only through a mist, as it were
              <span class="tei tei-q">“with the eyes closed”</span>; while the
              Initiates or <span class="tei tei-q">“Seers”</span> of the Greater
              Mysteries were called Epoptai (those who see things unveiled). It
              was the latter only who were taught the true mysteries of the
              Zodiac and the relations and correspondences between its twelve
              signs (two secret) and the ten human orifices. The latter are now
              of course ten in the female, and only nine in the male; but this
              is merely an external difference. In the second volume of this
              work it is stated that till the end of the Third Root-Race (when
              androgynous man separated into male and female) the ten orifices
              existed in the hermaphrodite, first potentially, then
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg449"></a> functionally. The
              evolution of the human embryo shows this. For instance, the only
              opening formed at first is the buccal cavity,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“a
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">cloaca</span></span>
                communicating with the anterior extremity of the

              These become later the mouth and the posterior orifice: the Logos
              differentiating and emanating gross matter on the lower plane, in
              Occult parlance. The difficulty which some students will
              experience in reconciling the correspondences between the Zodiac
              and the orifices can be easily explained. Magic is coëval with the
              Third Root-Race, which began by creating through Kriyâshakti and
              ended by generating its species in the present way.<a href="#note_777" id="noteref_777" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">777</span></span></a>
              Woman, being left with the full or perfect cosmic number 10 (the
              divine number of Jehovah), was deemed higher and more spiritual
              than man. In Egypt, in days of old, the marriage service contained
              an article that the woman should be the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“lady of the lord,”</span> and real lord
              over him, the husband pledging himself to be
              <span class="tei tei-q">“obedient to his wife”</span> for the
              production of alchemical results such as the Elixir of Life and
              the Philosopher's Stone, for the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em>
              help of the woman was needed by the male Alchemist. But woe to the
              Alchemist who should take this in the dead-letter sense of
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em>
              union. Such sacrilege would become Black Magic and be followed by
              certain failure. The true Alchemist of old took
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aged</span></em>
              women to help him, carefully avoiding the young ones; and if any
              of them happened to be married they treated their wives for months
              both before and during their operations as sisters.

              The error of crediting the Ancients with knowing only ten of the
              zodiacal signs is explained in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>.<a href="#note_778" id="noteref_778" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a>
              The Ancients did know of twelve, but viewed these signs
              differently from ourselves. They took neither Virgo nor Scorpio
              singly into consideration, but regarded them as two in one, since
              they were made to refer directly and symbolically to the primeval
              dual man and his separation into sexes. During the reformation of
              the Zodiac, Libra was added as the twelfth sign, though it is
              simply an equilibrating sign, at the turning point—the mystery of
              separated man.

              (1) Each human being is an incarnation of his God, in other words,
              one with his
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Father in Heaven,”</span> just as Jesus,
              an Initiate, is made to say. As many men on earth, so many Gods in
              Heaven; and yet these
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg450"></a> Gods are in reality
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>, for at the end of every period of activity, they are withdrawn,
              like the rays of the setting sun, into the Parent Luminary, the
              Non-Manifested Logos, which in its turn is merged into the One
              Absolute. Shall we call these
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Fathers”</span> of ours, whether
              individually or collectively, and under any circumstances, our
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal God</span></em>? Occultism answers,
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Never</span></em>. All that an average man can know of his
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span> is what he knows of
              himself, through and within himself. The Soul of his
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Father”</span> is incarnated in
              him. This Soul is himself, if he be successful in assimilating the
              Divine Individuality while in his physical, animal shell. As to
              the Spirit thereof, as well expect to be heard by the Absolute.
              Our prayers and supplications are vain, unless to potential words
              we add potent acts, and make the Aura which surrounds each one of
              us so pure and divine that the God within us may act outwardly, or
              in other words, become as it were an extraneous Potency. Thus have
              Initiates, Saints, and very holy and pure men been enabled to help
              others as well as themselves in the hour of need, and produce what
              are foolishly called
              <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles,”</span> each by the help and
              with the aid of the God within himself, which he alone has enabled
              to act on the outward plane.

              or
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Om</span></span>, which corresponds to the upper Triangle, if pronounced by a
              very holy and pure man, will draw out, or awaken, not only the
              less exalted Potencies residing in the planetary spaces and
              elements, but even his Higher Self, or the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span> within him. Pronounced by
              an averagely good man, in the correct way, it will help to
              strengthen him morally, especially if between two
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aums</span></span>”</span>
              he meditates intently upon the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aum</span></span>
              within him, concentrating all his attention upon the ineffable
              glory. But woe to the man who pronounces it after the commission
              of some far-reaching sin: he will only thereby attract to his own
              impure photosphere invisible Presences and Forces which could not
              otherwise break through the Divine Envelope.

              is the original of Amen. Now, Amen is not a Hebrew term, but, like
              the word Halleluiah, was borrowed by the Jews and Greeks from the
              Chaldees. The latter word is often found repeated in certain
              magical inscriptions upon cups and urns among the Babylonian and
              Ninevean relics. Amen does not mean
              <span class="tei tei-q">“so be it,”</span> or
              <span class="tei tei-q">“verily,”</span> but signified in hoary
              antiquity almost the same as
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aum</span></span>. The Jewish Tanaïm (Initiates) used it for the same reason as
              the Âryan Adepts use
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aum</span></span>, and with a like success, the numerical value of

              in Hebrew <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg451"></a> letters being 91, the
              same as the full value of

              <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="he"><span style="font-style: italic">ADoNaY</span></span>, 65, or 91. Both words mean the affirmation of the being, or
              existence, of the sexless
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord”</span> within us.

              (3) Esoteric Science teaches that every sound in the visible world
              awakens its corresponding sound in the invisible realms, and
              arouses to action some force or other on the Occult side of
              Nature. Moreover, every sound corresponds to a colour and a number
              (a potency spiritual, psychic or physical) and to a sensation on
              some plane. All these find an echo in every one of the so-far
              developed elements, and even on the terrestrial plane, in the
              Lives that swarm in the terrene atmosphere, thus prompting them to
              action.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Thus a prayer, unless pronounced
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mentally</span></em>
              and addressed to one's <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span> in
              the silence and solitude of one's
              <span class="tei tei-q">“closet,”</span> must have more frequently
              disastrous than beneficial results, seeing that the masses are
              entirely ignorant of the potent effects which they thus produce.
              To produce good effects, the prayer must be uttered by
              <span class="tei tei-q">“one who knows how to make himself heard in silence,”</span>
              when it is no longer a prayer, but becomes a command. Why is Jesus
              shown to have forbidden his hearers to go to the public
              synagogues? Surely every praying man was not a hypocrite and a
              liar, nor a Pharisee who loved to be seen praying by people! He
              had a motive, we must suppose: the same motive which prompts the
              experienced Occultist to prevent his pupils from going into
              crowded places now as then, from entering churches, séance rooms,
              etc., unless they are in sympathy with the crowd.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              There is one piece of advice to be given to beginners, who cannot
              help going into crowds—one which may appear superstitious, but
              which in the absence of Occult knowledge will be found
              efficacious. As well known to good Astrologers, the days of the
              week are not in the order of those planets whose names they bear.
              The fact is that the ancient Hindus and Egyptians divided the day
              into four parts, each day being under the protection (as
              ascertained by practical magic) of a planet; and every day, as
              correctly asserted by Dion Cassius, received the name of the
              planet which ruled and protected its first portion. Let the
              student protect himself from the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Powers of the Air”</span> (Elementals)
              which throng public places, by wearing either a ring containing
              some jewel of the colour of the presiding planet, or else of the
              metal sacred to it. But the best protection is a clear conscience
              and a firm desire to benefit Humanity.

                In the accompanying diagram the days of the week do not stand in
                their usual order, though they are placed in their correct
                sequence as determined by the order of the colours in the solar
                spectrum and the corresponding colours of their ruling planets.
                The fault of the confusion in the order of the days revealed by
                this comparison lies at the door of the early Christians.
                Adopting from the Jews their lunar months, they tried to blend
                them with the solar planets, and so made a mess of it; for the
                order of the days of the week as it now stands does not follow
                the order of the planets.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Now, the Ancients arranged the planets in the following order:
                Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, counting the
                Sun as a planet for exoteric purposes. Again, the Egyptians and
                Indians, the two oldest nations, divided their day into four
                parts, each of which was under the protection and rule of a
                planet. In course of time each day came to be called by the name
                of that planet which ruled its first portion—the morning. Now,
                when they arranged their week, the Christians proceeded as
                follows: they wanted to make the day of the Sun, or Sunday, the
                seventh, so they named the days of the week by taking every
                fourth planet in turn;
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, beginning with the Moon (Monday), they counted thus: Moon,
                Mercury, Venus, Sun,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Mars</span></em>; thus Tuesday, the day whose first portion was ruled by Mars,
                became the second day of the week; and so on. It should be
                remembered also that the Moon, like the Sun, is a substitute for
                a secret planet.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The present division of the solar year was made several
                centuries later than the beginning of our era; and our week is
                not that of the Ancients and the Occultists. The septenary
                division of the four parts of the lunar phases is as old as the
                world, and originated with the people who reckoned time by the
                lunar months. The Hebrews never used it, for they counted only
                the seventh day, the Sabbath, though the second chapter of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
                seems to speak of it. Till the days of the Cæsars there is no
                trace of a week of seven days among any nation save the Hindus.
                From India it passed to the Arabs, and reached Europe with
                Christianity. The Roman week consisted of eight days, and the
                Athenian of ten.<a href="#note_780" id="noteref_780" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a>
                Thus one of the numberless contradictions
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg453"></a> and fallacies of
                Christendom is the adoption of the Indian septenary week of the
                lunar reckoning, and the preservation at the same time of the
                mythological names of the planets.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Nor do modern Astrologers give the correspondences of the days
                and planets and their colours correctly; and while Occultists
                can give good reason for every detail of their own tables of
                colours, etc., it is doubtful whether the Astrologers can do the
                same.

                To close this first Paper, let me say that the readers must in
                all necessity be separated into two broad divisions: those who
                have not quite rid themselves of the usual sceptical doubts, but
                who long to ascertain how much truth there may be in the claims
                of the Occultists; and those others who, having freed themselves
                from the trammels of Materialism and Relativity, feel that true
                and real bliss must be sought only in the knowledge and personal
                experience of that which the Hindu Philosopher calls the
                Brahmavidyâ, and the Buddhist Arhat the realization of
                Âdibuddha, the primeval Wisdom. Let the former pick out and
                study from these Papers only those explanations of the phenomena
                of life which profane Science is unable to give them. Even with
                such limitations, they will find by the end of a year or two
                that they will have learned more than all their Universities and
                Colleges can teach them. As to the sincere believers, they will
                be rewarded by seeing their faith transformed into knowledge.
                True knowledge is of Spirit and in Spirit alone, and cannot be
                acquired in any other way except through the region of the
                higher mind, the only plane from which we can penetrate the
                depths of the all-pervading Absoluteness. He who carries out
                only those laws established by human minds, who lives that life
                which is prescribed by the code of mortals and their fallible
                legislation, chooses as his guiding star a beacon which shines
                on the ocean of Mâyâ, or of temporary delusions, and lasts for
                but one incarnation. These laws are necessary for the life and
                welfare of physical man alone. He has chosen a pilot who directs
                him through the shoals of one existence, a master who parts with
                him, however, on the threshold of death. How much happier that
                man who, while strictly performing on the temporary objective
                plane the duties of daily life, carrying out each and every law
                of his country, and rendering, in short, to Cæsar what is
                Cæsar's, leads in reality a spiritual and permanent existence, a
                life with no breaks of continuity, no gaps, no interludes,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg454"></a> not even during those
                periods which are the halting-places of the long pilgrimage of
                purely spiritual life. All the phenomena of the lower human mind
                disappear like the curtain of a proscenium, allowing him to live
                in the region beyond it, the plane of the noumenal, the one
                reality. If man by suppressing, if not destroying, his
                selfishness and personality, only succeeds in knowing himself as
                he is behind the veil of physical Mâyâ, he will soon stand
                beyond all pain, all misery, and beyond all the wear and tear of
                change, which is the chief originator of pain. Such a man will
                be physically of Matter, he will move surrounded by Matter, and
                yet he will live beyond and outside it. His body will be subject
                to change, but he himself will be entirely without it, and will
                experience everlasting life even while in temporary bodies of
                short duration. All this may be achieved by the development of
                unselfish universal love of Humanity, and the suppression of
                personality, or
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">selfishness</span></em>, which is the cause of all sin, and consequently of all human
                sorrow.

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In view of the abstruse nature of the subjects dealt with, the
              present Paper will begin with an explanation of some points which
              remained obscure in the preceding one, as well as of some
              statements in which there was an appearance of contradiction.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Astrologers, of whom there are many among the Esotericists, are
              likely to be puzzled by some statements distinctly contradicting
              their teachings; whilst those who know nothing of the subject may
              perhaps find themselves opposed at the outset by those who have
              studied the exoteric systems of the Kabalah and Astrology. For let
              it be distinctly known, nothing of that which is printed
              broadcast, and available to every student in public libraries or
              museums, is really Esoteric, but is either mixed with deliberate
              <span class="tei tei-q">“blinds,”</span> or cannot be understood
              and studied with profit without a complete glossary of Occult
              terms.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The following teachings and explanations, therefore, may be useful
              to the student in assisting him to formulate the teaching given in
              the preceding Paper.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In Diagram I. it will be observed that the 3, 7, and 10 centres
              are respectively as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The 3 pertain to the spiritual world of the Absolute, and
              therefore to the three higher principles in Man.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) The 7 belong to the spiritual, psychic, and physical worlds and
              to the body of man. Physics, metaphysics and hyper-physics are the
              triad that symbolizes man on this plane.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) The 10, or the sum total of these, is the Universe as a whole,
              in all its aspects, and also its Microcosm—Man, with his ten
              orifices.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Laying aside, for the moment, the Higher Decad (Kosmos) and the
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg456"></a> Lower Decad (Man), the
              first three numbers of the separate sevens have a direct reference
              to the Spirit, Soul and Auric Envelope of the human being, as well
              as to the higher supersensual world. The lower four, or the four
              aspects, belong to Man also, as well as to the Universal Kosmos,
              the whole being synthesized by the Absolute.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              If these three discrete or distributive degrees of Being be
              conceived, according to the Symbology of all the Eastern
              Religions, as contained in one Ovum, or
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Egg</span></span>, the name of that
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Egg</span></span>

              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All-Being</span></span>
              on the manifested plane. This Universe has, in truth, neither
              centre nor periphery; but in the individual and finite mind of man
              it has such a definition, the natural consequence of the
              limitations of human thought.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In Diagram II., as already stated therein, no notice need be taken
              of the numbers used in the left-hand column, as these refer only
              to the Hierarchies of the Colours and Sounds on the metaphysical
              plane, and are not the characteristic numbers of the human
              principles or of the planets. The human principles elude
              enumeration, because each man differs from every other, just as no
              two blades of grass on the whole earth are absolutely alike.
              Numbering is here a question of spiritual progress and the natural
              predominance of one principle over another. With one man it may be
              Buddhi that stands as number one; with another, if he be a bestial
              sensualist, the Lower Manas. With one the physical body, or
              perhaps Prâna, the life principle, will be on the first and
              highest plane, as would be the case in an extremely healthy man,
              full of vitality; with another it may come as the sixth or even
              seventh downward. Again, the colours and metals corresponding to
              the planets and human principles, as will be observed, are not
              those known exoterically to modern Astrologers and Western
              Occultists.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Let us see whence the modern Astrologer got his notions about the
              correspondence of planets, metals and colours. And here we are
              reminded of the modern Orientalist, who, judging by appearances
              credits the ancient Akkadians (and also the Chaldæans, Hindus and
              Egyptians) with the crude notion that the Universe, and in like
              manner the earth, was like an inverted, bell-shaped bowl! This he
              demonstrates by pointing to the symbolical representations of some
              Akkadian inscriptions and to the Assyrian carvings. It is,
              however, no place here to explain how mistaken is the
              Assyriologist, for all such representations are simply symbolical
              of the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Khargakkurra</span></span>, the World-Mountain, or Meru, and relate only to the North Pole,

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              This is the arrangement now adopted by Christian Astrologers, with
              the exception of the order of the days of the week, of which, by
              associating the solar planetary names with the lunar weeks, they
              have made a sore mess, as has been already shown in Paper I. This
              is the Ptolemaic geocentric system, which represents the Universe
              as in the following diagram, showing our Earth in the centre of
              the Universe, and the Sun a Planet, the fourth in number.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              And if the Christian chronology and order of the days of the week
              are being daily denounced as being based on an entirely wrong
              astronomical foundation, it is high time to begin a reform also in
              Astrology built on such lines, and coming to us entirely from the
              Chaldæan and Assyrian exoteric mob.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              But the correspondences given in these Papers are purely Esoteric.
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg458"></a> For this reason it
              follows that when the Planets of the Solar System are named or
              symbolized (as in Diagram II.) it must not be supposed that the
              planetary bodies themselves are referred to, except as types on a
              purely physical plane of the septenary nature of the psychic and
              spiritual worlds. A material planet can correspond only to a
              material something. Thus when Mercury is said to correspond to the
              right eye, it does not mean that the objective planet has any
              influence on the right optic organ, but that both stand rather as
              corresponding mystically through Buddhi. Man derives his Spiritual
              Soul (Buddhi) from the essence of the Mânasa Putra, the Sons of
              Wisdom, who are the Divine Beings (or Angels) ruling and presiding
              over the planet Mercury.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In the same way Venus, Manas and the left eye are set down as
              correspondences. Exoterically, there is, in reality, no such
              association of physical eyes and physical planets; but
              Esoterically there is; for the right eye is the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye of Wisdom,”</span>
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, it corresponds magnetically with that Occult centre in the
              brain which we call the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Third Eye”</span>;<a href="#note_782" id="noteref_782" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a>
              while the left corresponds with the intellectual brain, or those
              cells which are the organ on the physical plane of the thinking
              faculty. The kabalistic triangle of Kether, Chokmah and Binah
              shows this. Chokmah and Binah, or Wisdom and Intelligence, the
              Father and Mother, or, again, the Father and Son, are on the same
              plane and reäct mutually on one another.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              When the individual consciousness is turned inward, a conjunction
              of Manas and Buddhi takes place. In the spiritually regenerated
              man this conjunction is permanent, the Higher Manas clinging to
              Buddhi beyond the threshold of Devachan, and the Soul, or rather
              the Spirit, which should not be confounded with Âtmâ, the
              Super-Spirit, is then said to have the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Single Eye.”</span> Esoterically, in
              other words, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Third Eye”</span> is
              active. Now Mercury is called Hermes, and Venus, Aphrodite, and
              thus their conjunction in man on the psycho-physical plane gives
              him the name of the Hermaphrodite, or Androgyne. The absolutely
              Spiritual Man is, however, entirely disconnected from sex. The
              Spiritual Man corresponds directly with the higher
              <span class="tei tei-q">“coloured circles,”</span> the Divine
              Prism which emanates from the One Infinite White Circle; while
              physical man emanates from the Sephiroth, which are the Voices or
              Sounds of Eastern Philosophy. And these
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Voices”</span>
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg 459]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg459"></a> are lower than the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Colours,”</span> for they are the seven
              lower Sephiroth, or the objective Sounds, seen, not heard, as the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
              shows,<a href="#note_783" id="noteref_783" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a>
              and even the Old Testament also. For, when properly translated,
              verse 18 of chapter xx.
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodus</span></span>
              would read:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“And the people saw the Voices”</span> (or
              Sounds, not the <span class="tei tei-q">“thunderings”</span> as
              now translated); and these Voices, or Sounds, are the Sephiroth.<a href="#note_784" id="noteref_784" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              In the same way the right and left nostrils, into which is
              breathed the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath of Lives”</span><a href="#note_785" id="noteref_785" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a>
              are here said to correspond with Sun and Moon, as Brahmâ-Prajâpati
              and Vâch, or Osiris and Isis, are the parents of the natural life.
              This Quaternary,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: the two eyes and two nostrils, Mercury and Venus, Sun and Moon,
              constitutes the Kabalistic Guardian-Angels of the Four Corners of
              the Earth. It is the same in the Eastern Esoteric Philosophy,
              which, however, adds that the Sun is not a planet, but the central
              star of our system, and the Moon a dead planet, from which all the
              principles are gone, both being substitutes, the one for an
              invisible inter-Mercurial planet, and the other for a planet which
              seems to have now altogether disappeared from view. These are the
              Four Mahârâjahs,<a href="#note_786" id="noteref_786" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a>
              the <span class="tei tei-q">“Four Holy Ones”</span> connected with
              Karma and Humanity, Kosmos and Man, in all their aspects. They
              are: the Sun, or its substitute Michael; Moon, or substitute
              Gabriel; Mercury, Raphael; and Venus, Uriel. It need hardly be
              said here again that the planetary bodies themselves, being only
              physical symbols, are not often referred to in the Esoteric
              System, but, as a rule, their cosmic, psychic, physical and
              spiritual forces are symbolized under these names. In short, it is
              the seven physical planets which are the lower Sephiroth of the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, and our triple physical Sun whose reflection only we see, which
              is symbolized, or rather personified, by the Upper Triad, or
              Sephirothal Crown.<a href="#note_787" id="noteref_787" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Then, again, it will be well to point out that the numbers
              attached to the psychic principles in Diagram I. appear the
              reverse of those in exoteric writings. This is because numbers in
              this connection are purely arbitrary, changing with every school.
              Some schools count
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg460"></a> three, some four, some
              six, and others seven, as do all the Buddhist Esotericists. As
              said before,<a href="#note_788" id="noteref_788" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a>
              the Esoteric School has been divided into two departments since
              the fourteenth century, one for the inner Lanoos, or higher
              Chelâs, the other for the outer circle, or lay Chelâs. Mr. Sinnett
              was distinctly told in the letters he received from one of the
              Gurus that he could not be taught the real Esoteric Doctrine given
              out only to the pledged disciples of the Inner Circle. The numbers
              and principles do not go in regular sequence, like the skins of an
              onion, but the student must work out for himself the number
              appropriate to each of his principles, when the time comes for him
              to enter upon practical study. The above will suggest to the
              student the necessity of knowing the principles by their names and
              their appropriate faculties apart from any system of enumeration,
              or by association with their corresponding centres of actions,
              colours, sounds, etc., until these become inseparable.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The old and familiar mode of reckoning the principles, given in
              the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theosophist</span></span>
              and
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>, leads to another apparently perplexing contradiction, though it
              is really none at all. The principles numbered 3 and 2,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>: Linga Sharîra and Prâna, or Jîva, stand in the reverse order to
              that given in Diagram I. A moment's consideration will suffice to
              explain the apparent discrepancy between the exoteric enumeration,
              and the Esoteric order given in Diagram I. For in Diagram I. the
              Linga Sharîra is defined as the vehicle of Prâna, or Jîva, the
              life principle, and as such must of necessity be inferior to
              Prâna, not superior as the exoteric enumeration would suggest. The
              principles do not stand one above the other, and thus cannot be
              taken in numerical sequence; their order depends upon the
              superiority and predominance of one or another principle, and
              therefore differs in every man.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The Linga Sharîra is the double, or protoplasmic antetype of the
              body, which is its image. It is in this sense that it is called in
              Diagram II. the parent of the physical body,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the mother by conception of Prâna, the father. This idea is
              conveyed in the Egyptian mythology by the birth of Horus, the
              child of Osiris and Isis, although, like all sacred Mythoi, this
              has both a threefold spiritual, and a sevenfold psycho-physical
              application. To close the subject, Prâna, the life principle, can,
              in sober truth, have no number, as it pervades
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg461"></a> every other principle,
              or the human total. Each number of the seven would thus be
              naturally applicable to Prâna-Jîva exoterically as it is to the
              Auric Body Esoterically. As Pythagoras showed, Kosmos was produced
              not
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>
              or
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>
              number, but geometrically,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, following the proportions of numbers.

              Thus it will be seen that the influence of the solar system in the
              exoteric kabalistic Astrology is by this method distributed over
              the entire human body, the primary metals, and the gradations of
              colour from black to white; but that Esotericism recognizes
              neither black nor white as colours, because it holds religiously
              to the seven solar or natural colours of the prism. Black and
              white are artificial tints. They belong to the Earth, and are only
              perceived by virtue of the special construction of our physical
              organs. White is the absence of all colours, and therefore no
              colour; black is simply the absence of light, and therefore the
              negative aspect of white. The seven prismatic colours are direct
              emanations from the Seven Hierarchies of Being, each of which has
              a direct bearing upon and relation to one of the human principles,
              since each of these Hierarchies is, in fact, the creator and
              source of the corresponding human principle. Each prismatic colour
              is called in Occultism the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Father of the Sound”</span> which
              corresponds to it; Sound being the Word, or the Logos, of its
              Father-Thought. This is the reason why sensitives connect every
              colour with a definite sound, a fact well recognized in Modern
              Science (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, Francis Galton's
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Human Faculty</span></span>). But black and white are
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg463"></a> entirely negative
              colours, and have no representatives in the world of subjective
              being.

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Kabalistic Astrology says that the dominion of the planetary
              bodies in the human brain also is defined thus: there are seven
              primary groups of faculties, six of which function through the
              cerebrum, and the seventh through the cerebellum. This is
              perfectly correct Esoterically. But when it is further said that:
              Saturn governs the devotional faculties; Mercury, the
              intellectual; Jupiter, the sympathetic; the Sun, the governing
              faculties; Mars, the selfish; Venus, the tenacious; and the Moon,
              the instincts;—we say that the explanation is incomplete and even
              misleading. For, in the first place, the physical planets can rule
              only the physical body and the purely physical functions. All the
              mental, emotional, psychic and spiritual faculties, are influenced
              by the Occult properties of the scale of causes which emanate from
              the Hierarchies of the Spiritual Rulers of the planets, and not by
              the planets themselves. This scale, as given in Diagram II., leads
              the student to perceive in the following order: (1) colour; (2)
              sound; (3) the sound materializes into the spirit of the metals,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the metallic Elementals; (4) these materialize again into the
              physical metals; (5) then the harmonial and vibratory radiant
              essence passes into the plants, giving them colour and smell, both
              of which <span class="tei tei-q">“properties”</span> depend upon
              the rate of vibration of this energy per unit of time; (6) from
              plants it passes into the animals; (7) and finally culminates in
              the <span class="tei tei-q">“principles”</span> of man.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Thus we see the Divine Essence of our Progenitors in Heaven
              circling through seven stages; Spirit becoming Matter, and Matter
              returning to Spirit. As there is sound in Nature which is
              inaudible, so there is colour which is invisible, but which can be
              heard. The creative force, at work in its incessant task of
              transformation, produces colour, sound and numbers, in the shape
              of rates of vibration which compound and dissociate the atoms and
              molecules. Though invisible and inaudible to us in detail, yet the
              synthesis of the whole becomes audible to us on the material
              plane. It is that which the Chinese call the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Tone,”</span> or
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Kung</span></span>. It is, even by scientific confession, the actual tonic of
              Nature, held by musicians to be the middle Fa on the keyboard of a
              piano. We hear it distinctly in the voice of Nature, in the
              roaring of the ocean, in the sound of the foliage of a great
              forest, in the distant roar of a great city, in the wind, the
              tempest and the storm; in short, in everything in Nature which has
              a voice or produces sound. To the
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg464"></a> hearing of all who
              hearken, it culminates in a single definite tone, of an
              unappreciable pitch, which, as said, is the F, or Fa, of the
              diatonic scale. From these particulars, that wherein lies the
              difference between the exoteric and the Esoteric nomenclature and
              symbolism will be evident to the student of Occultism. In short,
              kabalistic Astrology, as practised in Europe, is the semi-esoteric
              Secret Science, adapted for the outer and not for the inner
              circle. It is, furthermore, often left incomplete and not
              infrequently distorted to conceal the real truth. While it
              symbolizes and adapts its correspondences on the mere appearances
              of things, Esoteric Philosophy, which concerns itself
              pre-eminently with the essence of things, accepts only such
              symbols as cover the whole ground,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, such symbols as yield a spiritual as well as a psychic and
              physical meaning. Yet even Western Astrology has done excellent
              work, for it has helped to carry the knowledge of the existence of
              a Secret Wisdom throughout the dangers of the Mediæval Ages and
              their dark bigotry up to the present day, when all danger has
              disappeared.

              The order of the planets in exoteric practice is that defined by
              their geocentric radii, or the distance of their several orbits
              from the Earth as a centre,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury and Moon. In the

              supreme power in the physical, manifested universe, or Brahmâ,
              Vishnu and Shiva; while in the last four we recognize the symbols
              of the terrestrial quaternary ruling over all natural and physical
              revolutions of the seasons, quarters of the day, points of the
              compass, and elements. Thus:

                Spirit. Thus, before proceeding to exemplify and explain these
                relations, it may perhaps be useful to give the student a
                correct idea of the full meaning of this most misunderstood word
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Magic.”</span> Many are those willing
                and eager to study Occultism, but very few have even an
                approximate idea of the Science itself. Now, very few of our
                American and European students can derive benefit from Sanskrit
                works or even their translations, as these translations are, for
                the most part, merely blinds to the uninitiated. I therefore
                propose to offer to their attention demonstrations of the
                aforesaid drawn from Neo-Platonic works. These are accessible in
                translation; and in order to throw light on that which has
                hitherto been full of darkness, it will suffice to point to a
                certain key in them. Thus the Gnosis, both pre-Christian and
                post-Christian, will serve our purpose admirably.

                There are millions of Christians who know the name of Simon
                Magus, and the little that is told about him in the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span>; but very few who have even heard of the many motley,
                fantastic and contradictory details which tradition records
                about his life. The story of his claims and his death is to be
                found only in the prejudiced, half-fantastic records about him
                in the works of the Church Fathers, such as Irenæus, Epiphanius
                and St. Justin, and especially in the anonymous
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophumena</span></span>. Yet he is a historical character, and the appellation of
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Magus”</span> was given to him and was
                accepted by all his contemporaries, including the heads of the
                Christian Church, as a qualification indicating the miraculous
                powers he possessed, and irrespective of whether he was regarded
                as a white (divine) or a black (infernal) Magician. In this
                respect, opinion has always been made subservient to the Gentile
                or Christian proclivities of his chronicler.

                It is in his system and in that of Menander, his pupil and
                successor, that we find what the term
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Magic”</span> meant for Initiates in
                those days.

                Simon, as all the other Gnostics, taught that our world was
                created by the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower</span></em>
                angels, whom he called Æons. He mentions only three
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page466">[pg 466]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg466"></a> degrees of such,
                because it was and is useless, as we have before explained, to
                teach anything about the four higher ones, and he therefore
                begins at the plane of globes A and G. His system is as near to
                Occult Truth as any, so that we may examine it, as well as his
                own and Menander's claims about
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Magic,”</span> to find out what they
                meant by the term. Now, for Simon, the summit of all manifested
                creation was Fire. It was, with him as with us, the Universal
                Principle, the Infinite Potency, born from the concealed
                Potentiality. This Fire was the primeval cause of the manifested
                world of being, and was dual, having a manifested and a
                concealed, or secret, side.

                he writes, which amounts to saying that the visible is ever
                present in the invisible, and the invisible in the visible. This
                was but a new form of stating Plato's idea of the Intelligible
                (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Noêton</span></span>) and the Sensible (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Aisthêton</span></span>), and Aristotle's teaching on the Potency (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Dunamis</span></span>) and the Act (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Energeia</span></span>). For Simon, all that can be thought of, all that can be acted
                upon, was perfect intelligence. Fire contained
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>. And thus all the parts of that Fire, being endowed with
                intelligence and reason, were susceptible of development by
                extension and emanation. This is our teaching of the Manifested
                Logos, and these parts in their primordial emanation are our
                Dhyân Chohans, the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Flame and Fire,”</span> or
                higher Æons. This <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire”</span> is the
                symbol of the active and living side of Divine Nature. Behind it
                lay
                <span class="tei tei-q">“infinite Potentiality in Potentiality,”</span>
                which Simon named
                <span class="tei tei-q">“that which has stood, stands and will stand,”</span>
                or permanent stability and personified immutability.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                From the Potency of Thought, Divine Ideation thus passed to
                Action. Hence the series of primordial emanations through
                Thought begetting the Act, the objective side of Fire being the
                Mother, the sacred side of it being the Father. Simon called
                these emanations Syzygies (a united pair, or couple), for they
                emanated two-by-two, one as an active, and the other as a
                passive Æon. Three couples thus emanated (or six in all, the
                Fire being the seventh), to which Simon gave the following
                names:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind and Thought; Voice and Name; Reason and

                the first in each pair being male, the last female. From these
                primordial six emanated the six Æons of the Middle World. Let us

                is the direct result of that power, an effect which depends on
                our own action. That power, then, is inherent in man, as it is

                the seventh, the Parent Potency, passed into Act, and emanated,
                in their turn, six secondary Æons, which were each synthesized

                Simon's Third World with its third series of six Æons and the
                seventh, the Parent, is emanated in the same way. It is this
                same note which runs through every Gnostic system—gradual
                development downward into Matter by similitude; and it is a law
                which is to be traced down to primordial Occultism, or Magic.
                With the Gnostics, as with us, this seventh Potency,
                synthesizing all, is the Spirit brooding over the dark waters of
                undifferentiated Space, Nârâyana, or Vishnu, in India; the Holy
                Ghost in Christianity. But while in the latter the conception is
                conditioned and dwarfed by limitations necessitating
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg469"></a> faith and grace,
                Eastern Philosophy shows it pervading every atom, conscious or
                unconscious. Irenæus supplements the information on the further
                development of these six Æons. We learn from him that Thought,
                having separated itself from its Parent, and knowing through its
                identity of Essence with the latter what it had to know,
                proceeded on the second or intermediate plane, or rather World
                (each of such Worlds consisting of two planes, the superior and
                inferior, male and female, the latter assuming finally both
                Potencies and becoming androgyne), to create inferior
                Hierarchies, Angels and Powers, Dominions and Hosts, of every
                description, which in their turn created, or rather emanated out
                of their own Essence, our world with its men and beings, over
                which they watch.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                It thus follows that every rational being—called Man on Earth—is
                of the same essence and possesses potentially all the attributes
                of the higher Æons, the primordial Seven. It is for him to

                    infinite Potency, if it makes itself like unto this image.
                    For three, he says, are they that stand, and without these
                    three Æons of stability, there is no adornment of the

                    on the water, and being moulded according to the similitude
                    is a perfect and celestial (Æon), in no manner of thinking
                    inferior to the ingenerable Potency. Thus they say:</span>

                  <span style="font-size: 90%">This, he says, is the one Potency, divided into above and
                    below, generating itself, nourishing itself, seeking itself,
                    finding itself; its own mother, father, brother, spouse,

                The above is given for the elucidation of that which is to
                follow. The disciples of Simon Magus were numerous, and were
                instructed by him in Magic. They made use of so-called
                <span class="tei tei-q">“exorcisms”</span> (as in the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament</span></span>), incantations, philtres; believed in dreams and visions, and
                produced them at will; and finally forced the lower orders of
                spirits to obey them. Simon Magus was called
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the Great Power of God,”</span>
                literally
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the Potency of the Deity which is called Great.”</span>
                That which was then termed Magic we now call Theosophia, or
                Divine Wisdom, Power and Knowledge.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                His direct disciple, Menander, was also a great Magician. Says
                Irenæus, among other writers:

                Thus both master and pupil are shown as having attained the
                highest powers in the art of enchantments, powers which can be
                obtained only through
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the help of the Devil,”</span> as
                Christians claim; and yet their
                <span class="tei tei-q">“works”</span> were identical with those
                spoken of in the

                and are, therefore, believed in and accepted as coming from and
                through God. But the question is, have these so-called
                <span class="tei tei-q">“miracles”</span> of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ”</span> and the Apostles ever
                been explained any more than the magical achievements of
                so-called Sorcerers and Magicians? I say, never. We Occultists
                do not believe in supernatural phenomena, and the Masters laugh
                at the word <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle.”</span> Let us
                see, then, what is really the sense of the word Magic.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The source and basis of it lie in Spirit and Thought, whether on
                the purely divine or the terrestrial plane. Those who know the
                history of Simon have the two versions before them, that of
                White and of Black Magic, at their option, in the much talked of
                union of Simon with Helena, whom he called his Epinoia
                (Thought). Those who, like the Christians, had to discredit a
                dangerous rival, talk of Helena as being a beautiful and actual
                woman, whom Simon had met in a house of ill-fame at Tyre, and
                who was, according to those who wrote his life, the
                reincarnation of Helen of Troy. How, then, was she
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Thought”</span>? The lower
                angels, Simon is made to say in
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophumena</span></span>, or the third Æons, being so material, had more badness in
                them than all the others. Poor man, created or emanated from
                them, had the vice of his origin. What was it? Only this: when
                the third Æons possessed themselves, in their turn, of the
                Divine Thought through
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg472"></a> the transmission into
                them of Fire, instead of making of man a complete being,
                according to the universal plan, they at first detained from him
                that Divine Spark (Thought, on Earth Manas); and that was the
                cause and origin of senseless man's committing the original sin
                as the angels had committed it æons before by refusing to
                create.<a href="#note_809" id="noteref_809" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a>
                Finally, after detaining Epinoia prisoner amongst them and
                having subjected the Divine Thought to every kind of insult and
                desecration, they ended by shutting it into the already defiled
                body of man. After this, as interpreted by the enemies of Simon,
                she passed from one female body into another through ages and
                races, until Simon found and recognized her in the form of
                Helena, the <span class="tei tei-q">“prostitute,”</span> the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“lost sheep”</span> of the parable.
                Simon is made to represent himself as the Saviour descended on
                Earth to rescue this <span class="tei tei-q">“lamb”</span> and
                those men in whom Epinoia is still under the dominion of the
                lower angels. The greatest magical feats are thus attributed to
                Simon through his sexual union with Helena, hence Black Magic.
                Indeed, the chief rites of this kind of Magic are based on such
                disgusting literal interpretation of noble myths, one of the
                noblest of which was thus invented by Simon as a symbolical mark
                of his own teaching. Those who understood it correctly knew what
                was meant by <span class="tei tei-q">“Helena.”</span> It was the
                marriage of Nous (Âtmâ-Buddhi) with Manas, the union through
                which Will and Thought become one and are endowed with divine
                powers. For Âtman in man, being of an unalloyed essence, the
                primordial Divine Fire (or the eternal and universal
                <span class="tei tei-q">“that which has stood, stands and will stand”</span>), is of all the planes; and Buddhi is its vehicle or Thought,
                generated by and generating the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Father”</span> in her turn, and also
                Will. She is
                <span class="tei tei-q">“that which has stood, stands and will stand,”</span>
                thus becoming, in conjunction with Manas, male-female, in this
                sphere only. Hence, when Simon spoke of himself as the Father
                and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and of Helena as his Epinoia,
                Divine Thought, he meant the marriage of his Buddhi with Manas.
                Helena was the Shakti of the inner man, the female potency.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Now, what says Menander? The lower angels, he taught, were the
                emanations of Ennoia (Designing Thought). It was Ennoia who
                taught the Science of Magic and imparted it to him, together
                with the art of conquering the creative angels of the lower
                world. The latter stand for the passions of our lower nature.
                His pupils, after receiving
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg473"></a> baptism from him
                (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, after Initiation), were said to
                <span class="tei tei-q">“resurrect from the dead”</span> and,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“growing no older,”</span> became
                <span class="tei tei-q">“immortal.”</span><a href="#note_810" id="noteref_810" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a>
                This <span class="tei tei-q">“resurrection”</span> promised by
                Menander meant, of course, simply the passage from the darkness
                of ignorance into the light of truth, the awakening of man's
                immortal Spirit to inner and eternal life. This is the Science
                of the Râja Yogîs—Magic.

                Every person who has read Neo-Platonic Philosophy knows how its
                chief Adepts, such as Plotinus, and especially Porphyry, fought
                against phenomenal Theurgy. But, beyond all of them, Jamblichus,

                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Mysteriis</span></span>, lifts high the veil from the real term Theurgy, and shows us

                Jamblichus execrates physical phenomena, produced, as he says,
                by the bad demons who deceive men (the spooks of the séance
                room), as vehemently as he exalts Divine Theurgy. But to
                exercise the latter, he teaches, the Theurgist must imperatively
                be
                <span class="tei tei-q">“a man of high morality and a chaste Soul.”</span>
                The other kind of Magic is used only by impure, selfish men, and
                has nothing of the Divine in it. No real Vates would ever
                consent to find in its communications anything coming from our
                higher Gods. Thus one (Theurgy) is the knowledge of our Father
                (the Higher Self); the other, subjection to our lower nature.
                One requires holiness of the Soul, a holiness which rejects and
                excludes everything corporeal; the other, the desecration of it
                (the Soul). One is the union with the Gods (with one's God), the
                source of all Good; the other intercourse with demons
                (Elementals), which, unless we subject them, will subject us,
                and lead us step by step to moral ruin (mediumship). In short:

                    nature begets itself through itself, moves through its own

                Now, Jamblichus shows us how this union of our Higher Soul with
                the Universal Soul, with the Gods, is to be effected. He speaks
                of Manteia, which is Samâdhi, the highest trance.<a href="#note_813" id="noteref_813" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a>
                He speaks also of dream which is divine vision, when man
                re-becomes again a God. By Theurgy, or Râja Yoga, a man arrives
                at: (1) Prophetic Discernment through our God (the respective
                Higher Ego of each of us) revealing to us the truths of the
                plane on which we happen to be acting; (2) Ecstacy and
                Illumination; (3) Action in Spirit (in Astral Body or through
                Will); (4) and Domination over the minor, senseless demons
                (Elementals) by the very nature of our purified Egos. But this
                demands the complete purification of the latter. And this is
                called by him Magic, through initiation into Theurgy.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                But Theurgy has to be preceded by a training of our senses and
                the knowledge of the human Self in relation to the Divine
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Self</span></span>. So long as man has not thoroughly mastered this preliminary
                study, it is idle to anthropomorphize the formless. By
                <span class="tei tei-q">“formless”</span> I mean the higher and
                the lower Gods, the supermundane as well as mundane Spirits, or

                Sounds. For none but a high Adept can perceive a
                <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> in its true transcendental
                form, which to the untrained intellect, to the Chelâ, will be
                visible only by its Aura. The visions of full figures casually
                perceived by sensitives and mediums belong to one or another of

                <span class="tei tei-q">“principles”</span>—which are but the
                various aspects of the triune (spiritual and physical) man—and
                our Paradigm, the direct roots of these in the Universe.
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg475"></a> In view of this, we
                must resume our teaching about the Hierarchies directly
                connected and for ever linked with man.

                Enough has been said to show that while for the Orientalists and
                profane masses the sentence,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Om Mani Padme Hum</span></span>,”</span>
                means simply
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh the Jewel in the Lotus,”</span>
                Esoterically it signifies
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh my God within me.”</span> Yes; there
                is a God in each human being, for man was, and will re-become,
                God. The sentence points to the indissoluble union between Man
                and the Universe. For the Lotus is the universal symbol of
                Kosmos as the absolute totality, and the Jewel is Spiritual Man,
                or God.

                In the preceding Paper, the correspondences between Colours,
                Sounds, and <span class="tei tei-q">“Principles”</span> were
                given; and those who have read our second volume will remember
                that these seven principles are derived from the seven great
                Hierarchies of Angels, or Dhyân Chohans, which are, in their
                turn, associated with Colours and Sounds, and form collectively
                the Manifested Logos.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                In the eternal music of the spheres we find the perfect scale
                corresponding to the colours, and in the number, determined by
                the vibrations of colour and sound, which
                <span class="tei tei-q">“underlies every form and guides every sound,”</span>
                we find the summing-up of the Manifested Universe.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                We may illustrate these correspondences by showing the relation
                of colour and sound to the geometrical figures which<a href="#note_814" id="noteref_814" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a>

                But the student will certainly be liable to confusion if, in
                studying the Diagrams, he does not remember two things: (1)
                That, our plane being a plane of reflection, and therefore
                illusionary,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the various notations are reversed and must be counted from
                    below upwards</span></em>. The musical scale begins from below upwards, commencing with
                the deep Do and ending with the far more acute Si. (2) That Kâma
                Rûpa (corresponding to Do in the musical scale), containing as
                it does all potentialities of Matter, is necessarily the
                starting-point on our plane. Further, it commences the notation
                on every plane, as corresponding to the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“matter”</span> of that plane. Again,
                the student must also remember that these notes have to be
                arranged in a circle, thus showing how Fa is the middle note of
                Nature. In short, musical notes, or Sounds, Colours
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg 476]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg476"></a> and Numbers proceed
                from one to seven, and not from seven to one as erroneously
                shown in the spectrum of the prismatic colours, in which Red is
                counted first: a fact which necessitated my putting the
                principles and the days of the week at random in Diagram II. The
                musical scale and colours, according to the number of
                vibrations, proceed from the world of gross Matter to that of
                Spirit thus:

                In Kosmos, the gradations and correlations of Colours and
                Sounds, and therefore of Numbers are infinite. This is suspected
                even in Physics, for it is ascertained that there exist slower
                vibrations than those of the Red, the slowest perceptible to us,
                and far more rapid vibrations than those of the Violet, the most
                rapid that our senses can perceive. But on Earth, in our
                physical world, the range of perceptible vibrations is limited.
                Our physical senses cannot take cognizance of vibrations above
                and below the septenary and limited gradations of the prismatic
                colours, for such vibrations are incapable of causing in us the

                unless we learn to paralyze our Quaternary and discern both the
                superior and inferior vibrations with our spiritual senses
                seated in the upper Triangle.

                Now, on this plane of illusion, there are three fundamental
                colours, as demonstrated by Physical Science, Red, Blue and
                Yellow (or rather Orange-Yellow). Expressed in terms of the
                human principles they are: (1) Kâma Rûpa, the seat of the animal
                sensations, welded to, and serving as a vehicle for the Animal
                Soul or Lower Manas (Red and Green, as said, being
                interchangeable); (2) Auric Envelope, or the essence of man; and
                (3) Prâna, or Life Principle. But if from the realm of illusion,
                or the living man as he is on our Earth, subject to his sensuous
                perceptions only, we pass to that of semi-illusion, and observe
                the natural colours themselves, or those of the principles, that
                is, if we try to find out which are those that in the perfect
                man absorb all others, we shall find that the colours correspond

                a Yogî in the trance state and a mesmerized subject, side by

                for practical Occult powers or only for the purely psychic and
                spiritual gifts of clairvoyance and metaphysical knowledge, to

                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg 481]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg481"></a> correspondences
                between the human, or nature principles, and those of Kosmos. It
                is ignorance which leads materialistic Science to deny the inner
                man and his Divine powers; knowledge and personal experience
                that allow the Occultist to affirm that such powers are as
                natural to man as swimming to fishes. It is like a Laplander, in
                all sincerity, denying the possibility of the catgut, strung
                loosely on the sounding-board of a violin producing
                comprehensive sounds or melody. Our principles are the
                Seven-Stringed Lyre of Apollo, truly. In this our age, when
                oblivion has shrouded ancient knowledge, men's faculties are no
                better than the loose strings of the violin to the Laplander.
                But the Occultist who knows how to tighten them and tune his
                violin in harmony with the vibrations of colour and sound, will
                extract divine harmony from them. The combination of these
                powers and the attuning of the Microcosm and the Macrocosm will
                give the geometrical equivalent of the invocation

                Further, each of the Primordial Seven, the first Seven Rays
                forming the Manifested Logos, is again sevenfold. Thus, as the
                seven colours of the solar spectrum correspond to the seven
                Rays, or Hierarchies, so each of these latter has again its
                seven divisions corresponding to the same series of colours. But
                in this case one colour,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, that which characterizes the particular Hierarchy as a whole,
                is predominant and more intense than the others.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                These Hierarchies can only be symbolized as concentric circles
                of prismatic colours; each Hierarchy being represented by a
                series of seven concentric circles, each circle representing one
                of the prismatic colours in their natural order. But in each of
                these <span class="tei tei-q">“wheels”</span> one circle will be
                brighter and more vivid in colour than the rest, and the wheel
                will have a surrounding Aura (a fringe, as the physicists call
                it) of that colour. This colour will be the characteristic
                colour of that Hierarchy as a whole. Each of these Hierarchies
                furnishes the essence (the Soul) and is the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Builder”</span> of one of the seven
                kingdoms of Nature which are the three elemental kingdoms, the

                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page482">[pg 482]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg482"></a> animal, and the

                Moreover, each Hierarchy furnishes the Aura of one of the seven
                principles in man with its specific colour. Further, as each of
                these Hierarchies is the Ruler of one of the Sacred Planets, it
                will easily be understood how Astrology came into existence, and
                that real Astrology has a strictly scientific basis.

                The symbol adopted in the Eastern School to represent the Seven
                Hierarchies of creative Powers is a wheel of seven concentric
                circles, each circle being coloured with one of the seven
                colours; call them Angels, if you will, or Planetary Spirits,
                or, again, the Seven Rulers of the Seven Sacred Planets of our

                Thus the Linga Sharîra is derived from the Violet sub-ray of the
                Violet Hierarchy; the Higher Manas is similarly derived from the
                Indigo sub-ray of the Indigo Hierarchy, and so on. Every man
                being born under a certain planet, there will always be a
                predominance of that planet's colour in him, because that
                <span class="tei tei-q">“principle”</span> wall rule in him
                which has its origin in the Hierarchy in question. There will
                also be a certain amount of the colour derived from the other
                planets present in his Aura, but that of the ruling planet will
                be strongest. Now a person in whom, say, the Mercury principle
                is predominant, will, by acting upon the Mercury principle in
                another person born under a different planet, be able to get him
                entirely under his control. For the stronger Mercury principle
                in him will overpower the weaker Mercurial element in the other.
                But he will have little power over persons born under the same
                planet as himself. This is the key to the Occult Sciences of
                Magnetism and Hypnotism.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The student will understand that the Orders and Hierarchies are
                here named after their corresponding colours, so as to avoid
                using numerals, which would be confusing in connection with the
                human principles, as the latter have no proper numbers of their
                own. The real Occult names of these Hierarchies cannot now be
                given.

                The student must, however remember that the colours which we see
                with our physical eyes are not the true colours of Occult
                Nature, but are merely the effects produced on the mechanism of
                our physical organs by certain rates of vibration. For instance,
                Clerk Maxwell has demonstrated that the retinal effects of any
                colour may be imitated by properly combining three other
                colours. It follows, therefore, that our retina has only three
                distinct colour sensations, and we therefore do not perceive the
                seven colours which really exist, but only their
                <span class="tei tei-q">“imitations,”</span> so to speak, in our
                physical organism.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Esotericism, pure and simple, speaks of no personal God;
                therefore are we considered as Atheists. But, in reality, Occult
                Philosophy, as a whole, is based absolutely on the ubiquitous
                presence of God, the
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg484"></a> Absolute Deity; and
                if
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">It</span></span>
                Itself is not speculated upon, as being too sacred and yet
                incomprehensible as a Unit to the finite intellect, yet the
                entire Philosophy is based upon Its Divine Powers as being the
                Source of all that breathes and lives and has existence. In
                every ancient Religion the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>
                was demonstrated by the many. In Egypt and India, in Chaldæa and
                Phœnicia, and finally in Greece, the ideas about Deity were
                expressed by multiples of three, five and seven; and also by
                eight, nine and twelve great Gods, which symbolized the powers
                and properties of the One and Only Deity. This was related to
                that infinite subdivision by irregular and odd numbers to which
                the metaphysics of these nations subjected their
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One Divinity</span></span>. Thus constituted, the cycle of the Gods had all the qualities
                and attributes of the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One Supreme and Unknowable</span></span>; for in this collection of divine Personalities, or rather of
                Symbols personified, dwells the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One God</span></span>, the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God One</span></span>, that God which, in India, is said to have no Second.

            </h2>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              As many have written and almost complained to me that they could
              find no practical clear application of certain diagrams appended
              to the first two Papers, and others have spoken of their
              abstruseness, a short explanation is necessary.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The reason of this difficulty in most cases has been that the
              point of view taken was erroneous; the purely abstract and
              metaphysical was mistaken for, and confused with, the concrete and
              the physical. Let us take for example the diagrams on page 477
              (Paper II.,) and say that these are entirely macrocosmic and
              ideal. It must be remembered that the study of Occultism proceeds
              from Universals to Particulars and not the reverse way, as
              accepted by Science. As Plato was an Initiate, he very naturally
              used the former method, while Aristotle, never having been
              initiated, scoffed at his master, and, elaborating a system of his
              own, left it as an heirloom to be adopted and improved by Bacon.
              Of a truth the aphorism of Hermetic Wisdom,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“As above, so below,”</span> applies to
              all Esoteric instruction; but we must begin with the above; we
              must learn the formula before we can sum the series.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The two figures, therefore, are not meant to represent any two
              particular planes, but are the abstraction of a pair of planes,
              explanatory of the law of reflection, just as the Lower Manas is a
              reflection of the Higher. They must therefore be taken in the
              highest metaphysical sense.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              The diagrams are only intended to familiarize students with the
              leading ideas of Occult correspondences, the very genius of
              metaphysical, or macrocosmic and spiritual Occultism forbidding
              the use of figures or even symbols further than as temporary aids.
              Once define an idea in words, and it loses its reality; once
              figure a metaphysical idea, and
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page487">[pg 487]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg487"></a> you materialize its
              spirit. Figures must be used only as ladders to scale the
              battlements, ladders to be disregarded when once the foot is set
              upon the rampart.
            </p>
            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
              Let students, therefore, be very careful to spiritualize the
              Papers and avoid materializing them; let them always try to find
              the highest meaning possible, confident that in proportion as they
              approach the material and visible in their speculations on the
              Papers, so far are they from the right understanding of them. This
              is especially the case with these first Papers and Diagrams, for
              as in all true arts, so in Occultism, we must first learn the
              theory before we are taught the practice.

                the beginning of every new human Race, and at the junctions or

                If you wish to know the real
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'être</span></span>
                for this policy, I now give it to you. No use my repeating and
                explaining what all of you know as well as myself; at the very
                beginning, events have shown that no caution can be dispensed
                with. Of our body of several hundred men and women, many did not
                seem to realize either the awful sacredness of the pledge (which
                some took at the end of their pen), or the fact that their
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personality</span></em>
                has to be entirely disregarded, when brought face to face with
                their
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Higher Self</span></span>; or that all their words and professions went for naught
                unless corroborated by actions. This was human nature, and no
                more; therefore it was passed leniently by, and a new lease
                accorded by the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Master</span></span>. But apart from this there is a danger lurking in the nature
                of the present cycle itself. Civilized humanity, however
                carefully guarded by its invisible Watchers, the Nirmânakâyas,
                who watch over our respective races and nations, is yet, owing
                to its collective Karma, terribly under the sway of the
                traditional opposers of the Nirmânakâyas—the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Brothers of the Shadow,”</span>
                embodied and disembodied; and this, as has already been told
                you, will last to the end of the first Kali Yuga cycle (1897),
                and a few years beyond, as the smaller dark cycle happens to
                overlap the great one. Thus, notwithstanding all precautions,
                terrible secrets are often revealed to entirely unworthy persons
                by the efforts of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Dark Brothers”</span> and their working
                on human brains. This is entirely owing to the simple fact that
                in certain privileged organisms, vibrations of the primitive
                truth put in motion by the Planetary Beings are set up, in what
                Western philosophy would term innate ideas, and Occultism
                <span class="tei tei-q">“flashes of genius.”</span><a href="#note_818" id="noteref_818" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">818</span></span></a>
                Some such idea based on eternal truth is awakened, and all that
                the watchful Powers can do is to prevent its entire revelation.

                Everything in this Universe of differentiated matter has its two
                aspects, the light and the dark side, and these two attributes

                one to use, the other to abuse. Every man may become a Botanist
                without apparent danger to his fellow-creatures; and many a
                Chemist who has mastered the science of essences knows that
                every one of them can both heal and kill. Not an ingredient, not
                a poison, but can be used for both purposes—aye, from harmless
                wax to deadly prussic acid, from the saliva of an infant to that
                of the cobra di capella. This every tyro in medicine
                knows—theoretically, at any rate. But where is the learned
                Chemist in our day who has been permitted to discover the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“night side”</span> of an attribute of
                any substance in the three kingdoms of Science, let alone in the
                seven of the Occultists? Who of them has penetrated into its
                Arcana, into the innermost Essence of things and its primary
                correlations? Yet it is this knowledge alone which makes of an
                Occultist a genuine practical Initiate, whether he turn out a
                Brother of Light or a Brother of Darkness. The essence of that
                subtle, traceless poison, the most potent in nature, which
                entered into the composition of the so-called Medici and Borgia
                poisons, if used with discrimination by one well versed in the
                septenary degrees of its potentiality on each of the planes
                accessible to man on earth—could heal or kill every man in the
                world; the result depending, of course, on whether the operator
                was a Brother of the Light or a Brother of the Shadow. The
                former is prevented from doing the good he might, by racial,
                national, and individual Karma; the second is impeded in his
                fiendish work by the joint efforts of the human
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Stones”</span> of the

              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                It is incorrect to think that there exists any special
                <span class="tei tei-q">“powder of projection”</span> or
                <span class="tei tei-q">“philosopher's stone,”</span> or
                <span class="tei tei-q">“elixir of life.”</span> The latter
                lurks in every flower, in every stone and mineral throughout the
                globe. It is the ultimate essence of
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">everything on its way to higher and higher evolution</span></em>. As there is no good or evil
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, so there is neither
                <span class="tei tei-q">“elixir of life”</span> nor
                <span class="tei tei-q">“elixir of death,”</span> nor poison,
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, but all this is contained in one and the same universal
                Essence, this or the other effect, or result, depending on the
                degree of its differentiation and its various correlations. The
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">light side</span></em>
                of it produces life, health, bliss, divine peace, etc.; the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dark side</span></em>
                brings death, disease, sorrow and strife. This is proven by the
                knowledge of the nature of the most violent poisons; of some of
                them even a large quantity will produce no evil effect on the
                organism, whereas a grain of the same poison kills with
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg490"></a> the rapidity of
                lightning; while the same grain, again, altered by a certain
                combination, though its quantity remains almost identical, will
                heal. The number of the degrees of its differentiation is
                septenary, as are the planes of its action, each degree being
                either beneficent or maleficent in its effects, according to the
                system into which it is introduced. He who is skilled in these
                degrees is on the high road to practical Adeptship; he who acts
                at hap-hazard—as do the enormous majority of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind Curers,”</span> whether
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Mental”</span> or
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Christian Scientists”</span>—is likely
                to rue the effects on himself as well as on others. Put on the
                track by the example of the Indian Yogîs, and of their broadly
                but incorrectly outlined practices, which they have only read
                about, but have had no opportunity to study—these new sects have
                rushed headlong and guideless into the practice of
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">denying</span></em>
                and
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">affirming</span></em>. Thus they have done more harm than good. Those who are
                successful owe it to their innate magnetic and healing powers,
                which very often counteract that which would otherwise be
                conducive to much evil. Beware, I say; Satan and the Archangel
                are more than twins; they are one body and one mind—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus est Demon inversus</span></span>.

                Such is another question often asked. I answer: Genuine
                concentration and meditation,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious and cautious</span></em>, upon one's lower self in the light of the inner divine man
                and the Pâramitâs, is an excellent thing. But to
                <span class="tei tei-q">“sit for Yoga,”</span> with only a
                superficial and often distorted knowledge of the real practice,
                is almost invariably fatal; for ten to one the student will
                either develop mediumistic powers in himself or lose time and
                get disgusted both with practice and theory. Before one rushes
                into such a dangerous experiment and seeks to go beyond a minute
                examination of one's lower self and
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em>
                walk in life, or that which is called in our phraseology,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“The Chelâ's Daily Life Ledger,”</span>
                he would do well to learn at least the difference between the
                two aspects of <span class="tei tei-q">“Magic,”</span> the White
                or Divine, and the Black or Devilish, and assure himself that by
                <span class="tei tei-q">“sitting for Yoga,”</span> with no
                experience, as well as with no guide to show him the dangers, he
                does not daily and hourly cross the boundaries of the Divine to
                fall into the Satanic. Nevertheless, the way to learn the
                difference is very easy; one has only to remember that
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no Esoteric truths entirely unveiled will ever be given in

                I ask students to turn to the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theosophist</span></span>
                of November, 1887. On
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg 491]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg491"></a> page 98 they will
                find the beginning of an excellent article by Mr. Râma Prasâd on
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature's Finer Forces.”</span><a href="#note_820" id="noteref_820" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">820</span></span></a>
                The value of this work is not so much in its literary merit,
                though it gained its author the gold medal of the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theosophist</span></span>, as in its exposition of tenets hitherto concealed in a rare
                and ancient Sanskrit work on Occultism. But Mr. Râma Prasâd is
                not an Occultist, only an excellent Sanskrit scholar, a
                university graduate and a man of remarkable intelligence. His
                essays are almost entirely based on Tântra works, which, if read
                indiscriminately by a tyro in Occultism, will lead to the
                practice of most unmitigated Black Magic. Now, since the
                difference of primary importance between Black and White Magic
                is the object with which it is practised, and that of secondary
                importance the nature of the agents used for the production of
                phenomenal results, the line of demarcation between the two is
                very—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>
                thin. The danger is lessened only by the fact that every
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Occult</span></em>
                book, so-called, is Occult only in a certain sense: that is, the
                text is Occult merely by reason of its blinds. The symbolism has
                to be thoroughly understood before the reader can get at the
                correct sense of the teaching. Moreover, it is never complete,
                its several portions each being under a different title, and
                each containing a portion of some other work; so that without a
                key to these no such work divulges the whole truth. Even the
                famous
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shivâgama</span></span>, on which
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natures Finer Forces</span></span>
                is based,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“is nowhere to be found in complete form,”</span>
                as the author tells us. Thus, like all others, it treats of only
                five Tattvas instead of the seven as in Esoteric teachings.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Now, the Tattvas being simply the substratum of the seven forces
                of Nature, how can this be? There are seven forms of Prakriti,
                as Kapila's Sânkhya, the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu Purâna</span></span>, and other works teach. Prakriti is Nature, Matter (primordial
                and elemental); therefore logic demands that the Tattvas also
                should be seven. For whether Tattvas mean, as Occultism teaches,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“forces of Nature,”</span> or, as the
                learned Râma Prâsad explains,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the substance out of which the universe is formed”</span>
                and
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the power by which it is sustained,”</span>
                it is all one; they
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page492">[pg 492]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg492"></a> are Force, Purusha,
                and
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>, Prakriti. And if the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forms</span></em>, or rather planes, of the latter are seven, then its forces
                must be seven also. In other words, the degrees of the solidity
                of matter and the degrees of the power that ensouls it must go
                hand in hand.

                by which they must not be misled. The doctrine of the seven
                Tattvas (the principles of the Universe and also of man) was
                held in great sacredness and therefore secrecy, in days of old,
                by the Brâhmans, who have now almost forgotten the teaching. Yet
                it is taught to this day in the Schools beyond the Himâlayan
                Range, though now hardly remembered or heard of in India except
                through rare Initiates. The policy has, however, been changed
                gradually; Chelâs began to be taught the broad outlines of it,
                and at the advent of the T. S. in India in 1879, I was ordered
                to teach it in its exoteric form to one or two. I now give it
                out Esoterically.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Knowing that some students try to follow a system of Yoga in
                their own fashion, guided only by the rare hints they find in
                Theosophical books and magazines, which must naturally be
                incomplete, I chose one of the best expositions upon ancient
                Occult works,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature's Finer Forces</span></span>, in order to point out how very easily one can be misled by
                their blinds.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The author seems to have been himself deceived. The Tantras read
                Esoterically are as full of wisdom as the noblest Occult works.
                Studied without a guide and applied to practice, they may lead
                to the production of various phenomenal results, on the moral
                and physiological planes. But let anyone accept their
                dead-letter rules and practices, let him try with some selfish
                motive in view to carry out the rites prescribed therein, and—he
                is lost. Followed with pure heart and unselfish devotion merely
                for the sake of experiment, either no results will follow, or
                such as can only throw back the performer. But woe to the
                selfish man who seeks to develop Occult powers only to
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg 493]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg493"></a> attain earthly
                benefits or revenge, or to satisfy his ambition; the separation
                of the Higher from the Lower Principles and the severing of
                Buddhi-Manas from the Tântrist's personality will speedily
                follow, the terrible Karmic results to the

                The Auric Egg, on account of its nature and manifold functions,

                Universal Forces, so the Auric Egg contains, and is directly
                related to, both the divine and the physical man. In its
                essence, as said, it is eternal; in its constant correlations
                and transformations, during the reincarnating progress of the
                Ego on this earth, it is a kind of perpetual motion machine.

                human Egos of this earth or plane, but become such only from the
                moment they ensoul the Animal Man, thus endowing him with his
                Higher Mind. Each is a
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath”</span> or Principle, called the
                Human Soul, or Manas, the Mind. As the teachings say:

                <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> of its immediately preceding

                Ego is indissolubly united with (or rather follows in the track
                of) the new Astral Form. Both are Karmically propelled towards
                the family or woman from whom is to be born the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal child</span></em>

                punishable sins and misdeeds of the last personality, is drawn
                into the woman. Once there, Nature models the fœtus of flesh
                around the Astral, out of the growing materials of the male seed
                in the female soil. Thus grows out of the essence of a decayed
                seed the fruit or eidolon of the dead seed, the physical fruit

                In Nature, then, we find seven Forces, or seven Centres of
                Force, and everything seems to respond to that number, as for
                instance, the septenary scale in music, or Sounds, and the
                septenary spectrum in Colours. I have not exhausted its
                nomenclature and proofs in the earlier volumes, yet enough is
                given to show every thinker that the facts adduced are no
                coincidences, but very weighty testimony.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                There are several reasons why only five Tattvas are given in the
                Hindu systems. One of these I have already mentioned; another is
                that owing to our having reached only the Fifth Race, and being
                (so far as Science is able to ascertain) endowed with only five
                senses, the two remaining senses that are still latent in man
                can have their existence proven only on phenomenal evidence
                which to the Materialist is no evidence at all. The five
                physical senses are made to correspond with the five lower
                Tattvas, the two yet undeveloped senses in man; and the two
                forces, or Tattvas, forgotten by Brâhmans and still unrecognized
                by Science, being so subjective and the highest of them so
                sacred, that they can only be recognized by, and known through,
                the highest Occult Sciences. It is easy to see that these two
                Tattvas and the two senses (the sixth and the seventh)
                correspond to the two highest human principles, Buddhi and the
                Auric Envelope, impregnated with the light of Âtmâ. Unless we
                open in ourselves, by Occult training, the sixth and seventh
                senses, we can never comprehend correctly their corresponding
                types. Thus the statement in
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature's Finer Forces</span></span>
                that, in the Tâttvic scale, the highest Tattva of all is
                Âkâsha<a href="#note_828" id="noteref_828" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">828</span></span></a>
                (followed by [only] four, each of which becomes grosser than its
                predecessor), if made from the Esoteric standpoint, is
                erroneous. For once Âkâsha, an almost homogeneous and certainly
                universal Principle, is translated Ether, then Âkâsha is dwarfed
                and limited to our visible Universe, for assuredly it is not the
                Ether of Space. Ether, whatever Modern Science makes of it, is
                differentiated Substance; Âkâsha, having no attributes save
                one—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sound</span></span>,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of which it is the substratum</span></em>—is no substance even exoterically and in the minds of some
                Orientalists,<a href="#note_829" id="noteref_829" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">829</span></span></a>
                but rather Chaos, or the Great Spatial Void.<a href="#note_830" id="noteref_830" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a>

                Esoterically, Âkâsha alone is
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Divine</span></em>
                Space, and becomes Ether only on the lowest and last plane, or
                our visible Universe and Earth. In this case the blind is in the
                word <span class="tei tei-q">“attribute,”</span> which is said
                to be Sound. But Sound is no attribute of Âkâsha, but its
                primary correlation, its primordial manifestation, the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Logos</span></span>, or Divine Ideation made Word, and that
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>”</span>
                made <span class="tei tei-q">“Flesh.”</span> Sound may be
                considered an <span class="tei tei-q">“attribute”</span> of
                Âkâsha only on the condition of anthropomorphizing the latter.
                It is not a characteristic of it, though it is certainly as
                innate in it as the idea
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I am
                  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em>”</span>
                is innate in our thoughts.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Occultism teaches that Âkâsha contains and includes the seven
                Centres of Force, therefore the six Tattvas, of which it is the
                seventh, or rather their synthesis. But if Âkâsha be taken, as
                we believe it is in this case, to represent only the exoteric
                idea, then the author is right; because, seeing that Âkâsha is
                universally omnipresent, following the Paurânic limitation,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the better comprehension of our finite intellects</span></em>, he places its commencement only beyond the four planes of our
                Earth Chain,<a href="#note_831" id="noteref_831" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a>
                the two higher Tattvas being as concealed to the average mortal
                as the sixth and seventh senses are to the materialistic mind.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Therefore, while Sanskrit and Hindu Philosophy generally speak
                of five Tattvas only, Occultists name seven, thus making them
                correspond with every septenary in Nature. The Tattvas stand in
                the same order as the seven macro- and micro-cosmic Forces: and
                as taught in Esotericism, are as follows:
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">

                manifestation, or of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“creative”</span> period, from the
                eternal immutable Sat, the substratum of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>. It corresponds with the Auric Envelope or Brahmâ's Egg, which
                surrounds every globe, as well as every man, animal and thing.
                It is the vehicle containing potentially everything—Spirit and
                Substance, Force and Matter. Âdi Tattva, in Esoteric Cosmogony,
                is the Force which we refer to as proceeding from the First or
                Unmanifested
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Logos</span></span>.

                an ideal one—or that which is born by transformation from
                something higher than itself. With the Occultists, this Force
                proceeds from the Second

                Philosophies and Religions start. Âkâsha Tattva is explained in
                them as Etheric Force, Ether. Hence Jupiter, the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“highest”</span> God, was named after
                Pater Æther; Indra, once the highest God in India, is the
                etheric or heavenly expanse, and so with Uranus, etc. The
                Christian biblical God, also, is spoken of as the Holy Ghost,
                Pneuma, rarefied wind or air. This the Occultists call the Force
                of the Third

                Now, what I have to say here is addressed especially to those
                members who are anxious to develop powers by
                <span class="tei tei-q">“sitting for Yoga.”</span> You have
                seen, from what has been already said, that in the development
                of Râja Yoga, no extant works made public are of the least good;
                they can at best give inklings of Hatha Yoga, something that may
                develop mediumship at best, and in the worst case—consumption.
                If those who practice
                <span class="tei tei-q">“meditation,”</span> and try to learn
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the Science of Breath,”</span> will
                read attentively
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature's Finer Forces</span></span>, they will find that it is by utilizing the five Tattvas only
                that this dangerous science is acquired. For in the exoteric
                Yoga Philosophy, and the Hatha Yoga practice, Âkâsha Tattva is
                placed in the head (or physical brain) of man; Tejas Tattva in
                the shoulders; Vâyu Tattva in the navel (the seat of all the
                phallic Gods, <span class="tei tei-q">“creators”</span> of the
                universe and man); Âpas Tattva in the knees; and Prithivî Tattva
                in the feet. Hence the two higher Tattvas and their
                correspondences are ignored and excluded; and, as these are the
                chief factors in Râja Yoga, no spiritual or intellectual
                phenomena of a high nature can take place. The best results
                obtainable will be physical phenomena and no more. As the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Five Breaths,”</span> or rather the
                five states of the human breath, in Hatha Yoga correspond to the
                above
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">terrestrial</span></em>
                planes and colours, what spiritual results can be obtained? On
                the contrary, they are the very reverse of the plane of Spirit,
                or the higher macrocosmic plane, reflected
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg500"></a> as they are upside
                down, in the Astral Light. This is proven in the Tântra work,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shivâgama</span></span>, itself. Let us compare.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                First of all, remember that the Septenary of visible and also
                invisible Nature is said in Occultism to consist of the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>
                (and four) Fires, which grow into the forty-nine Fires. This
                shows that as the Macrocosm is divided into seven great planes
                of various differentiations of Substance—from the spiritual or
                subjective, to the fully objective or material, from Akâsha down
                to the sin-laden atmosphere of our earth—so, in its turn, each
                of these great planes has three aspects, based on four
                Principles, as already shown above. This seems to be quite
                natural, as even modern Science has her three states of matter
                and what are generally called the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“critical”</span> or intermediate states
                between the solid, the fluidic, and the gaseous.

                Now, the Astral Light is not a universally diffused stuff, but
                pertains only to our earth and all other bodies of the system on
                the same plane of matter with it. Our Astral Light is, so to
                speak, the Linga Sharîra of our earth; only instead of being its
                primordial prototype, as in the case of our Chhâyâ, or Double,
                it is the reverse. Human and animal bodies grow and develop on
                the model of their antetypal Doubles; whereas the Astral Light
                is born from the terrene emanations, grows and develops after
                its prototypal parent, and in its treacherous waves everything
                from the upper planes and from the lower solid plane, the earth,
                both ways, is reflected
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reversed</span></em>. Hence the confusion of its colours and sounds in the
                clairvoyance and clairaudience of the sensitive who trusts to
                its records, be that sensitive a Hatha Yogî or a medium.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Such, then, is the Occult Science on which the modern Ascetics
                and Yogîs of India base their Soul development and powers. They
                are known as the Hatha Yogîs. Now, the science of Hatha Yoga
                rests upon the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“suppression of breath,”</span> or
                Prânâyâma, to which exercise our Masters are unanimously
                opposed. For what is Prânâyâma? Literally translated, it means
                the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“death of (vital) breath.”</span> Prâna,
                as said, is not Jîva, the eternal fount of life immortal; nor is
                it connected in any way with Pranava, as some think, for Pranava
                is a synonym of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aum</span></span>
                in a mystic sense. As much as has ever been taught publicly and
                clearly about it is to be found in
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nature's Finer Forces</span></span>. If such directions, however, are followed, they can only lead
                to Black Magic and mediumship. Several impatient Chelâs, whom we
                knew personally in India, went in for the practice of Hatha
                Yoga, notwithstanding our warnings. Of these, two developed
                consumption, of which one died; others became almost idiotic;
                another committed suicide; and one developed into a regular
                Tântrika, a Black Magician, but his career, fortunately for
                himself, was cut short by death.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The science of the Five Breaths, the moist, the fiery, the airy,
                etc., has a twofold significance and two applications. The
                Tântrikas take it literally, as relating to the regulation of
                the vital, lung breath, whereas the ancient Râja Yogîs
                understood it as referring to the mental or
                <span class="tei tei-q">“will”</span> breath, which alone leads
                to the highest clairvoyant powers, to the function of the Third
                Eye, and the acquisition of the true Râja Yoga Occult powers.
                The difference between the two is enormous. The former, as
                shown, use the five lower Tattvas; the latter begin by using the
                three higher alone, for mental and will development, and the
                rest only when they have completely mastered the three; hence,
                they use only one (Âkâsha Tattva) out of the Tântric five. As
                well said in the above stated work,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Tattvas are the modifications of Svara.”</span>
                Now, the Svara is the root of all sound, the substratum of the
                Pythagorean music of the spheres, Svara being that which is
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond</span></em>
                Spirit, in the modern acceptation of the word, the Spirit within
                Spirit, or as very properly translated, the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“current of the life-wave,”</span> the
                emanation of the One Life. The Great Breath spoken of in our
                first volume is
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Âtmâ</span></span>, the etymology of which is
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal motion</span></em>.”</span>
                Now while the ascetic Chelâ of our school, for his mental
                development, follows carefully the process of the evolution of
                the Universe, that is, proceeds from universals to particulars,
                the Hatha Yogî reverses the conditions and begins by sitting for
                the suppression
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg503"></a> of his (vital)
                breath. And if, as Hindu philosophy teaches, at the beginning of
                kosmic evolution,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Svara threw itself into the form of Âkâsha,”</span>
                and thence successively into the forms of Vâyu (air), Agni
                (fire), Âpas (water), and Prithivî (solid matter),<a href="#note_833" id="noteref_833" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a>
                then it stands to reason that we have to begin by the higher
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supersensuous</span></em>
                Tattvas. The Râja Yogî does not descend on the planes of
                substance beyond Sûkshma (subtle matter), while the Hatha Yogî
                develops and uses his powers only on the material plane. Some
                Tântrikas locate the three Nadîs, Sushumnâ, Îdâ and Pingalâ, in
                the medulla oblongata, the central line of which they call
                Sushumnâ, and the right and left divisions, Pingalâ and Îdâ, and
                also in the heart, to the divisions of which they apply the same
                names. The Trans-Himâlayan school of the ancient Indian Râja
                Yogîs, with which the modern Yogîs of India have little to do,
                locates Sushumnâ, the chief seat of these three Nadîs, in the
                central tube of the spinal cord, and Îdâ and Pingalâ on its left
                and right sides. Sushumnâ is the Brahmadanda. It is that canal
                (of the spinal cord), of the use of which Physiology knows no
                more than it does of the spleen and the pineal gland. Îâ and
                Pingalâ are simply the sharps and flats of that
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fa</span></span>
                of human nature, the keynote and the middle key in the scale of
                the septenary harmony of the Principles, which, when struck in a
                proper way, awakens the sentries on either side, the spiritual
                Manas and the physical Kâma, and subdues the lower through the
                higher. But this effect has to be produced by the exercise of
                will-power, not through the scientific or trained suppression of
                the breath. Take a transverse section of the spinal region, and
                you will find sections across three columns, one of which
                columns transmits the volitional orders, and a second a life
                current of Jîva—not of Prâna, which animates the body of
                man—during what is called Samâdhi and like states.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                He who has studied both systems, the Hatha and the Râja Yoga,
                finds an enormous difference between the two: one is purely
                psycho-physiological, the other purely psycho-spiritual. The
                Tântrists do not seem to go higher than the six visible and
                known plexuses, with each of which they connect the Tattvas; and
                the great stress they lay on the chief of these, the Mûladhâra
                Chakra (the sacral plexus), shows the material and selfish bent
                of their efforts towards the acquisition of powers. Their five
                Breaths and five Tattvas are chiefly concerned
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg 504]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg504"></a> with the prostatic,
                epigastric, cardiac, and laryngeal plexuses. Almost ignoring the
                Âjñâ, they are positively ignorant of the synthesizing laryngeal
                plexus. But with the followers of the old school it is
                different. We begin with the mastery of that organ which is
                situated at the base of the brain, in the pharynx, and called by
                Western Anatomists the Pituitary Body. In the series of the
                objective cranial organs, corresponding to the subjective
                Tâttvic principles, it stands to the Third Eye (Pineal Gland) as
                Manas stands to Buddhi; the arousing and awakening of the Third
                Eye must be performed by that vascular organ, that insignificant
                little body, of which, once again, Physiology knows nothing at
                all. The one is the Energizer of Will, the other that of
                Clairvoyant Perception.

                Those who are Physicians, Physiologists, Anatomists, etc., will

              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Now, as to the functions of the Pineal Gland, or Conarium, and
                of the Pituitary Body, we find no explanations vouchsafed by the
                standard authorities. Indeed, on looking through the works of
                the greatest specialists, it is curious to observe how much
                confused ignorance on the human vital economy, physiological as
                well as psychological, is openly confessed. The following is all
                that can be gleaned from the authorities upon these two
                important organs.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                (1) The Pineal Gland, or Conarium, is a rounded, oblong body,
                from three to four lines long, of a deep reddish grey, connected
                with the posterior part of the third ventricle of the brain. It
                is attached at its base by two thin medullary cords, which
                diverge forward to the Optic Thalami. Remember that the latter
                are found by the best Physiologists to be the organs of
                reception and condensation of the most sensitive and sensorial
                incitations from the periphery of the body (according to
                Occultism, from the periphery of the Auric Egg, which is our
                point of communication with the higher, universal planes). We
                are further told that the two bands of the Optic Thalami, which
                are inflected to meet each other, unite on the median line,
                where they become the two peduncles of the Pineal Gland.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                (2) The Pituitary Body, or Hypophysis Cerebri, is a small and
                hard organ, about six lines broad, three long and three high. It
                is formed of an anterior bean-shaped, and of a posterior and
                more rounded lobe, which are uniformly united. Its component
                parts, we are told, are almost identical with those of the
                Pineal Gland; yet not the slightest connection can be traced
                between the two centres. To this, however,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page505">[pg 505]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg505"></a> Occultists take
                exception; they
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em>
                that there is a connection, and this even anatomically and
                physically. Dissectors, on the other hand, have to deal with
                corpses; and, as they themselves admit, brain-matter, of all
                tissues and organs, collapses and changes form the soonest—in
                fact, a few minutes after death. When, then, the pulsating life
                which expanded the mass of the brain, filled all its cavities
                and energized all its organs, vanishes, the cerebral mass
                shrinks into a sort of pasty condition, and once open passages
                become closed. But the contraction and even interblending of
                parts in this process of shrinking, and the subsequent pasty
                state of the brain, do not imply that there is no connection
                between these two organs before death. In point of fact, as
                Professor Owen has shown, a connection as objective as a groove
                and tube exists in the crania of the human fœtus and of certain
                fishes. When a man is in his normal condition, an Adept can see
                the golden Aura pulsating in both the centres, like the
                pulsation of the heart, which never ceases throughout life. This
                motion, however, under the abnormal condition of effort to
                develop clairvoyant faculties, becomes intensified, and the Aura
                takes on a stronger vibratory or swinging action. The arc of the
                pulsation of the Pituitary Body mounts upward, more and more,
                until, just as when the electric current strikes some solid
                object, the current finally strikes the Pineal Gland, and the
                dormant organ is awakened and set all glowing with the pure
                Âkâshic Fire. This is the psycho-physiological illustration of
                two organs on the physical plane, which are, respectively, the
                concrete symbols of the metaphysical concepts called Manas and
                Buddhi. The latter, in order to become conscious on this plane,
                needs the more differentiated fire of Manas;
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but once the sixth sense has awakened the seventh</span></em>, the light which radiates from this seventh sense illumines
                the fields of infinitude. For a brief space of time man becomes
                omniscient; the Past and the Future, Space and Time, disappear
                and become for him the Present. If an Adept, he will store the
                knowledge he thus gains in his physical memory, and nothing,
                save the crime of indulging in Black Magic, can obliterate the
                remembrance of it. If only a Chelâ, portions alone of the whole
                truth will impress themselves on his memory, and he will have to
                repeat the process for years, never allowing one speck of
                impurity to stain him mentally or physically, before he becomes
                a fully initiated Adept.

                It may seem strange, almost incomprehensible, that the chief
                success of Gupta Vidyâ, or Occult Knowledge, should depend upon
                such flashes
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg506"></a> of clairvoyance, and
                that the latter should depend in man on two such insignificant

                classifying it with the absolutely useless atrophied organs, the
                relics of a previous and now utterly changed anatomy of man
                during some period of his unknown evolution. This

                This brilliant <span class="tei tei-q">“sand”</span> is the
                concretion of the gland itself, so say the Physiologists.
                Perhaps not, we answer. The Pineal Gland is that which the
                Eastern Occultist calls Devâksha, the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Eye.”</span> To this day, it is
                the chief organ of spirituality in the human brain, the seat of
                genius, the magical Sesame uttered by the purified will of the
                Mystic, which opens all the avenues of truth for him who knows
                how to use it. The Esoteric Science teaches that Manas, the Mind
                Ego, does not accomplish its full union with the child before he
                is six or seven years of age, before which period, even
                according to the canon of the Church and Law, no child is deemed
                responsible.<a href="#note_835" id="noteref_835" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">835</span></span></a>
                Manas becomes a prisoner, one with the body, only at that age.
                Now a strange thing was observed in several thousand cases by
                the famous German anatomist, Wengel. With a few extremely rare
                exceptions, this <span class="tei tei-q">“sand,”</span> or
                golden-coloured concretion, is found only in subjects after the
                completion of their seventh year. In the case of fools these
                calculi are very few; in congenital idiots they are completely
                absent. Morgagni,<a href="#note_836" id="noteref_836" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a>

                since they are the only Physiologists, so far,

                in young children, in very old people, and in idiots, and the
                unavoidable conclusion will be that they must be connected with

                composed of animal matter, phosphate of lime and carbonate,

                Our seven Chakras are all situated in the head, and it is these
                Master Chakras which govern and rule the seven (for there are
                seven) principal plexuses in the body, besides the forty-two
                minor ones to which Physiology refuses that name. The fact that
                no microscope can detect such centres on the objective plane
                goes for nothing; no microscope has ever yet detected, nor ever
                will, the difference between the motor and sensory nerve-tubes,
                the conductors of all our bodily and psychic sensations; and yet
                logic alone would show that such difference exists. And if the
                term plexus, in this application, does not represent to the
                Western mind the idea conveyed by the term of the Anatomist,
                then call them Chakras or Padmas, or the Wheels, the Lotus Heart
                and Petals. Remember that Physiology, imperfect as it is, shows
                septenary groups all over the exterior and interior of the body;
                the seven head orifices, the seven
                <span class="tei tei-q">“organs”</span> at the base of the
                brain, the seven plexuses, the pharyngeal, laryngeal, cavernous,

                whether the seven plexuses, or Tâttvic centres of action, are
                the centres where the seven Rays of the Logos vibrate, I answer
                in the affirmative, simply remarking that the rays of the Logos

                In these volumes it is almost revealed that the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Fohat”</span> are the
                personified Forces known in a general way as Motion, Sound,
                Heat, Light, Cohesion, Electricity or Electric Fluid, and
                Nerve-Force or Magnetism. This truth, however, cannot teach the
                student to attune and moderate the Kundalinî of the cosmic plane
                with the

                himself; for the one travels at the rate of about 90 feet, and
                the other at the rate of 115,000 leagues a second. The seven
                Shaktis respectively called Para Shakti, Jñâna Shakti, etc., are
                synonymous with the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Fohat,”</span> for they are
                their female aspects. At the present stage, however, as their
                names would only be confusing to the Western student, it is
                better to remember the English equivalents as translated above.
                As each Force is septenary, their sum is, of course, forty-nine.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The question now mooted in Science, whether a sound is capable
                of calling forth impressions of light and colour in addition to
                its natural sound impressions, has been answered by Occult
                Science ages ago. Every impulse or vibration of a physical
                object producing a certain vibration of the air, that is,
                causing the collision of physical particles, the sound of which
                is capable of affecting the ear, produces at the same time a
                corresponding flash of light, which will assume some particular
                colour. For, in the realm of hidden Forces, an
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">audible</span></em>
                sound is but a subjective colour; and a perceptible colour, but
                an
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inaudible</span></em>
                sound; both proceed from the same potential substance, which
                Physicists used to call ether, and now refer to under various
                other names; but which we call plastic, through invisible
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Space</span></span>. This may appear a paradoxical hypothesis, but facts are there
                to prove it. Complete deafness, for instance, does not preclude
                the possibility of discerning sounds; medical science has
                several cases on record which prove that these sounds are
                received by, and conveyed to, the patient's organ of sight,
                through the mind, under the form of chromatic impressions. The
                very fact that the intermediate tones of the chromatic musical
                scale were formerly written in colours shows an unconscious
                reminiscence of the ancient Occult teaching that colour and
                sound are two out of the seven correlative aspects,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on our plane</span></em>, of one and the same thing,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, Nature's first differentiated Substance.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Here is an example of the relation of colour to vibration well
                worthy of the attention of Occultists. Not only Adepts and
                advanced Chelâs, but also the lower order of Psychics, such as
                clairvoyants and psychometrists, can perceive a psychic Aura of
                various colours around every individual, corresponding to the
                temperament of the person within it. In other words, the
                mysterious records within the Auric Egg are not the heirloom of
                trained Adepts alone, but sometimes also of natural Psychics.
                Every human passion, every thought and quality, is indicated
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg509"></a> in this Aura by
                corresponding colours and shades of colour, and certain of these
                are sensed and felt rather than perceived. The best of such
                Psychics, as shown by Galton, can also perceive colours produced
                by the vibrations of musical instruments, every note suggesting
                a different colour. As a string vibrates and gives forth an
                audible note, so the nerves of the human body vibrate and thrill
                in correspondence with various emotions under the general
                impulse of the circulating vitality of Prâna, thus producing
                undulations in the psychic Aura of the person which result in
                chromatic effects.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The human nervous system as a whole, then, may be regarded as an
                Æolian Harp, responding to the impact of the vital force, which
                is no abstraction, but a dynamic reality, and manifests the
                subtlest shades of the individual character in colour phenomena.
                If these nerve vibrations are made intense enough and brought
                into vibratory relation with an astral element, the result
                is—sound. How, then, can anyone doubt the relation between the
                microcosmic and macrocosmic forces?

                Râma Prâsad, and other Yoga treatises of the same character
                which have appeared from time to time in Theosophical
                journals—for note well that those of true Râja Yoga are never
                published—tend to Black Magic and are most dangerous to take for
                guides in self-training, I hope that students will be on their

                human Auric Egg, as it is also outside the Macrocosmic or
                Brahmâ's Egg. Why? Because, though every particle and atom are,
                so to speak, cemented with and soaked through by this Paramâtmic
                essence, yet it is wrong to call it a
                <span class="tei tei-q">“human”</span> or even a
                <span class="tei tei-q">“universal”</span> Principle, for the
                term is very likely to give rise to naught but an erroneous idea
                of the philosophical and purely metaphysical concept; it is not
                a Principle, but the cause of every Principle, the latter term
                being applied by Occultists only to its shadow—the Universal
                Spirit that ensouls the boundless Kosmos whether within or
                beyond Space and Time.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Buddhi serves as a vehicle for that Paramâtmic shadow. This
                Buddhi <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page511">[pg 511]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg511"></a> is universal, and so
                also is the human Âtmâ. Within the Auric Egg is the macracosmic
                pentacle of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Life</span></span>, Prâna, containing within itself the pentagram which
                represents man. The universal pentacle must be pictured with its
                point soaring upwards, the sign of White Magic—in the human
                pentacle it is the lower limbs which are upward, forming the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Horns of Satan,”</span> as the
                Christian Kabbalists call them. This is the symbol of Matter,
                that of the personal man, and the recognized pentacle of the
                Black Magician. For this reversed pentacle does not stand only
                for Kâma, the fourth Principle exoterically, but it also
                represents physical man, the animal of flesh with its desires
                and passions.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Now, mark well, in order to understand that which follows, that
                Manas may be pictured as an upper triangle connected with the
                lower Manas by a thin line which binds the two together. This is
                the Antah-karana, that path or bridge of communication which
                serves as a link between the personal being whose physical brain
                is under the sway of the lower animal mind, and the
                reincarnating Individuality, the spiritual Ego, Manas, Manu, the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Man.”</span> This thinking Manu
                alone is that which reincarnates. In truth and in nature, the
                two Minds, the spiritual and the physical or animal, are one,
                but separate into two at reincarnation. For while that portion
                of the Divine which goes to animate the personality, consciously
                separating itself, like a dense but pure shadow, from the Divine
                Ego,<a href="#note_841" id="noteref_841" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a>
                wedges itself into the brain and senses<a href="#note_842" id="noteref_842" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a>
                of the fœtus, at the completion of its seventh month, the Higher
                Manas does not unite itself with the child before the completion
                of the first seven years of its life. This detached essence, or
                rather the reflection or shadow of the Higher Manas, becomes, as
                the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg 512]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg512"></a> child grows, a
                distinct thinking Principle in man, its chief agent being the
                physical brain. No wonder the Materialists, who perceive only
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
                <span class="tei tei-q">“rational soul,”</span> or mind, will
                not disconnect it with the brain and matter. But Occult
                Philosophy has ages ago solved the problem of mind, and
                discovered the duality of Manas. The Divine Ego tends with its
                point upwards towards Buddhi, and the human Ego gravitates
                downwards, immersed in Matter, connected with its higher,
                subjective half only by the Antahkarana. As its derivation
                suggests, this is the only connecting link during life between
                the two minds—the higher consciousness of the Ego and the human
                intelligence of the lower mind.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                To understand this abstruse metaphysical doctrine fully and
                correctly, one has to be thoroughly impressed with an idea,
                which I have in vain endeavoured to impart to Theosophists at
                large, namely, the great axiomatic truth that the only eternal
                and living Reality is that which the Hindus call Paramâtmâ and
                Parabrahman. This is the one ever-existing Root Essence,
                immutable and unknowable to our physical senses, but manifest
                and clearly perceptible to our spiritual natures. Once imbued
                with that basic idea and the further conception that if It is
                omnipresent, universal and eternal, like abstract Space itself,
                we must have emanated from It and we must, some day, return into
                It, and all the rest becomes easy.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                If so, then it stands to reason that life and death, good and
                evil, past and future, are all empty words, or at best, figures
                of speech. If the objective Universe itself is but a passing
                illusion on account of its beginning and finitude, then both
                life and death must also be aspects and illusions. They are
                changes of state, in fact, and no more. Real life is in the
                spiritual consciousness of that life,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in a conscious existence in Spirit, not Matter</span></em>; and real death is the limited perception of life, the
                impossibility of sensing conscious or even individual existence
                outside of form, or at least, of some form of Matter. Those who
                sincerely reject the possibility of conscious life divorced from
                Matter and brain-substance, are
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead units</span></em>. The words of Paul, an Initiate, become comprehensible.
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye are dead, and your
                  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life</span></em>

                which is to say: Ye are personally dead matter, unconscious of
                its own spiritual essence, and your real life is hid with your
                Divine Ego (Christos) in, or merged with, God (Âtmâ); now has it

                This is the first lesson to learn. The second is to study well
                the Principles of both the Kosmos and ourselves, dividing the
                group into the permanent and the impermanent, the higher and

                Remember the teaching: The Human Soul, lower Manas, is the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>
                and direct mediator between the personality and the Divine Ego.
                That which goes to make up on this earth the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personality</span></em>
                miscalled
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">individuality</span></em>
                by the majority, is the sum of all its mental, physical, and
                spiritual characteristics, which, being impressed on the Human
                Soul, produces the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>. Now, of all these characteristics it is the purified thoughts
                alone which can be impressed on the higher, immortal Ego. This
                is done by the Human Soul merging again, in its essence, into
                its parent source, commingling with its Divine Ego during life,
                and re-uniting itself entirely with it after the death of the
                physical man. Therefore, unless Kâma-Manas transmits to
                Buddhi-Manas such personal ideations, and such consciousness of
                its <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> as can be assimilated by
                the Divine Ego, nothing of that
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> or personality can survive in
                the Eternal. Only that which is worthy of the immortal God
                within us, and identical in its nature with the divine
                quintessence, can survive; for in this case it is its own, the
                Divine Ego's, <span class="tei tei-q">“shadows”</span> or
                emanations which ascend to it and are indrawn by it into itself
                again, to become once more part of its own Essence. No noble
                thought, no grand aspiration, desire, or divine immortal love,
                can come into the brain of the man of clay and settle there,
                except as a direct emanation from the Higher to, and through,
                the lower Ego; all the rest, intellectual as it may seem,
                proceeds from the <span class="tei tei-q">“shadow,”</span> the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower mind</span></em>, in its association and commingling with Kâma, and passes away
                and disappears for ever. But the mental and spiritual ideations
                of the personal <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> return to it,
                as parts of the Ego's Essence, and can never fade out. Thus of
                the personality that was, only its spiritual experiences, the
                memory of all that is good and noble, with the consciousness of
                its <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> blended with that of all
                the other personal <span class="tei tei-q">“I's”</span> that
                preceded it, survive and become immortal.
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page515">[pg 515]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg515"></a> There is no distinct
                or separate immortality for the men of earth outside of the Ego
                which informed them. That Higher Ego is the sole bearer of all
                its
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alter egos</span></em>
                on earth and their sole representative in the mental state
                called Devachan. As the last embodied personality, however, has
                a right to its own special state of bliss, unalloyed and free
                from the memories of all others, it is the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">last life only which is fully and realistically vivid</span></em>. Devachan is often compared to the happiest day in a series of

                the life of a person. The intensity of its happiness makes the
                man entirely forget all others, his past becoming obliterated.

                This is what we call the Devachanic state, the reward of the
                personality, and it is on this old teaching that the hazy
                Christian notion of Paradise was built, borrowed with many other
                things from the Egyptian Mysteries, wherein the doctrine was
                enacted. And this is the meaning of the passage quoted in
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis</span></span>. The Soul has triumphed over Apophis, the Dragon of Flesh.
                Henceforth, the personality will live in eternity, in its
                highest and noblest elements, the memory of its past deeds,
                while the <span class="tei tei-q">“characteristics”</span> of
                the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dragon”</span> will be fading out
                in Kâma Loka. If the question be asked,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“How live in eternity, when Devachan lasts but from 1,000 to
                  2,000 years,”</span>
                the answer is:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“In the same way as the recollection of each day which is
                  worth remembering lives in the memory of each one of
                  us.”</span>
                For the sake of an example, the days passed in one personal life
                may be taken as an illustration of each personal life, and this
                or that person may stand for the Divine Ego.

                To obtain the key which will open the door of many a
                psychological mystery it is sufficient to understand and
                remember that which precedes and that which follows. Many a
                Spiritualist has felt terribly indignant on being told that
                personal immortality was
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conditional</span></em>; and yet such is the philosophical and logical fact. Much has
                been said already on the subject, but no one to this day seems
                to have fully understood the doctrine. Moreover, it is not
                enough to know that such a fact is said to exist. All Occultist,
                or he who would become one, must know
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>
                it is so; for having learned and comprehended the
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">raison d'étre</span></span>, it becomes easier to set others right in their erroneous
                speculations, and, most important of all, it affords one an
                opportunity, without saying too much, to teach other people to
                avoid a calamity which, sad to say, occurs in our age almost
                daily. This calamity will now be explained at length.

                One must know little indeed of the Eastern modes of expression
                to fail to see in the passage quoted from the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the Dead</span></span>, and the pages of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis</span></span>, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) an allegory for the uninitiated, containing our Esoteric
                teaching; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that the two terms
                <span class="tei tei-q">“second death”</span> and
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul”</span> are, in one sense, blinds.
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul”</span> refers indifferently to
                Buddhi-Manas and Kâma-Manas. As to the term
                <span class="tei tei-q">“second death,”</span> the qualification
                <span class="tei tei-q">“second”</span> applies to several
                deaths which have to be undergone by the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Principles”</span> during their
                incarnation, Occultists alone understanding fully the sense in
                which such a statement is made. For we have (1) the death of the
                Body; (2) the death of the Animal Soul in Kâma Loka; (3) the
                death of the Astral Linga Sharîra, following that of the Body;
                (4) the metaphysical death of the Higher Ego, the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immortal</span></em>, every time it
                <span class="tei tei-q">“falls into matter,”</span> or
                incarnates in a new personality. The Animal Soul, or lower
                Manas, that shadow of the Divine Ego which separates from it to
                inform the personality, cannot by any possible means
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">escape death</span></em>
                in Kâma Loka, at any rate that portion of this reflection which
                remains as a terrestrial residue and cannot be impressed on the
                Ego. Thus the chief and most important secret with regard to
                that <span class="tei tei-q">“second death,”</span> in the
                Esoteric teaching, was and is to this day the terrible
                possibility of the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">death</span></em>
                of the Soul, that is, its severance from the Ego on earth during
                a person's lifetime. This is a
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
                death (though with chances of resurrection), which shows no
                traces in a person and yet leaves him morally a living corpse.
                It is difficult to see why this teaching should have been
                preserved until now with such secrecy, when, by spreading it
                among people, at any rate among those who believe in
                reincarnation, so much good might be done. But so it was, and I
                had no right to question the wisdom of the prohibition, but have
                given it hitherto, as it was given to myself,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">under pledge</span></em>
                not to reveal it to the world at large. But now I have
                permission to give it to all, revealing its tenets first to the
                Esotericists, and then when they have assimilated them
                thoroughly it will be their duty to teach others this special
                tenet of the <span class="tei tei-q">“second death,”</span> and
                warn all the Theosophists of its dangers.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                To make the teaching clearer, I shall seemingly have to go over
                old ground; in reality, however, it is given out with new light
                and new details. I have tried to hint at it in the

                it, point by point.

                (1) Imagine, for illustration's sake, the one homogeneous,
                absolute and omnipresent Essence, above the upper step of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“stair of the seven planes of worlds,”</span>
                ready to start on its evolutionary journey. As its correlating
                reflection gradually descends, it differentiates and transforms
                into subjective, and finally into objective matter. Let us call
                it at its north pole Absolute Light; at its south pole, which to
                us would be the fourth or middle step, or plane, counting either
                way, we know it Esoterically as the One and Universal Life. Now
                mark the difference. Above,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Light</span></span>; below,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Life</span></em>. The former is ever immutable, the latter manifests under the
                aspects of countless differentiations. According to the Occult
                law, all potentialities included in the higher become
                differentiated reflections in the lower; and according to the
                same law, nothing which is differentiated can be blended with
                the homogeneous.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Again, nothing can endure of that which lives and breathes and
                has its being in the seething waves of the world, or plane of
                differentiation. Thus Buddhi and Manas being both primordial
                rays of the One Flame, the former the vehicle, the upâdhi or
                vâhana, of the one eternal Essence, the latter the vehicle of
                Mahat or Divine Ideation (Mahâ-Buddhi in the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>), the Universal Intelligent Soul—neither of them, as such, can
                become extinct or be annihilated, either in essence or
                consciousness. But the physical personality with its Linga
                Sharîra, and the animal soul, with its Kâma,<a href="#note_844" id="noteref_844" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a>
                can and do become so. They are born in the realm of illusion,
                and must vanish like a fleecy cloud from the blue and eternal
                sky.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                He who has read these volumes with any degree of attention, must
                know the origin of the human Egos, called Monads, generically,
                and what they were before they were forced to incarnate in the
                human animal. The divine beings whom Karma led to act in the
                drama of Manvantaric life, are entities from higher and earlier
                worlds and planets, whose Karma had not been exhausted when
                their world went into Pralaya. Such is the teaching; but whether
                it is so or not, the Higher Egos are—as compared to such forms
                of transitory, terrestrial mud as ourselves—Divine Beings, Gods,
                immortal throughout the Mahâmanvantara, or the
                311,040,000,000,000 years during which the Age of Brahmâ lasts.
                And as the Divine Egos, in
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page518">[pg 518]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg518"></a> order to re-become
                the One Essence, or be indrawn again into the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aum</span></span>, have to purify themselves in the fire of suffering and
                individual experience, so also have the terrestrial Egos, the
                personalities, to do likewise, if they would partake of the
                immortality of the Higher Egos. This they can achieve by
                crushing in themselves all that benefits only the lower personal
                nature of their <span class="tei tei-q">“selves”</span> and by
                aspiring to transfuse their thinking Kâmic Principle into that
                of the Higher Ego. We (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, our personalities) become immortal by the mere fact of our
                thinking moral nature being grafted on our Divine Triune Monad,
                Âtmâ-Buddhi-Manas, the three in one and one in three (aspects).
                For the Monad manifested on earth by the incarnating Ego is that
                which is called the Tree of Life Eternal, that can only be
                approached by eating the fruit of knowledge, the Knowledge of
                Good and Evil, or of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gnosis</span></span>, Divine Wisdom.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                In the Esoteric teachings, this Ego is the fifth Principle in
                man. But the student who has read and understood the first two
                Papers, knows something more. He is aware that the seventh is
                not a human, but a universal Principle in which man
                participates; but so does equally every physical and subjective
                atom, and also every blade of grass and everything that lives or
                is in Space, whether it be sensible of it or not. He knows,
                moreover, that if man is more closely connected with it, and
                assimilates it with a hundredfold more power, it is simply
                because he is endowed with the highest consciousness on this
                earth; that man, in short, may become a Spirit, a Deva, or a
                God, in his next transformation, whereas neither a stone nor a
                vegetable, nor an animal, can do so before they become men in
                their proper turn.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                (2) Now what are the functions of Buddhi? On this plane it has
                none, unless it is united with Manas, the conscious Ego. Buddhi
                stands to the divine Root Essence in the same relation as
                Mûlaprakriti to Parabrahman, in the Vedânta School; or as Alaya
                the Universal Soul to the One Eternal Spirit, or that which is
                beyond Spirit. It is its human vehicle, one remove from that
                Absolute, which can have no relation whatever to the finite and
                the conditioned.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                (3) What, again, is Manas and its functions? In its purely
                metaphysical aspect, Manas, though one remove on the downward
                plane from Buddhi, is still so immeasurably higher than the
                physical man, that it cannot enter into direct relation with the
                personality, except through its reflection, the lower mind.
                Manas is
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spiritual Self-Consciousness</span></span>
                in itself, and Divine Consciousness when united with Buddhi,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg 519]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg519"></a> which is the true
                <span class="tei tei-q">“producer”</span> of that
                <span class="tei tei-q">“production”</span> (vikâra), or
                Self-Consciousness, through Mahat. Buddhi-Manas, therefore, is
                entirety unfit to manifest during its periodical incarnations,
                except through the human mind or lower Manas. Both are linked
                together and are inseparable, and can have as little to do with
                the lower Tanmâtras,<a href="#note_845" id="noteref_845" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a>
                or rudimentary atoms, as the homogeneous with the heterogeneous.
                It is, therefore, the task of the lower Manas, or thinking
                personality, if it would blend itself with its God, the Divine
                Ego, to dissipate and paralyze the Tanmâtras, or properties of
                the material form. Therefore, Manas is shown double, as the Ego
                and Mind of Man. It is Kâma-Manas, or the lower Ego, which,
                deluded into a notion of independent existence, as the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“producer”</span> in its turn and the
                sovereign of the five Tanmâtras, becomes
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego-ism</span></em>, the selfish Self, in which case it has to be considered as
                Mahâbhûtic and finite, in the sense of its being connected with
                Ahankâra, the personal
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I-creating”</span> faculty. Hence

                (4) Antahkarana is the name of that imaginary bridge, the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">path</span></em>
                which lies between the Divine and the human Egos, for they are
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Egos</span></em>, during human life, to re-become
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
                Ego in Devachan or Nirvâna. This may seem difficult to
                understand, but in reality, with the help of a familiar, though
                fanciful illustration, it becomes quite simple. Let us figure to
                ourselves a bright lamp in the middle of a room, casting its
                light upon the wall. Let the lamp represent the Divine Ego, and
                the light thrown on the wall the lower Manas, and let the wall
                stand for the body. That portion of the atmosphere which
                transmits the ray from the lamp to the wall, will then represent
                the Antahkarana. We must further suppose that the light thus
                cast is endowed with reason and intelligence, and
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg520"></a> possesses, moreover,
                the faculty of dissipating all the evil shadows which pass
                across the wall, and of attracting all brightnesses to itself,
                receiving their indelible impressions. Now, it is in the power
                of the human Ego to chase away the shadows, or sins, and
                multiply the brightnesses, or good deeds, which make these
                impressions, and thus through Antahkarana, ensure its own
                permanent connection, and its final re-union, with the Divine
                Ego. Remember that the latter cannot take place while there
                remains a single taint of the terrestrial, or of matter, in the
                purity of that light. On the other hand, the connection cannot
                be entirely ruptured, and final re-union prevented, so long as
                there remains one spiritual deed, or potentiality to serve as a
                thread of union; but the moment this last spark is extinguished,
                and the last potentiality exhausted, then comes the severance.
                In an Eastern parable, the Divine Ego is likened to the Master
                who sends out his labourers to till the ground and to gather in
                the harvest, and who is content to keep the field so long as it
                can yield even the smallest return. But when the ground becomes
                absolutely sterile, not only is it abandoned, but the labourer
                also (the lower Manas) perishes.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                On the other hand, however, still using our simile, when the
                light thrown on the wall, or the rational human Ego, reaches the
                point of actual spiritual exhaustion, the Antahkarana
                disappears, no more light is transmitted, and the lamp becomes
                non-existent to the ray. The light which has been absorbed
                gradually disappears and
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul eclipse”</span> occurs; the being
                lives on earth and then passes into Kâma Loka as a mere
                surviving congeries of material qualities; it can never pass
                onwards towards Devachan, but is reborn immediately, a human
                animal and scourge.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                This simile, however fantastic, will help us to seize the
                correct idea. Save through the blending of the moral nature with
                the Divine Ego, there is no immortality for the personal Ego. It
                is only the most spiritual emanations of the personal Human Soul
                which survive. Having, during a lifetime, been imbued with the
                notion and feeling of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I am I”</span> of its personality, the
                Human Soul, the bearer of the very essence of the Karmic deeds
                of the physical man, becomes, after the death of the latter,
                part and parcel of the Divine Flame, the Ego. It becomes
                immortal through the mere fact that it is now strongly grafted
                on the Monad, which is the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Tree of Life Eternal.”</span>
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                And now we must speak of the tenet of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“second death.”</span> What happens to
                the Kâmic Human Soul, which is always that of a debased
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg521"></a> and wicked man or of
                a soulless person? This mystery will now be explained.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The personal Soul in this case,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, in that of one who has never had a thought not concerned with
                the animal self, having nothing to transmit to the Higher, or to
                add to the sum of the experiences gleaned from past incarnations
                which its memory is to preserve throughout eternity—this
                personal Soul becomes separated from the Ego. It can graft
                nothing of self on that eternal trunk whose sap throws out
                millions of personalities, like leaves from its branches, leaves
                which wither, die and fall at the end of their season. These
                personalities bud, blossom forth and expire, some without
                leaving a trace behind, others after commingling their own life
                with that of the parent stem. It is the Souls of the former
                class that are doomed to annihilation, or Avîtchi, a state so
                badly understood, and still worse described by some Theosophical
                writers, but which is not only located on our earth, but is in
                fact this very earth itself.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Thus we see that Antahkarana has been destroyed before the lower
                man has had an opportunity of assimilating the Higher and
                becoming at one with it; and therefore the Kâmic
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul”</span> becomes a separate entity,
                to live henceforth, for a short or long period according to its
                Karma, as a <span class="tei tei-q">“soulless”</span> creature.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                But before I elaborate this question, I must explain more
                clearly the meaning and functions of the Antahkarana. As already
                said, it may be represented as a narrow bridge connecting the
                Higher and the lower Manas. If you look at the Glossary of the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Voice of the Silence</span></span>, pp. 88 and 89, you will find that it is a projection of the
                lower Manas, or, rather, the link between the latter and the
                Higher Ego, or, between the Human and the Divine or Spiritual
                Soul.<a href="#note_847" id="noteref_847" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a>

                Spiritualists see sometimes appearing in the séance rooms as
                materialized <span class="tei tei-q">“forms,”</span> which they
                foolishly mistake for the

                So far is this from being
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg522"></a> the case, that in
                dreams, though Antahkarana is there, the personality is only
                half awake; therefore, Antahkarana is said to be
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">drunk</span></em>
                or
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insane</span></em>
                during our normal sleeping state. If such is the case during the
                periodical death, or sleep, of the living body, one may judge
                what the consciousness of Antahkarana is like when it has been
                transformed after the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“eternal sleep”</span> into Kâma Rûpa.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                But to return. In order not to confuse the mind of the Western
                student with the abstruse difficulties of Indian metaphysics,
                let him view the lower Manas, or Mind, as the personal Ego
                during the waking state, and as Antahkarana only during those
                moments when it aspires towards its Higher Ego, and thus becomes
                the medium of communication between the two. It is for this
                reason that it is called the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Path.”</span> Now, when a limb or organ
                belonging to the physical organism is left in disuse, it becomes
                weak and finally atrophies. So also is it with mental faculties;
                and hence the atrophy of the lower mind-function, called
                Antahkarana, becomes comprehensible in both completely
                materialistic and depraved natures.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                According to Esoteric Philosophy, however, the teaching is as
                follows: Seeing that the faculty and function of Antahkarana is
                as necessary as the medium of the ear for hearing, or that of
                the eye for seeing; then so long as the feeling of Ahankâra,
                that is, of the personal <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> or
                selfishness, is not entirely crushed out in a man, and the lower
                mind not entirely merged into and become one with the Higher
                Buddhi-Manas, it stands to reason that to destroy Antahkarana is
                like destroying a bridge over an impassable chasm;
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the traveller can never reach the goal on the other
                    shore</span></em>. And here lies the difference between the exoteric and
                Esoteric teaching. The former makes the Vedânta state that so
                long as Mind (the lower) clings through Antahkarana to Spirit
                (Buddhi-Manas) it is impossible for it to acquire true Spiritual
                Wisdom, Gnyâna, and that this can only be attained by seeking to
                come
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">en rapport</span></span>
                with the Universal Soul (Âtmâ); that, in fact, it is by ignoring
                the Higher Mind altogether that one reaches Râja Yoga. We say it
                is not so. No single rung of the ladder leading to knowledge can
                be skipped. No personality can ever reach or bring itself into
                communication with Âtmâ, except through Buddhi-Manas; to try and
                become a Jîvanmukta or a Mahâtmâ, before one has become an Adept
                or even a Narjol (a sinless man) is like trying to reach Ceylon
                from India without crossing the sea. Therefore we are told that
                if we destroy Antahkarana before the personal is absolutely
                under the control
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page523">[pg 523]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg523"></a> of the impersonal
                Ego, we risk to lose the latter and be severed for ever from it,
                unless indeed we hasten to re-establish the communication by a
                supreme and final effort.

                It is only when we are indissolubly linked with the essence of

                mean simply discontinuation of human life on earth, for earth is
                Avîtchi, and the worst Avîtchi possible. Expelled for ever from
                the consciousness of the Individuality, the reincarnating Ego,
                the physical atoms and psychic vibrations of the now separate
                personality are immediately reincarnated on the same earth, only
                in a lower and still more abject creature, a human being only in
                form, doomed to Karmic torments during the whole of its new
                life. Moreover, if it persists in its criminal or debauched
                course, it will suffer a long series of immediate
                reincarnations.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Here two questions present themselves: (1) What becomes of the
                Higher Ego in such cases? (2) What kind of an animal is a human
                creature born soulless?
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Before answering these two very natural queries, I have to draw
                the attention of all of you who are born in Christian countries
                to the fact that the romance of the vicarious atonement and the
                mission of Jesus,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page524">[pg 524]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg524"></a>
                as it now stands, was drawn or borrowed by some too liberal
                Initiates from the mysterious and weird tenet of the earthly
                experience of the reincarnating Ego. The latter is indeed the
                sacrificial victim of, and through, its own Karma in previous
                Manvantaras, which takes upon itself voluntarily the duty of
                saving what would be otherwise soulless men or personalities.
                Eastern truth is thus more philosophical and logical than
                Western fiction. The Christos, or Buddhi-Manas of each man is
                not quite an innocent and sinless God, though in one sense it is
                the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> being of the same
                essence with the Universal Spirit, and at the same time the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Son,”</span> for Manas is the second
                remove from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Father.”</span> By
                incarnation the Divine Son makes itself responsible for the sins
                of all the personalities which it will inform. This it can do
                only through its proxy or reflection, the lower Manas. The only
                case in which the Divine Ego can escape individual penalty and
                responsibility as a guiding Principle, is when it has to break
                off from the personality, because matter, with its psychic and
                astral vibrations, is then, by the very intensity of its
                combinations, placed beyond the control of the Ego. Apophis, the
                Dragon, having become the conqueror, the reincarnating Manas,
                separating itself gradually from its tabernacle, breaks finally
                asunder from the psycho-animal Soul.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Thus, in answer to the first question, I say:
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                (1) The Divine Ego does one of two things: either (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) it recommences immediately under its own Karmic impulses a
                fresh series of incarnations; or (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) it seeks and finds refuge in the bosom of the Mother, Alaya,
                the Universal Soul, of which the Manvantaric aspect is Mahat.
                Freed from the life-impressions of the personality, it merges
                into a kind of Nirvânic interlude, wherein there can be nothing
                but the eternal Present, which absorbs the Past and Future.
                Bereft of the <span class="tei tei-q">“labourer,”</span> both
                field and harvest now being lost, the Master, in the infinitude
                of his thought, naturally preserves no recollection of the
                finite and evanescent illusion which had been his last
                personality. And then, indeed, is the latter annihilated.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                (2) The future of the lower Manas is more terrible, and still
                more terrible to humanity than to the now animal man. It
                sometimes happens that after the separation the exhausted Soul,
                now become supremely animal, fades out in Kâma Loka, as do all
                other animal souls. But seeing that the more material is the
                human mind, the longer it lasts, even in the intermediate stage,
                it frequently happens that after the present life of the
                soulless man is ended, he is again and again
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page525">[pg 525]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg525"></a> reincarnated into new
                personalities, each one more abject than the other. The impulse
                of
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal life</span></em>
                is too strong; it cannot wear itself out in one or two lives
                only. In rarer cases, however, when the lower Manas is doomed to
                exhaust itself by
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">starvation</span></em>; when there is no longer hope that even a remnant of a lower
                light will, owing to favourable conditions—say, even a short
                period of spiritual aspiration and repentance—attract back to
                itself its Parent Ego, and Karma leads the Higher Ego back to
                new incarnations, then something far more dreadful may happen.
                The Kâma-Mânasic spook may become that which is called in
                Occultism the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Dweller on the Threshold.”</span> This
                Dweller is not like that which is described so graphically in
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zanoni</span></span>, but an actual fact in Nature and not a fiction in romance,
                however beautiful the latter may be. Bulwer, however, must have
                got the idea from some Eastern Initiate. This Dweller, led by
                affinity and attraction, forces itself into the astral current,
                and through the Auric Envelope, of the new tabernacle inhabited
                by the Parent Ego, and declares war to the lower light which has
                replaced it. This, of course, can only happen in the case of the
                moral weakness of the personality so obsessed. No one strong in
                virtue, and righteous in his walk of life, can risk or dread any
                such thing; but only those depraved in heart. Robert Louis
                Stevenson had a glimpse of a true vision indeed when he wrote
                his
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</span></span>. His story is a true allegory. Every Chelâ will recognise in
                it a substratum of truth, and in Mr. Hyde a Dweller, an obsessor
                of the personality, the tabernacle of the Parent Spirit.

                or, if it become too strong in evil—<span class="tei tei-q">“immortal in Satan”</span>
                is the Occult expression—it is sometimes allowed, for Karmic

                through and through with the essence of Matter; for evil is

                Thus we find two kinds of soulless beings on earth: those who
                have lost their Higher Ego in the present incarnation, and those
                who are born soulless, having been severed from their Spiritual
                Soul in the preceding birth. The former are candidates for
                Avîtchi; the latter are
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Hydes,”</span> whether
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>
                or
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">out</span></em>
                of human bodies, whether incarnated or hanging about as
                invisible though potent ghouls. In such men, cunning develops to
                an enormous degree, and no one except those who are familiar
                with the doctrine would suspect them of being soulless, for
                neither Religion nor Science has the least suspicion that such
                facts actually exist in Nature.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                There is, however, still hope for a person who has lost his
                Higher Soul through his vices, while he is yet in the body. He
                may be still redeemed and made to turn on his material nature.
                For either an intense feeling of repentance, or one single
                earnest appeal to the Ego that has fled, or best of all, an
                active effort to amend one's ways, may bring the Higher Ego back
                again. The thread of connection is not altogether broken, though
                the Ego is now beyond forcible reach, for
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Antahkarana is destroyed,”</span> and
                the personal Entity has one foot already in Myalba;<a href="#note_850" id="noteref_850" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a>
                yet it is not entirely beyond hearing a strong spiritual appeal.
                There is another statement made in

                on this subject. It is said that this terrible death may be
                sometimes avoided by the knowledge of the mysterious
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Name</span></span>, the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>.”</span><a href="#note_852" id="noteref_852" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a>
                What this
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>,”</span>
                which is not a <span class="tei tei-q">“Word”</span> but a
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sound</span></em>, is, you all know. Its potency lies in the rhythm or the
                accent. This means simply that even a bad person may, by the
                study of the Sacred Science, be redeemed and stopped on the path
                of destruction. But unless he is in thorough union with his
                Higher Ego, he may repeat it, parrot-like, ten thousand times a
                day, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Word”</span> will not help
                him. On the contrary, if not entirely at one with his Higher
                Triad, it may produce quite the reverse of a beneficent effect,
                the Brothers of the Shadow using it very often for malicious
                objects; in which case it awakens and stirs up naught but the
                evil, material elements of Nature. But if one's nature is good,
                and sincerely strives towards the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Higher Self</span></span>, which is that Aum, through one's Higher Ego, which is its
                third <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page528">[pg 528]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg528"></a> letter, and Buddhi
                the second, there is no attack of the Dragon Apophis which it
                will not repel. From those to whom much is given much is
                expected. He who knocks at the door of the Sanctuary in full
                knowledge of its sacredness, and after obtaining admission,
                departs from the threshold, or turns round and says,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Oh, there's nothing in it!”</span> and
                thus loses his chance of learning the whole truth—can but await
                his Karma.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Such are then the Esoteric explanations of that which has
                perplexed so many who have found what they thought
                contradictions in various Theosophical writings, including
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Fragments of Occult Truth,”</span> in
                vols. iii. and iv. of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Theosophist</span></span>, etc. Before finally dismissing the subject, I must add a
                caution, which pray keep well in mind. It will be very natural
                for those of you who are Esotericists to hope that none of you
                belong so far to the soulless portion of mankind, and that you
                can feel quite easy about Avîtchi, even as the good citizen is
                about the penal laws. Though not, perhaps, exactly on the Path
                as yet, you are skirting its border, and many of you in the
                right direction. Between such venal faults as are inevitable
                under our social environment, and the blasting wickedness
                described in the Editor's note on Éliphas Lévi's
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Satan,”</span><a href="#note_853" id="noteref_853" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a>
                there is an abyss. If not become
                <span class="tei tei-q">“immortal in good by identification with (our) God,”</span>
                or
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Aum</span></span>, Âtmâ-Buddhi-Manas, we have surely not made ourselves
                <span class="tei tei-q">“immortal in evil”</span> by coalescing
                with Satan, the lower Self. You forget, however, that everything
                must have a beginning; that the first step on a slippery
                mountain slope is the necessary antecedent to one's falling
                precipitately to the bottom and into the arms of death. Be it
                far from me the suspicion that any of the Esoteric students have
                reached to any considerable point down the plane of spiritual
                descent. All the same I warn you to avoid taking the first step.
                You may not reach the bottom in this life or the next, but you
                may now generate causes which will insure your spiritual
                destruction in your third, fourth, fifth, or even some
                subsequent birth. In the great Indian epic you may read how a
                mother whose whole family of warrior sons were slaughtered in
                battle, complained to Krishna that though she had the spiritual
                vision to enable her to look back fifty incarnations, yet she
                could see no sin of hers that could have begotten so dreadful a
                Karma; and Krishna answered her:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou could'st look back to thy fifty-first anterior
                  birth, as I can, thou would'st see thyself killing in wanton
                  cruelty the same number of
                  <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page529">[pg 529]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg529"></a> ants as that of the
                  sons thou hast now lost.”</span>
                This, of course, is only a poetical exaggeration; yet it is a
                striking image to show how great results come from apparently
                trifling causes.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Good and evil are relative, and are intensified or lessened
                according to the conditions by which man is surrounded. One who
                belongs to that which we call the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“useless portion of mankind,”</span>
                that is to say, the lay majority, is in many cases
                irresponsible. Crimes committed in Avidyâ, or ignorance, involve
                physical but not moral responsibilities or Karma. Take, for
                example, the case of idiots, children, savages, and people who
                know no better. But the case of each who is pledged to the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Higher Self</span></span>
                is quite another matter.
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">You cannot invoke this Divine Witness with impunity</span></em>, and once that you have put yourselves under its tutelage, you
                have asked the Radiant Light to shine and search through all the
                dark corners of your being; consciously you have invoked the
                Divine Justice of Karma to take note of your motive, to
                scrutinize your actions, and to enter up all in your account.
                The step is irrevocable as that of the infant taking birth.
                Never again can you force yourselves back into the matrix of
                Avidyâ and irresponsibility. Though you flee to the uttermost
                parts of the earth, and hide yourselves from the sight of men,
                or seek oblivion in the tumult of the social whirl, that Light
                will find you out and lighten your every thought, word and deed.
                All H. P. B. can do is to send to each earnest one among you a
                most sincerely fraternal sympathy and hope for a good outcome to
                your endeavours. Nevertheless, be not discouraged, but try, ever
                keep trying;<a href="#note_854" id="noteref_854" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a>
                twenty failures are not irremediable if followed by as many
                undaunted struggles upward. Is it not so that mountains are
                climbed? And know further, that if Karma relentlessly records in
                the Esotericist's account, bad deeds that in the ignorant would
                be overlooked, yet, equally true is it that each of his good
                deeds is, by reason of his association with the Higher Self, a
                hundredfold intensified as a potentiality for good.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Finally, keep ever in mind the consciousness that though you see
                no Master by your bedside, nor hear one audible whisper in the
                silence of the still night, yet the Holy Power is about you, the
                Holy Light is shining into your hour of spiritual need and

                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Masters</span></span>, or of their humble mouthpiece and servant, if through
                perversity or moral feebleness some of you cut yourselves off
                from these higher potencies, and step upon the declivity that
                leads to Avîtchi.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Students in the west have little or no idea of the forces that
                lie latent in Sound, the Âkâshic vibrations that may be set up
                by those who understand how to pronounce certain words. The Om,
                or the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Om mani padme hum</span></span>”</span>
                are in spiritual affinity with cosmic forces, but without a
                knowledge of the natural arrangement, or of the order in which
                the syllables stand, very little can be achieved.
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Om”</span> is, of course, Aum, that may
                be pronounced as two, three or seven syllables, setting up
                different vibrations.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Now, letters, as vocal sounds, cannot fail to correspond with
                musical notes, and therefore with numbers and colours; hence
                also with Forces and Tattvas. He who remembers that the Universe
                is built up from the Tattvas will readily understand something
                of the power that may be exercised by vocal sounds. Every letter
                in the alphabet, whether divided into three, four, or seven
                septenaries, or forty-nine letters, has its own colour, or shade
                of colour. He who has learnt the colours of the alphabetical
                letters, and the corresponding numbers of the seven, and the
                forty-nine colours and shades on the scale of planes and forces,
                and knows their respective order in the seven planes, will
                easily master the art of bringing them into affinity or
                interplay. But here a difficulty arises. The Senzar and Sanskrit
                alphabets, and other Occult tongues, besides other potencies,
                have a number, colour, and distinct syllable for every letter,
                and so had also the old Mosaic Hebrew. But how many students
                know any of these tongues? When the time comes, therefore, it
                must suffice to teach the students the numbers and colours
                attached to the Latin letters only (N.B. as pronounced in Latin,
                not in Anglo-Saxon, Scotch, or Irish). This, however, would be
                at present premature.
              </p>
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg531"></a>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The colour and number of not only the planets but also the
                zodiacal constellations corresponding to every letter of the
                alphabet, are necessary to make any special syllable, and even
                letter,

                Therefore if a student would make Buddhi operative, for
                instance, he would have to intone the first words of the Mantra
                on the note
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mi</span></span>. But he would have still further to accentuate the
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mi</span></span>, and produce mentally the yellow colour corresponding to this
                sound and note, on every letter M in
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Om mani padme hum</span></span>”</span>; this, not because the note bears the same name in the
                vernacular, Sanskrit, or even the Senzar, for it does not—but
                because the letter M follows the first letter, and is in this
                sacred formula also the seventh and the fourth. As Buddhi it is
                second; as Buddhi-Manas it is the second and third combined.

                develops the Tetraktys from the Triangle, and so becomes the
                Seven, the Creative Force, making a Decad with the primordial
                Triangle which originated it. When this heavenly Triangle and
                Tetraktys are reflected in the Universe of Matter, as the astral
                paradigmatic man, they are reversed, and the Triangle, or
                formative potency, is thrown below the Quaternary, with its apex
                pointing downwards: the Monad of this astral paradigmatic man is
                itself a Triangle, bearing to the Quaternary and Triangle the
                relation borne by the primordial Triangle to the Heavenly Man.
                Hence the phrase,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the upper Triangle ... is shifted in the man of clay below
                  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the seven</span></em>.”</span>
                Here again the Point tracing the Triangle, the Monad becoming
                the Ternary, with the Quaternary and the lower creative
                triangle, make up the Decad, the perfect number.
                <span class="tei tei-q">“As above, so below.”</span>
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The student will do well to relate the knowledge here acquired
                to that given on p. 477. Here the upper Triangle is given as
                Violet, Indigo, Blue, associating Violet as the paradigm of all
                forms with Indigo as Mahat, and blue as the Âtmic Aura. In the
                Quaternary, Yellow, as substance, is associated with
                Yellow-Orange, Life, and Red-Orange, the creative potency. Green
                is the plane between.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The next stage is not explained. Green passes upwards to Violet,
                Indigo, Blue, the Triangle opening out to receive it, and so
                forming the square, Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green. This leaves the
                Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, and Yellow, and these, having thus
                lost their fourth member, can only form a triangle. This
                triangle revolves, to point downwards for the descent into
                matter, and
                <span class="tei tei-q">“mirrored on the plane of gross nature, it is
                  reversed.”</span>

                In the perfect man the Red will be absorbed by the Green; Yellow
                will become one with Indigo; Yellow-Orange will be absorbed in
                Blue; Violet will remain outside the True Man, though connected
                with him. Or, to translate the colours: Kâma will be absorbed in

                be absorbed in the Auric Egg; the physical body remains,

                To the five senses at present the property of mankind two more
                on this globe are to be added. The sixth sense is the psychic
                sense of colour. The seventh is that of spiritual sound. In the
                second instruction, the corrected rates of vibration for the
                seven primary colours and their modulations are given.
                Inspecting these, it appears that each colour differs from the
                proceeding one by a step of 42, or 6 × 7.

                Black Magic results. This is why all sexual intercourse is

                Taking the question in the sense of an Adept putting something
                into or acting on the Auric Egg of a child, then this could not
                be done, as the Auric Egg is Karmic, and not even an Adept must
                interfere with such Karmic record. If the Adept were to put
                anything into the Auric Egg of another, for which the person is
                not responsible, or which does not come from the Higher Self of
                that personality, how could Karmic justice be maintained?

                The Adept can draw into his own Auric Egg from his planet, or
                even from that of the globe or of the universe, according to his
                degree. This envelope is the receptacle of all Karmic causes,
                and photographs all things like a sensitive plate.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The child has a very small Auric Egg which is in colour almost
                pure white. At birth the Auric Egg consists of almost pure
                Akâsha plus the Tanhâs, which, until the seventh year, remain
                potential or in latency.

                The Auric Egg of an idiot cannot be said to be human, that is,
                it is not tinged with Manas. It is Akâshic vibrations rather
                than an Auric Egg—the material envelope, such as that of the
                plant, the mineral or other object.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The Auric Egg is the transmitter from the periodical lives to

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The reason why the confession of the Roman Catholic and Greek
                Churches is so great a sin is because the confessor interferes
                with the Auric Egg of the penitent by means of his will power,
                engrafting artificially emanations from his own Auric Egg and
                casting seeds for germination into the Auric Egg of his subject.
                It is on the same lines as hypnotic suggestion.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The above remarks apply equally to Hypnotism, although the
                latter is a psycho-physical force, and it is this which
                constitutes one of its many serious dangers. At the same time
                <span class="tei tei-q">“a good thing may pass through dirty channels,”</span>
                as in the case of the breaking by suggestion of the alcohol or
                opium habit. Mesmerism may be used by the Occultist to remove
                evil habits, if the intention be perfectly pure; as on the
                higher plane intention is everything, and good intention must
                work for good.

                It is the Auric Egg. The Auric Egg is quite pure at birth, but
                it is a question whether the higher or lower Manas will colour
                it at the seventh year. The Mânasic expansion is pure Âkâsha.
                The ray of Manas is let down into the vortex of the lower
                Principles, and being discoloured, and so limited by the Kâmic
                Tanhâs and by the defects of the bodily organism, forms the
                personality. Hereditary Karma can reach the child before the
                seventh year, but no individual Karma can come into play till
                the descent of the Manas.

                explaining that the latter was the meaning, H. P. B. said that]
                it was only in the Turîya state, the fourth of the seven steps
                of Râja Yoga that the Yogî can represent to himself that which
                is abstract. Below this state, the perceptive power, being
                conditioned, must have some form to contemplate; it cannot
                represent to itself the Arûpa. In the Turîya state the Triangle
                is in yourself and is felt. Below the Turîya state there must be
                a symbol to represent Âtmâ-Buddhi-Manas. It is not a mere
                geometrical Triangle, but the Triad imaged, to make thought
                possible. Of this Triad, we can make some kind of representation
                of Manas, however indistinct; while of Âtmâ no image can be
                formed. We must try to represent the Triangle to ourselves on
                higher and higher planes. We must figure Manas as overshadowed
                by Buddhi, and immersed in Âtmâ. Only Manas, the Higher Ego, can
                be represented; we may think it as the Augoeides, the radiant

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Psychic vision, however, is not to be desired, since Psyche is
                earthly and evil. More and more as Science advances, the psychic
                will be reached and understood; Psychism has in it nothing that
                is spiritual. Science is right on its own plane, from its own
                standpoint. The law of the Conservation of Energy implies that
                psychic motion is generated by motion. Psychic motion being only
                motion on the Psychic Plane, a material plane, the Psychologist
                is right who sees in it nothing beyond matter. Animals have no
                Spirit, but they have psychic vision, and are sensitive to
                psychic conditions; observe how these react on their health,
                their bodily state.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Motion is the abstract Deity; on the highest plane it is Arûpa,
                absolute; but on the lowest it is merely mechanical. Psychic
                action is within the sphere of physical motion. Ere psychic
                action can be developed in the brain and nerves, there must be
                adequate action which generates it on the Physical Plane. The
                paralyzed animal that cannot generate action in the physical
                body, cannot think. Psychics merely see on a plane of different
                material density; the spiritual glimpses sometimes obtained by
                them come from a plane beyond. A Psychic's vision is that of one
                coming, as it were, into a lighted room, and seeing everything
                there by an artificial light: when the light is extinguished,
                vision is lost. Spiritual vision sees by the light within,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page543">[pg 543]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg543"></a> the light hidden
                beneath the bushel of the body, by which we can see clearly and
                independently of all outside. The Psychic seeing by an external
                light, the vision is coloured by the nature of that light.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                X. saying that she felt as though she saw on three planes, H. P.
                B. answered that each plane was sevenfold, the Astral as every
                other. She gave as an example on the Physical Plane the vision
                of a table with the sense of sight; seeing it still, with the
                eyes closed, by retinal impression; the image of it conserved in
                the brain; it can be recalled by memory; it can be seen in
                dream; or as an aggregate of atoms; or as disintegrated. All
                these are on the Physical Plane. Then we can begin again on the
                Astral Plane, and obtain another septenary. This hint should be
                followed and worked out.

                It is wrong to speak of the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“lower Quaternary”</span> in the
                Macrocosm. It is the Tetraktys, the highest, the most sacred of
                all symbols. There comes a moment when, in the highest
                meditation, the Lower Manas is withdrawn into the Triad, which
                thus becomes the Quaternary, the Tetraktys of Pythagoras,
                leaving what was the Quaternary as the lower Triad, which is
                then reversed. The Triad is reflected in the Lower Manas. The
                Higher Manas cannot reflect itself, but when the Green passes
                upward it becomes a mirror for the Higher; it is then no more
                Green, having passed from its associations. The Psyche then
                becomes spiritual, the Ternary is reflected in the Fourth, and
                the Tetraktys is formed. So long as you are not dead, there must
                be something to reflect the Higher Triad; for there must be
                something to bring back to the waking consciousness the
                experiences passed through on the higher plane. The Lower Manas
                is as a tablet which retains the impressions made on it during
                trance.

                there will be two spinal cords. In the Seventh Race the two will
                merge into the one. The evolution corresponds to the Races, and
                with the evolution of the Races the sympathetic developes into a
                true spinal cord. We are returning up the arc only with
                self-consciousness added. The Sixth Race will correspond to the
                <span class="tei tei-q">“pudding bags,”</span> but will have the
                perfection of form with the highest intelligence and

                Anatomists are beginning to find new ramifications and new
                modifications in the human body. They are in error on many

                have a name for each. They call them by the names of the Gods,
                as Brahmâ's Hall, Vishnu's Hall, etc. They correspond with parts
                of the brain. The very atoms of the body are the thirty-three

                No; the umbilical cord joining the astral to the physical body
                is a real thing. Antahkarana is imaginary, a figure of speech,
                and is only the bridging over from the Higher to the Lower
                Manas. Antahkarana only exists when you commence to
                <span class="tei tei-q">“throw your thought upwards and downwards.”</span>
                The Mâyâvi Rûpa, or Mânasic body, has no material connection
                with the physical body, no umbilical cord. It is spiritual and
                ethereal, and passes everywhere without let or hindrance. It
                entirely differs from the astral body, which, if injured, acts
                by repercussion on the physical body. The Devachanic entity,
                even previous to birth, can be affected by the Skandhas, but
                these have nothing to do with the Antahkarana. It is affected,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, by the desire for reincarnation.

                The pineal gland corresponds with Divine Thought. The pituitary
                body is the organ of the Psychic Plane. Psychic vision is caused
                by the molecular motion of this body, which is directly
                connected with the optic nerve, and thus affects the sight and
                gives rise to hallucinations. Its motion may readily cause
                flashes of light, such as may be obtained by pressing the
                eyeballs. Drunkenness and fever produce illusions of sight and
                hearing by the action of the pituitary body. This body is
                sometimes so affected by drunkenness that it is paralyzed. If an
                influence on the optic nerve is thus produced and the current
                thus reversed, the colour will probably be complementary.

                It is. The body is not a Principle in Esoteric parlance, because
                the body and the Linga are both on the same plane; then the
                Auric Egg makes the seventh. The body is an Upâdhi rather than a

                to each other as the body and its Linga, the earth being the

                next plane. The highest of one plane touches the lowest of the
                next. Seven is a factor in nature, as in colours and sounds.
                There are seven degrees in the same piece of wood, each

                The physical plane is one of them. You cannot see Âkâsha, but
                you can sense it from the Fourth Path. You may not be fully
                conscious of it, and yet you may sense it. Âkâsha is at the root
                of the manifestation of all sounds. Sound is the expression and
                manifestation of that which is behind it, and which is the
                parent of many correlations. All Nature is a sounding-board; or
                rather Âkâsha is the sounding-board of Nature. It is the Deity,
                the one Life, the one Existence. (Hearing is the vibration of
                molecular particles; the order is seen in the sentence,

                Sound can have no end. H. P. B. remarked with regard to a tap
                made by a pencil on the table:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“By this time it has affected the whole universe. The
                  particle which has had its wear and tear destroys something

                  something else. It is eternal in the Nidânas it
                  produces.”</span>
                A sound, if not previously produced on the Astral Plane, and
                before that on the Âkâshic, could not be produced at all. Âkâsha
                is the bridge between nerve cells and mental powers.

                This phrase was not to be taken out of its context, otherwise
                confusion would arise. All are on all planes. The First Race had
                touch all over like a sounding board; this touch differentiated
                into the other senses, which developed with the Races. The
                <span class="tei tei-q">“sense”</span> of the First Race was
                that of touch, meaning the power of their atoms to vibrate in
                unison with external atoms. The
                <span class="tei tei-q">“touch”</span> would be almost the same

                The instinctual consciousness of animals and idiots in its
                lowest degrees, the planes of sensation: in man these are
                rationalized,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, a dog shut in a room has the instinct to get out, but cannot
                because its instinct is not sufficiently rationalized to take
                the necessary means; whereas a man at once takes in the
                situation and extricates himself. The highest degree of this
                Kâma-Mânasic consciousness is the psychic. Thus there are seven
                degrees from the instinctual animal to the rationalized
                instinctual and psychic.

                retreated from us, and shrunk much in size. (The moon gave all
                her Principles to the earth, while the Pitris gave only their
                Chhâyâs to man.)

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The influences of the moon are wholly psycho-physiological. It
                is dead, sending out injurious emanations like a corpse. It
                vampirizes the earth and its inhabitants, so that anyone
                sleeping in its rays suffers, losing some of his life-force. A
                white cloth is a protection, the rays not passing through it,
                and the head especially should be thus guarded. It has most
                power when it is full. It throws off particles which we absorb,
                and is gradually disintegrating. Where there is snow the moon
                looks like a corpse, being unable, through the white snow, to
                vampirize effectually. Hence snow-covered mountains are free
                from its bad influences. The moon is phosphorescent.

                of the sun on humanity is connected with Kâma-Prâna, with the

                consciously by the personal man. The three higher states cannot
                be reached and remembered by the latter, unless he is a fully

                the seventh portal, the Satyaloka. For such, the Master Yogîs
                tell us, is the fruition of Yajna, or sacrifice. When the Bhûr,
                Bhuvar and Svarga (states) are once passed, and the Yogî's
                consciousness centred in Maharloka, it is in the last plane and

                These fourteen Lokas, or spheres, form the extent of the whole

                Bhûrloka is the waking state in which we normally live; it is
                the state in which animals also are, when they sense food, a
                danger, etc. To be in Svarloka is to be completely abstracted on
                this plane, leaving only instinct to work, so that on the
                material plane you would behave as an animal. Yogîs are known
                who have become crystallized in this state, and then they must
                be nourished by others. A Yogî near Allahabad had been for
                fifty-three years sitting on a stone; his Chelâs plunge him into
                the river every night and then replace him. During the day his
                consciousness returns to Bhûrloka, and he talks and teaches. A
                Yogî was found on an island near Calcutta round whose limbs the
                roots of trees had grown. He was cut out, and in the endeavour
                to awaken him so many outrages were inflicted on him that he
                died.

                The consciousness cannot be entirely on two planes at once. The
                higher and lower states are not wholly incompatible, but if you
                are on the higher you will wool-gather on the lower. In order to
                remember the higher state on returning to the lower, the memory
                must be carried upwards to the higher. An Adept may apparently
                enjoy a dual consciousness; when he desires not to see he can
                abstract himself: he may be in a higher state and yet return
                answers to questions
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page572">[pg 572]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg572"></a> addressed to him. But
                in this case he will momentarily return to the material plane,
                shooting up again to the higher plane. This is his only
                salvation in adverse conditions.

                The lower you go in the Talas the more intellectual you become

                spiritual. Intellect may remain very closely related to Kâma. A
                man may be in a Loka and visit one and all the Talas, his
                condition depending on the Loka to which he belongs. Thus a man
                in Bhûrloka only may pass into the Talas and go to the devil. If
                he dwells in Bhuvarloka he cannot become as bad. If he has
                reached the Satya state he can go into any Tala without danger;
                buoyed up by his own purity he can never be engulfed. The Talas

              </h3>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                H. P. B. began by challenging the views of consciousness in the
                West, commenting on the lack of definition in the leading
                Philosophies. No distinction was made between consciousness and
                self-consciousness, and yet in this lay the difference between
                man and the animal. The animal was conscious only, not
                self-conscious; the animal does not know the Ego as Subject, as
                does man. There is therefore an enormous difference between the
                consciousness of the bird, the insect, the beast, and that of
                man.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                But the full consciousness of man is self-consciousness—that
                which makes us say,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I</span></em>
                  do that.”</span>
                If there is pleasure it must be traced to some one experiencing
                it. Now the difference between the consciousness of man and of
                animals is that while there is a Self in the animal, the animal
                is not conscious of the Self. Spencer reasons on consciousness,
                but when he comes to a gap he merely jumps over it. So again
                Hume, when he says that on introspection he sees merely feelings
                and can never find any
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I,”</span> forgets that without an
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I”</span> no seeing of feelings would
                be possible. What is it that studies the feelings? The animal is
                not conscious of the feeling
                <span class="tei tei-q">“I am I.”</span> It has instinct, but
                instinct is not self-consciousness. Self-consciousness is an
                attribute of the mind, not of the soul, the
                <span class="tei tei-foreign" lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">anima</span></span>, whence the very name
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></em>
                is taken. Humanity had no self-consciousness until the coming of
                the Mânasaputras in the Third Race. Consciousness,
                brain-consciousness, is the field of the light of the Ego, of
                the Auric Egg, of the Higher Manas. The cells of the leg are
                conscious, but they are the slaves of the idea; they are not
                self-conscious, they cannot originate an idea, although when
                they are tired they can convey to the brain an uneasy sensation,
                and so give rise to the idea of fatigue. Instinct is the lower
                state of consciousness. Man has consciousness running through
                the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page574">[pg 574]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg574"></a> four lower keys of
                his septenary consciousness; there are seven scales of
                consciousness in his consciousness, which is none the less
                essentially and pre-eminently one, a unit. There are millions
                and millions of states of consciousness, as there are millions
                and millions of leaves; but as you cannot find two leaves alike,
                so you cannot find two states of consciousness alike; a state is
                never exactly repeated.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Is memory a thing born in us that it can give birth to the Ego?
                Knowledge, feeling, volition, are colleagues of the mind, not
                faculties of it. Memory is an artificial thing, an adjunct of
                relativeness; it can be sharpened or left dull, and it depends
                on the condition of the brain-cells which store all impressions;
                knowledge, feeling, volition, cannot be correlated, do what you
                will. They are not produced from each other, nor produced from
                mind, but are principles, colleagues. You cannot have knowledge
                without memory, for memory stores all things, garnishing and
                furnishing. If you teach a child nothing, it will know nothing.
                Brain-consciousness depends on the intensity of the light shed
                by the Higher Manas on the Lower, and the extent of affinity
                between the brain and this light. Brain-mind is conditioned by
                the responsiveness of the brain to this light; it is the field
                of consciousness of the Manas. The animal has the Monad and the
                Manas latent, but its brain cannot respond. All potentialities
                are there, but are dormant. There are certain accepted errors in
                the West which vitiate all their theories.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                How many impressions can a man receive simultaneously into his
                consciousness and record? The Westerns say one: Occultists say
                normally seven, and abnormally fourteen, seventeen, nineteen,
                twenty-one, up to forty-nine, impressions can be simultaneously
                received. Occultism teaches that the consciousness always
                receives a sevenfold impression and stores it in the memory. You
                can prove it by striking at once the seven notes of the musical
                scale: the seven sounds reach the consciousness simultaneously,
                but the untrained ear can only recognize them one after another,
                and if you choose you can measure the intervals. The trained ear
                will hear the seven notes at once, simultaneously. And
                experiment has shown that in two or three weeks a man may be
                trained to receive seventeen or eighteen impressions of colour,
                the intervals decreasing with practice.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Memory is acquired for this life, and can be expanded. Genius is
                the greatest responsiveness of the brain and brain-memory to the
                Higher Manas. Impressions on any sense are stored in the memory.
              </p>
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page575">[pg 575]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg575"></a>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Before a physical sense is developed there is a mental feeling
                which proceeds to become a physical sense. Fishes who are blind,
                living in the deep sea, or subterranean waters, if they are put
                into a pond will in a few generations develop eyes. But in their
                previous state there is a sense of seeing, though no physical
                sight; how else should they in the darkness find their way,
                avoid dangers, etc.? The mind will take in and store all kinds
                of things mechanically and unconsciously, and will throw them
                into the memory as unconscious perceptions. If the attention is
                greatly engrossed in any way, the sense perception of any injury
                is not felt at the time, but later the suffering enters into
                consciousness. So, returning to our example of the seven notes
                struck simultaneously, we have one impression, but the ear is
                affected in succession by the notes one after another, so that
                they are stored in the brain-mind in order, for the untrained
                consciousness cannot register them simultaneously. All depends
                on training and on attention. Thus the transference of a
                sensation passing from any organ to the consciousness is almost
                simultaneous if your attention is fixed on it, but if any noise
                distracts your attention, then it will take a fraction more of a
                second before it reaches your consciousness. The Occultist
                should train himself to receive and transmit along the line of
                the seven scales of his consciousness every impression, or
                impressions, simultaneously. He who reduces the intervals of
                physical time the most has made the most progress.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                One of the best proofs that there is an Ego, a true Field of
                Consciousness, is the fact already mentioned, that a state of
                consciousness is never exactly reproduced, though you should
                live a hundred years, and pass through milliards and milliards.
                In an active day, how many states and substates there are; it
                would be impossible to have cells enough for all. This will help
                you to understand why some mental states and abstract things
                follow the Ego into Devachan, and why others merely scatter in
                space. That which touches the Entity has an affinity for it, as
                a noble action, is immortal and goes with it into Devachan,
                forming part and parcel of the biography of the personality
                which is disintegrating. A lofty emotion runs through the seven
                stages, and touches the Ego, the mind that plays its tunes in
                the mind-cells. We can analyze the work of consciousness and
                describe it; but we cannot define consciousness unless we
                postulate a Subject.

                The special physical organ of perception is the brain, and
                perception is located in the aura of the pineal gland. This aura

                sensed, not perceived, in the living man. During the process of
                thought manifesting in consciousness, a constant vibration
                occurs in the light of this aura, and a clairvoyant looking at

                which causes the wear and tear of the organ, by the vibrations
                it sets up. The brain, set vibrating, conveys the vibrations to
                the spinal cord, and so to the rest of the body. Happiness as
                well as sorrow sets up these strong vibrations, and so wears out
                the body. Powerful vibrations of joy or sorrow may thus kill.

                The field of the consciousness of the Higher Ego is never
                reflected in the Astral Light. The Auric Envelope receives the
                impressions of both the Higher and the Lower Manas, and it is
                the latter impressions that are also reflected in the Astral
                Light. Whereas the essence of all things spiritual, all that
                which reaches, or is not rejected by, the Higher Ego is not
                reflected in the Astral Light, because it is on too low a plane.
                But during the life of a man, this essence, with a view to
                Karmic ends, is impressed on the Auric Envelope, and after death
                and the separation of the Principles is united with the
                Universal Mind (that is to say, those
                <span class="tei tei-q">“impressions”</span> which are superior
                to even the Devachanic Plane), to await there Karmically until
                the day when the Ego is to be reincarnated. [There are thus
                three sets of impressions, which we may call the Kâmic,
                Devachanic and Mânasic.] For the entities,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page579">[pg 579]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg579"></a> no matter how high,
                must have their Karmic rewards and punishments on earth. These
                spiritual impressions are made more or less on the brain,
                otherwise the Lower Ego would not be responsible. There are some
                impressions, however, received through the brain, which are not
                of our previous experience. In the case of the Adept the brain
                is trained to retain these impressions.

                The Reincarnating Ray may, for convenience, be separated into
                two aspects: the lower Kâmic Ego is scattered in Kâma Loka; the
                Mânasic part accomplishes its cycle and returns to the Higher
                Ego. It is, in reality, this Higher Ego which is, so to speak,
                punished, which suffers. This is the true crucifixion of the
                Christos—the most abstruse but yet the most important mystery of
                Occultism; all the cycle of our lives hangs on it. It is indeed
                the Higher Ego that is the sufferer; for remember that the
                abstract consciousness of the higher personal consciousness will
                remain impressed on the Ego, since it must be part and parcel of
                its eternity. All our grandest impressions are impressed on the
                Higher Ego, because they are of the same nature as itself.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Patriotism and great actions in national service are not
                altogether good, from the point of view of the highest. To
                benefit a portion of humanity is good; but to do so at the
                expense of the rest is bad. Therefore, in patriotism, etc., the
                venom is present with the good. For though the inner essence of
                the Higher Ego is unsoilable, the outer garment may be soiled.
                Thus both the bad and the good of such thoughts and actions are
                impressed on the Auric Envelope and the Karma of the bad is
                taken up by the Higher Ego, though it is perfectly guiltless of
                it. Thus both sets of impressions, after death, scatter in the
                Universal Mind, and at reincarnation the Ego sends out a Ray
                which is itself, into a new personality, and there suffers. It
                suffers in the Self-consciousness that it has created by its own
                accumulated experiences.

                present cycle. The Ego starts with Divine Consciousness; no
                past, no future, no separation. It is long before realizing that
                it is itself. Only after many births does it begin to discern,
                by this collectivity of experience, that it is individual. At
                the end of its cycle of reincarnation it is still the same
                Divine Consciousness, but it has now become individualized
                Self-consciousness.

                The feeling of responsibility is inspired by the presence of the

                becomes more and more individualized, it learns more and more by
                suffering to recognize its own responsibility, by which it
                finally gains Self-consciousness, the consciousness of all the
                Egos of the whole Universe. Absolute Being, to have the idea or

                The Higher Ego is, as it were, a globe of pure divine light, a

                Descending to a plane of differentiation it emanates a Ray,
                which it can only manifest through the personality which is
                already differentiated. A portion of this Ray, the Lower Manas,
                during life, may so crystallize itself and become one with Kâma
                that it will remain assimilated with Matter. That portion which
                retains its purity forms Antahkarana. The whole fate of an
                incarnation depends on whether Antahkarana will be able to
                restrain the Kâma-Manas or not. After death the higher light
                (Antahkarana) which bears the impressions and memory of all good
                and noble aspirations, assimilates itself with the Higher Ego,
                the bad is dissociated in space, and comes back as bad Karma

                The fires are always playing round the pineal gland, but when
                Kundalinî illuminates them for a brief instant the whole
                universe is seen. Even in deep sleep the Third Eye opens. This

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                In answer to a question on the seven stages of perception, H. P.
                B. said that thought should be centred on the highest, the
                seventh, and then an attempt to transcend this will prove that
                it is impossible to go beyond it on this plane. There is nothing
                in the brain to carry the thinker on, and if thought is to rise
                yet further it must be thought without a brain. Let the eyes be
                closed, the will set not to let the brain work, and then the
                point may be transcended and the student will pass to the next
                plane. All the seven stages of perception come before
                Antahkarana; if you can pass beyond them you are on the Mânasic
                Plane.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Try to imagine something which transcends your power of thought,
                say, the nature of the Dhyân Chohans. Then make the brain
                passive, and pass beyond; you will see a white radiant light,
                like silver, but opalescent as mother of pearl; then waves of
                colour will pass over it, beginning in the tenderest violet, and
                through bronze shades of green to indigo with metallic lustre,
                and that colour will remain. If you see this you are on another
                plane. You should pass through seven stages.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                When a colour comes, glance at it, and if it is not good reject
                it. Let your attention be arrested only on the green, indigo and
                yellow. These are good colours. The eyes being connected with
                the brain, the colour you see most easily will be the colour of
                the personality. If you see red, it is merely physiological, and
                is to be disregarded. Green-bronze is the Lower Manas,
                yellow-bronze the Antahkarana,
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page582">[pg 582]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg582"></a> indigo-bronze is
                Manas. These are to be observed, and when the yellow-bronze
                merges into the indigo you are on the Mânasic Plane.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                On the Mânasic Plane you see the Noumena, the essence of
                phenomena. You do not see people or other consciousnesses, but
                have enough to do to keep your own. The trained Seer can see
                Noumena always. The Adept sees the Noumena on this plane, the
                reality of things, so cannot be deceived.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                In meditation the beginner may waver backwards and forwards
                between two planes. You hear the ticking of a clock on this
                plane, then on the astral—the soul of the ticking. When clocks
                are stopped here the ticking goes on on higher planes, in the
                astral, and then in the ether, until the last bit of the clock
                is gone. It is the same as with a dead body, which sends out
                emanations until the last molecule is disintegrated.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                There is no time in meditation, because there is no succession
                of states of consciousness on this plane.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Violet is the colour of the Astral. You begin with it, but
                should not stay in it; try to pass on. When you see a sheet of
                violet, you are beginning unconsciously to form a Mâyâvi Rûpa.
                Fix your attention, and if you go away keep your consciousness
                firmly to the Mâyâvic Body; do not lose sight of it, hold on
                like grim death.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The consciousness which is merely the animal consciousness is
                made up of the consciousness of all the cells in the body except
                those of the heart. The heart is the king, the most important
                organ in the body of man. Even if the head be severed from the
                body, the heart will continue to beat for thirty minutes. It
                will beat for some hours if wrapped in cotton wool and put in a
                warm place. The spot in the heart which is the last of all to
                die is the seat of life, the centre of all, Brahmâ, the first
                spot that lives in the fœtus and the last that dies. When a Yogî
                is buried in a trance it is this spot that lives, though the
                rest of the body be dead, and as long as this is alive the Yogî
                can be resurrected. This spot contains potentially mind, life,
                energy, and will. During life it radiates prismatic colours,
                fiery and opalescent. The heart is the centre of spiritual
                consciousness, as the brain is the centre of intellectual. But
                this consciousness cannot be guided by a person, nor its energy
                directed by him until he is at one with Buddhi-Manas; until then
                it guides him—if it can. Hence the pangs of
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page583">[pg 583]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg583"></a> remorse, the
                prickings of conscience; they come from the heart, not the head.
                In the heart is the only manifested God, the other two are
                invisible, and it is this which represents the Triad,
                Âtmâ-Buddhi-Manas.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                In reply to a question whether the consciousness might not be
                concentrated in the heart, and so the promptings of the Spirit
                caught, H. P. B. said that any one who could thus concentrate
                would be at one with Manas, would have united Kâma-Manas to the
                Higher Manas. The Higher Manas could not directly guide man, it
                could only act through the Lower Manas.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                There are three principal centres in man, Heart, Head, and
                Navel: any two of which may be + or - to each other, according
                to the relative predominance of the centres.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                The heart represents the Higher Triad; the liver and spleen
                represent the Quaternary. The solar plexus is the brain of the
                stomach.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                H. P. B. was asked if the three centres above-named would
                represent the Christos, crucified between two thieves; she said
                it might serve as an analogy, but these figures must not be
                over-driven. It must never be forgotten that the Lower Manas is
                the same in its essence as the Higher, and may become one with
                it by rejecting Kâmic impulses. The crucifixion of the Christos
                represents the self-sacrifice of the Higher Manas, the Father
                that sends his only begotten Son into the world to take upon him
                our sins: the Christ-myth came from the Mysteries. So also did
                the life of Apollonius of Tyana; this was suppressed by the
                Fathers of the Church because of its striking similarity to the
                life of Christ.

                The psycho-intellectual man is all in the head with its seven

                There are seven cavities in the brain which are quite empty
                during life, and it is in these that visions must be reflected
                if they are to remain in the memory. These centres are, in
                Occultism, called the seven harmonies, the scale of the divine
                harmonies. They are filled with Âkâsha, each with its own
                colour, according to the state of consciousness in which you
                are. The sixth is the pineal gland, which is hollow and empty
                during life; the seventh is the whole; the fifth is the third
                ventricle; the fourth the pituitary body. When Manas is united
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page584">[pg 584]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg584"></a> to Âtmâ-Buddhi, or
                when Âtmâ-Buddhi is centred in Manas, it acts in the three
                higher cavities, radiating, sending forth a halo of light, and
                this is visible in the case of a very holy person.

                The cerebellum is the centre, the storehouse, of all the forces;
                it is the Kâma of the head. The pineal gland corresponds to the
                uterus; its peduncles to the Fallopian tubes. The pituitary body
                is only its servant, its torch-bearer, like the servants bearing
                lights that used to run before the carriage of a princess. Man
                is thus androgyne so far as his head is concerned.

                Universe. There is nothing in the Macrocosm that is not in the
                Microcosm. The pineal gland, as was said, is quite empty during
                life; the pituitary contains various essences. The granules in
                the pineal gland are precipitated after death within the cavity.

                The cerebellum furnishes the materials for ideation; the frontal
                lobes of the cerebrum are the finishers and polishers of the
                materials, but they cannot create of themselves.

                Clairvoyant perception is the consciousness of touch: thus
                reading letters, psychometrizing substances, etc., may be done
                at the pit of the stomach. Every sense has its consciousness,
                and you can have consciousness through every sense. There may be
                consciousness on the plane of sight, though the brain be
                paralyzed; the eyes of a paralyzed person will show terror. So
                with the sense of hearing. Those who are physically blind, deaf

                Skandhas are the germs of life on all the seven planes of Being,
                and make up the totality of the subjective and objective man.
                Every vibration we have made is a Skandha. The Skandhas are
                closely united to the pictures in the Astral Light, which is the
                medium of impressions, and the Skandhas, or vibrations,
                connected with subjective or objective man, are the links which
                attract the Reincarnating Ego, the germs left behind when it
                went into Devachan which have to be picked up again and
                exhausted by a new personality. The exoteric Skandhas have to do
                with the physical atoms and vibrations, or objective man; the
                Esoteric with the internal and subjective man.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                A mental change, or a glimpse of spiritual truth, may make a man
                suddenly change to the truth even at his death, thus creating
                good Skandhas for the next life. The last acts or thoughts of a
                man have an enormous effect upon his future life, but he would
                still have to suffer for his misdeeds, and this is the basis of
                the idea of a death-bed repentance. But the Karmic effects of
                the past life must follow, for the man in his next birth must
                pick up the Skandhas or vibratory impressions that he left in
                the Astral Light, since nothing comes from nothing in Occultism,
                and there must be a link between the lives. New Skandhas are
                born from their old parents.

                It is wrong to speak of Tanhâs in the plural; there is only one
                Tanhâ,
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the desire to live</span></em>. This develops into a multitude or one might say a congeries
                of ideas. The Skandhas are Karmic and non-Karmic. Skandhas may
                produce Elementals by unconscious Kriyâshakti. Every Elemental
                that is thrown out by man must return to him sooner or later,
                since it is his own vibration. They thus become his
                Frankenstein. Elementals are simply effects producing effects.
                They are disembodied thoughts, good and bad. They remain
                crystallized in the Astral Light and are attracted by affinity
                and galvanized back into life again, when their originator
                returns to earth-life. You can paralyze them by reverse effects.
                Elementals are caught like a disease and hence are dangerous to
                ourselves and to others. This is why it is dangerous to
                influence others. The Elementals which live after your death are
                those which you implant in others: the rest remain latent till
                you are reincarnated, when they come to life in you.
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus,”</span> H. P. B. said,

                  instance, will have to suffer for all the wrong teaching he

                The Linga Sharîra in the spleen is the perfect picture of the

                Body is the subjective image of the man which is to be, the

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Fire is not an Element but a divine thing. The physical flame is
                the objective vehicle of the highest Spirit. The Fire Elementals
                are the highest. Everything in this world has its Aura and its
                Spirit. The flame you apply to the candle has nothing to do with
                the candle itself. The Aura of the object comes into conjunction
                with the lowest part of the other. Granite cannot burn because
                its Aura is Fire. Fire Elementals have no consciousness on this
                plane, they are too high, reflecting the divinity of their own
                source. Other Elementals have consciousness on this plane as
                they reflect man and his nature. There is a very great
                difference between the mineral and vegetable kingdoms. The wick
                of the lamp, for instance, is negative. It is made positive by
                fire, the oil being the medium. Æther is Fire. The lowest part
                of Æther is the flame which you see. Fire is Divinity in its
                subjective presence throughout the universe. Under other
                conditions, this Universal Fire manifests as water, air and
                earth. It is the one Element in our visible Universe which is
                the Kriyâshakti of all forms of life. It is that which gives
                light, heat, death, life, etc. It is even the blood. In all its
                various manifestations it is essentially
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>.

                Evidence of the esteem in which Fire was held are to be found in

                Moses—all Fire. Fire is like a looking-glass in its nature, and
                reflects the beams of the first order of subjective
                manifestations which are supposed to be thrown on to the screen
                of the first outlines of the created universe; in their lower
                aspect these are the creations of Fire.

                Fire in the grossest aspect of its essence is the first form and
                reflects the lower forms of the first subjective beings which
                are in the universe. The first divine chaotic thoughts are the
                Fire Elementals. When on earth they take form and come flitting
                in the flame in the form of the Salamanders or lower Fire
                Elementals. In the air you have millions of living and conscious
                beings, besides our thoughts which they catch up. The Fire
                Elementals are related to the sense of sight and absorb the
                Elementals of all the other senses. Thus through sight you can
                have the consciousness of feeling, hearing, tasting, etc., since
                all are included in the sense of sight.

                upward and downward. The upward tendencies become its Devachanic
                experiences; the lower are Kâmic. The Higher Manas stands to
                Buddhi as the Lower Manas to the Higher.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                As to the question of responsibility, it may be understood by an
                example. If you take the form of Jack the Ripper, you must
                suffer for its misdeeds, for the law will punish the murderer
                and hold him responsible. You are the sacrificial victim. In the
                same way the Higher Ego is the Christos, the sacrificial victim
                for the Lower Manas. The Ego takes the responsibility of every
                body it informs.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                You borrow some money to lend it to another; the other runs
                away, but it is you who are responsible. The mission of the
                Higher Ego is to shoot out a Ray to be a Soul in a child.

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                Thus the Ego incarnates in a thousand bodies, taking upon itself
                the sins and responsibilities of each body. At every incarnation
                a new Ray is emitted, and yet it is the same Ray in essence, the
                same in you and me and every one. The dross of the incarnation
                disintegrates, the good goes to Devachan.

                The Flame is eternal. From the Flame of the Higher Ego, the
                Lower is lighted, and from this a lower vehicle, and so on.
              </p>
              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1em">
                And yet the Lower Manas is such as it makes itself. It is
                possible for it to act differently in like conditions, for it
                has reason and self-conscious knowledge of right and wrong, and
                good and evil, given to it. It is in fact endowed with all the
                attributes of the Divine Soul. In this the Ray is the Higher
                Manas, the speck of responsibility on earth.

                The part of the essence is the essence, but while it is out of
                itself, so to say, it can get soiled and polluted. The Ray can
                be manifested on this earth because it can send forth its Mâyâvi
                Rûpa. But the Higher cannot, so it has to send forth a Ray. We
                may look upon the Higher Ego as the Sun, and the personal
                Manases as its Rays. If we take away the surrounding air and
                light the Ray may be said to return to the Sun, so with the
                Lower Manas and Lower Quaternary.

                In cases of sudden death, the Lower Manas no more disappears
                than does the Kâma Rûpa after death. After the severance the Ray
                may be said to snap or be dropped. After death such a man cannot
                go to Devachan, nor yet remain in Kâma Loka; his fate is to
                reincarnate immediately. Such an entity is then an animal Soul

              Nowhere are the Neoplatonists guilty of such an absurdity. The

              of the founder of Neoplatonism. He belonged to the School of
              Aristobulus the Jew, who lived under Ptolemy Philometer (150 years

              It is well-known that, though born of Christian parents, Ammonius
              had renounced the tenets of the Church—Eusebius and Jerome
              notwithstanding. Porphyry, the disciple of Plotinus, who had lived
              with Ammonius for eleven years together, and who had no interest
              for stating an untruth, positively declares that he had renounced
              Christianity entirely. On the other hand, we know that Ammonius
              believed in the bright Gods, Protectors, and that the Neoplatonic
              Philosophy was as <span class="tei tei-q">“pagan”</span> as it was
              mystical. But Eusebius, the most unscrupulous forger and falsifier
              of old texts, and St. Jerome, an out-and-out fanatic, who had both
              an interest in denying the fact, contradict Porphyry. We prefer to
              believe the latter, who has left to posterity an unblemished name
              and a great reputation for honesty.

              Two works are falsely attributed to Ammonius. One, now lost,
              called
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Consensu Moysis et Jesu</span></span>, is mentioned by the same
              <span class="tei tei-q">“trustworthy”</span> Eusebius, the Bishop
              of Cæsaræa, and the friend of the Christian Emperor Constantine,
              who died, however, a heathen. All that is known of this
              pseudo-work is that Jerome bestows great praise upon it (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vir. Illust.</span></span>, § 55; and Euseb.,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">H. E.</span></span>, vi. 19). The other spurious production is called the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diatesseron</span></span>
              (or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Harmony of the Gospels”</span>).
              This is partially extant. But then, again, it exists only in the
              Latin version of Victor, Bishop of Capua (sixth century), who
              attributed it himself to Tatian, and as wrongly, probably, as
              later scholars attributed the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diatesseron</span></span>
              to Ammonius. Therefore no great reliance can be placed upon it,
              nor on its
              <span class="tei tei-q">“esoteric”</span> interpretation of the
              Gospels. Is it this work, we wonder, which led Prof. Jowett to
              regard the Neo-platonic interpretations as
              <span class="tei tei-q">“absurdities”</span>?

              We think we see the sidereal phantom of the old Philosopher and
              Mystic—once of Cambridge University—Henry More, moving about in
              the astral mist over the old moss-covered roofs of the ancient
              town in which he wrote his famous letter to Glanvil about
              <span class="tei tei-q">“witches.”</span> The

              The forty-two Sacred Books of the Egyptians, mentioned by Clement
              of Alexandria as having existed in his time, were but a portion of
              the Books of Hermes. Iamblichus, on the authority of the Egyptian
              priest Abammon, attributes 1,200 of such books to Hermes, and
              Manetho 36,000. But the testimony of Iamblichus as a Neoplatonist
              and Theurgist is of course rejected by modern critics. Manetho,
              who is held by Bunsen in the highest consideration as a
              <span class="tei tei-q">“purely historical personage,”</span> with
              whom
              <span class="tei tei-q">“none of the later native historians can be compared”</span>
              (see
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Égypte</span></span>, i. 97), suddenly becomes a Pseudo-Manetho, as soon as the ideas
              propounded by him clash with the scientific prejudices against
              Magic and the Occult knowledge claimed by the ancient priests.
              However, none of the Archæologists doubt for a moment the almost
              incredible antiquity of the Hermetic books. Champollion shows the
              greatest regard for their authenticity and truthfulness,
              corroborated as it is by many of the oldest monuments. And Bunsen
              brings irrefutable proofs of their age. From his researches, for
              instance, we learn that there was a line of sixty-one kings before
              the days of Moses, who preceded the Mosaic period by a
              clearly-traceable civilization of several thousand years. Thus we
              are warranted in believing that the works of Hermes Trismegistus
              were extant many ages before the birth of the Jewish law-giver.
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Styli and inkstands were found on monuments of the fourth
                Dynasty, the oldest in the world,”</span>
              says Bunsen. If the eminent Egyptologist rejects the period of
              48,863 years before Alexander, to which Diogenes Laërtius carries
              back the records of the priests, he is evidently more embarrassed
              with the ten thousand of astronomical observations, and remarks
              that
              <span class="tei tei-q">“if they were actual observations, they
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must have</span></em>

              History is full of proofs of the same. Had not Anaxagoras
              enunciated the great truth taught in the Mysteries,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">viz.</span></span>, that the sun was surely larger than the Peloponnesus, he would
              not have been persecuted and nearly put to death by the fanatical
              mob. Had that other rabble which was raised against Pythagoras
              understood what the mysterious Sage of Crotona meant by giving out
              his remembrance of having been the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Mercury”</span>—God of the Secret
              Wisdom—he would not have been forced to fly for his life; nor
              would Socrates have been put to death, had he kept secret the
              revelations of his divine Daimon. He knew how little his
              century—save those initiated—would understand his meaning, had he
              given out all he knew of the moon. Thus he limited his statement
              to an allegory, which is now proven to have been more scientific
              than was hitherto believed. He maintained that the moon was
              inhabited and that the lunar beings lived in profound, vast and
              dark valleys, our satellite being airless and without any
              atmosphere outside such profound valleys; this, disregarding the
              revelation full of meaning for the few only, must be so of
              necessity, if there is any atmosphere on our bright Selene at all.
              The facts recorded in the secret annals of the Mysteries had to
              remain veiled under penalty of death.

              The writings extant in olden times often personified Wisdom as an
              emanation and associate of the Creator. Thus we have the Hindu
              Buddha, the Babylonian Nebo, the Thoth of Memphis, the Hermes of
              Greece; also the female divinities, Neïtha, Metis, Athena, and the
              Gnostic potency Achamoth or Sophia. The Samaritan
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>
              denominated the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Genesis</span></span>, Akamouth, or Wisdom, and two remnants of old treatises, the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wisdom of Solomon</span></span>
              and the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Wisdom of Jesus</span></span>, relate to the same matters. The

              Creator. In the Secret Wisdom of the East that auxiliary is found
              collectively in the first emanations of Primeval Light, the Seven

              words, often pronounced by Jesus and his Apostles?
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye therefore perfect as your Father ... is perfect”</span>
              (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Matt.</span></span>, v. 48), says the Great Master. The words are,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“as perfect as your Father which is in heaven,”</span>
              being interpreted as meaning God. Now the utter absurdity of any
              man becoming as perfect as the infinite, all-perfect omniscient
              and omnipresent Deity, is too apparent. If you accept it in such a
              sense, Jesus is made to utter the greatest fallacy. What was
              Esoterically meant is,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Your Father who is above the material and astral man, the
                highest Principle (save the Monad) within man, his own personal
                God, or the God of his own personality, of whom he is the

                <span class="tei tei-q">‘temple.’</span> ”</span>
              <span class="tei tei-q">“If thou wilt be perfect (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, an Adept and Initiate) go and sell that thou hast”</span>
              (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Matt.</span></span>, xix. 21). Every man who desired to become a neophyte, a chelâ,
              then, as now, had to take the vow of poverty. The
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect,”</span> was the name given to
              the Initiates of every denomination. Plato calls them by that
              term. The Essenes had their
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Perfect,”</span> and Paul plainly states
              that they, the Initiates, can only speak before other Adepts.
              <span class="tei tei-q">“We speak wisdom among them [only] that are perfect”</span>

              In the Ferouers and Devs of Jacobi (Letters F. and D.) the word
              <span class="tei tei-q">“ferouer”</span> is explained in the
              following manner: The Ferouer is a part of the creature (whether
              man or animal) of which it is the type and which it survives. It
              is the Nous of the Greeks, therefore divine and immortal, and thus
              can hardly be the Devil or the satanic copy De Mirville would
              represent it (see
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions</span></span>, Vol. XXXVII. p. 623, and chap. xxxix. p. 749). Foucher
              contradicts him entirely. The Ferouer was never the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“principle of sensations,”</span> but
              always referred to the most divine and pure portion of Man's
              Ego—the spiritual principle. Anquetil says that the Ferouer is the
              purest portion of man's soul. The Persian Dev is the antithesis of
              the Ferouer, for the Dev has been transformed by Zoroaster into
              the Genius of Evil (whence the Christian Devil), but even the Dev
              is only finite; for having become possessed of the soul of man by
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">usurpation</span></em>, it will have to leave it at the great day of Retribution. The
              Dev obsesses the soul of the defunct for three days, during which
              the soul wanders about the spot at which it was forcibly separated
              from its body; the Ferouer ascends to the region of eternal Light.
              It was an unfortunate idea that made the noble Marquis de Mirville
              imagine the Ferouer to be a
              <span class="tei tei-q">“satanic copy”</span> of a
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em>
              original. By calling all the Gods of the Pagans—Apollo, Osiris,
              Brahmâ, Ormazd, Bel, etc., the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Ferouers of Christ and of the chief Angels,”</span>
              he merely exhibits the God and the Angels he would honour as
              inferior to the Pagan Gods, as man is inferior to his Soul and
              Spirit; since the Ferouer is the immortal part of the mortal being
              of which it is the type and which it survives. Perchance the poor
              author is unconsciously prophetic; and Apollo, Brahmâ, Ormazd,
              Osiris, etc., are destined to survive and replace—as eternal
              cosmic verities—the evanescent fictions about the God, Christ and
              Angels of the Latin Church!

                Now this is the conversation that took place between the
                priest-initiators and the candidates for initiation during the
                mysteries enacted in the oldest sanctuaries of the Himâlayan
                fastnesses. The ceremony is still performed to this day in one
                of the most ancient temples in a secluded spot of Nepaul. It
                originated with the Mysteries of the first Krishna, passed to
                the First Tirthankara and ended with Buddha, and is called the
                Kurukshetra rite, being enacted as a memorial of the great
                battle and death of the divine Adept. It is not Masonry, but an
                initiation into the Occult teachings of that Hero—Occultism,
                pure and simple.

              In the profane history of Gautama Buddha he dies at the good old
              age of eighty, and passes off from life to death peacefully with
              all the serenity of a great saint, as Barthélemy St. Hilaire has
              it. Not so in the Esoteric and true interpretation which reveals
              the real sense of the profane and allegorical statement that makes
              Gautama, the Buddha, die very unpoetically from the effects of too
              much pork, prepared for him by Tsonda. How one who preached that
              the killing of animals was the greatest sin, and who was a perfect
              vegetarian, could die from eating pork, is a question that is
              never asked by our Orientalists, some of whom made (as now do many
              charitable missionaries in Ceylon) great fun at the alleged
              occurrence. The simple truth is that the said rice and pork are
              purely allegorical. Rice stands for
              <span class="tei tei-q">“forbidden fruit,”</span> like Eve's
              <span class="tei tei-q">“apple,”</span> and means Occult knowledge
              with the Chinese and Tibetans; and
              <span class="tei tei-q">“pork”</span> for Brâhmanical
              teachings—Vishnu having assumed in his first Avatâra the form of a
              boar, in order to raise the earth on the surface of the waters of
              space. It is not, therefore, from
              <span class="tei tei-q">“pork”</span> that Buddha died, but for
              having divulged some of the Brâhmanical mysteries, after which,
              seeing the bad effects brought on some unworthy people by the
              revelation, he preferred, instead of availing himself of Nirvâna,
              to leave his earthly form, remaining still in the sphere of the
              living, in order to help humanity to progress. Hence his constant
              reincarnations in the hierarchy of the Dalai and Teshu Lamas,
              among other bounties. Such is the Esoteric explanation. The life
              of Gautama will be more fully discussed later on.

              Many are the marvels recorded as having taken place at his death,
              or we should rather say his translation; for he did not die as

              In its most extensive meaning, the Sanskrit word has the same
              literal sense as the Greek term; both imply
              <span class="tei tei-q">“revelation,”</span> by no human agent,
              but through the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“receiving of the sacred drink.”</span> In
              India the initiated received the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Soma,”</span> sacred drink, which helped
              to liberate his soul from the body; and in the Eleusinian
              Mysteries it was the sacred drink offered at the Epopteia. The
              Grecian Mysteries are wholly derived from the Brâhmanical Vaidic
              rites, and the latter from the Ante-Vaidic religious
              Mysteries—primitive Wisdom Philosophy.

              that name, does not necessarily imply that there was no Simon
              Magus individually distinct from Paul. It may have become a
              generic name of abuse. Theodoret and Chrysostom, the earliest and
              most prolific commentators on the Gnosticism of those days, seem
              actually to make of Simon a rival of Paul and to state that
              between them passed frequent messages. The former, as a diligent
              propagandist of what Paul terms the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“antithesis of the Gnosis”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">1. Epistle to Timothy</span></span>), must have been a sore thorn in the side of the apostle. There
              are sufficient proofs of the actual existence of Simon Magus.

              The passage runs as follows:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Aurelian had determined to destroy Tyana, and the town owed
                its salvation only to a miracle of Apollonius; this man so
                famous and so wise, this great friend of the Gods, appeared
                suddenly before the Emperor, as he was returning to his tent, in
                his own figure and form, and said to him in the Pannonian
                language:
                <span class="tei tei-q">‘Aurelian, if thou wouldst conquer, abandon these evil
                  designs against my fellow-citizens: if thou wouldst command,
                  abstain from shedding innocent blood; and if thou wouldst
                  live, abstain from injustice.’</span>
                Aurelian, familiar with the face of Apollonius, whose portraits
                he had seen in many temples, struck with wonder, immediately
                vowed to him (Apollonius) statue, portrait and temple, and
                returned completely to ideas of mercy.”</span>
              And then Vopiscus adds:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“If I have believed more and more in the virtues of the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">majestic</span></em>
                Apollonius, it is because, after gathering my information from
                the most serious men, I have found all these facts corroborated
                in the Books of the Ulpian Library.”</span>

              learned men, who made no secret of their freethought, furnished
              from among their number the most eminent of the Jewish
              high-priests, this seems impossible. How could the Pharisees and
              the other two believing and pious sects allow notorious atheists
              to be selected for such posts? The answer is difficult to find for
              bigotry and for believers in a personal, anthropomorphic God, but
              very easy for those who accept facts. The Sadducees were called
              atheists because they believed as the initiated Moses believed,
              thus differing very widely from the latter made-up Jewish
              legislator and hero of Mount Sinai.

              The Sanskrit letters are far more numerous than the poor
              twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. They are all musical,
              and they are read—or rather chanted—according to a system given in
              very old Tântrika works, and are called Devanâgarî, the speech, or
              language, of the Gods. And since each letter answers to a numeral,
              the Sanskrit affords a far larger scope for expression, and it
              must necessarily be far more perfect than the Hebrew, which
              followed the same system but could apply it only in a very limited
              way. If either of these two languages, were taught to humanity by
              the Gods, surely it would more likely be the Sanskrit, the perfect
              form of the most perfect language on earth, than the Hebrew, the
              roughest and the poorest. For once anyone believes in a language
              of divine origin, he can hardly believe at the same time that
              Angels or Gods or any divine Messengers have had to develop it
              from a rough monosyllabic form into a perfect one, as we see in
              terrestrial linguistic evolution.

              In the first chapter of
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
              the word <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> represents the
              Elohim—Gods in the plural, not one God. This is a cunning and
              dishonest translation. For the whole
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
              explains sufficiently that the Alhim (Elohim) are seven; each
              creates one of the seven things enumerated in the first chapter,
              and these answer allegorically to the seven creations. To make
              this clear, count the verses in which it is said
              <span class="tei tei-q">“And God saw that it was good,”</span> and
              you will find that this is said seven times—in verses 4, 10, 12,
              18, 21, 25, and 31. And though the compilers cunningly represent
              the creation of man as occurring on the sixth day, yet, having
              made man
              <span class="tei tei-q">“male and female in the image of God,”</span>
              the Seven Elohim repeat the sacramental sentence,
              <span class="tei tei-q">“It was good,”</span> for the seventh
              time, thus making of man the seventh creation, and showing the
              origin of this bit of cosmogony to be in the Hindu creations. The
              Elohim are, of course, the seven Egyptian Khnûmû, the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“assistant-architects”</span>; the seven
              Amshaspends of the Zoroastrians; the Seven Spirits subordinate to
              Ildabaoth of the Nazareans; the seven Prajâpati of the Hindus,
              etc.

              p. II.) (Summarized from De Mirville, Vol. II., pp. 337-338.) Thus
              the early Christian Fathers, even a non-initiate like St.
              Augustine, ascribed the creation of the visible world to Angels,
              or Secondary Powers, while St. Denys not only specifies these as
              the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Seven</span></em>
                Spirits of the Presence,”</span>
              but shows them owing their power to the informing divine
              energy—Fohat in the Secret Doctrine. But the egotistical darkness
              which caused the Western races to cling so desperately to the
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Geo</span></em>-centric System, made them also neglect and despise all those
              fragments of the true Religion which would have deprived them and
              the little globe they took for the centre of the Universe of the
              signal honour of having been expressly
              <span class="tei tei-q">“created”</span> by the One, Secondless,

              Julian died for the same crime as Socrates. Both divulged a
              portion of the solar mystery, the heliocentric system being only a
              part of what was given during Initiation—one consciously, the
              other unconsciously, the Greek Sage never having been initiated.
              It was not the real solar system that was preserved in such
              secrecy, but the mysteries connected with the Sun's constitution.
              Socrates was sentenced to death by earthly and worldly judges;
              Julian died a violent death because the hitherto protecting hand
              was withdrawn from him, and, no longer shielded by it, he was
              simply left to his destiny or Karma. For the student of Occultism
              there is a suggestive difference between the two kinds of death.
              Another memorable instance of the unconscious divulging of secrets
              pertaining to mysteries is that of the poet, P. Ovidius Naso, who,
              like Socrates, had not been initiated. In his case, the Emperor
              Augustus, who was an Initiate, mercifully changed the penalty of
              death into banishment to Tomos on the Euxine. This sudden change
              from unbounded royal favour to banishment has been a fruitful
              scheme of speculation to classical scholars not initiated into the
              Mysteries. They have quoted Ovid's own lines to show that it was
              some great and heinous immorality of the Emperor of which Ovid had
              become unwillingly cognizant. The inexorable law of the death
              penalty, always following upon the revelation of any portion of
              the Mysteries to the profane, was unknown to them. Instead of
              seeing the amiable and merciful act of the Emperor in its true
              light, they have made it an occasion for traducing his moral
              character. The poet's own words can be no evidence, because as he
              was not an Initiate, it could not be explained to him in what his
              offence consisted. There have been comparatively modern instances
              of poets unconsciously revealing in their verses so much of the
              hidden knowledge as to make even Initiates suppose them to be
              fellow-Initiates, and come to talk to them on the subject. This
              only shows that the sensitive poetic temperament is sometimes so
              far transported beyond the bounds of ordinary sense as to get
              glimpses into what has been impressed on the Astral Light. In the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Light of Asia</span></span>
              there are two passages that might make an Initiate of the first
              degree think that Mr. Edwin Arnold had been initiated himself in
              the Himâlyan
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">âshrams</span></span>, but this is not so.

              If, as Sir W. Herschel thought, the so-called fixed stars have
              resulted from, and owe their origin to nebular combustion, they
              cannot be fixed any more than is our sun, which was believed to be
              motionless and is now found to rotate around its axis every
              twenty-five days. As the fixed star nearest to the sun, however,
              is eight-thousand times farther away from him than is Neptune, the
              illusions furnished by the telescopes must be also eight-thousand
              times as great. We will therefore leave the question at rest,
              repeating only what A. Maury said in his work (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Terre et l'Homme</span></span>, published in 1858):

              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Theosophist</span></span>, care was taken each time to declare a subject incomplete when

              assert with confidence that the West may be in possession of
              Hermetic philosophy as a speculative system of dialectics, the
              latter being used in the West admirably well, but it lacks
              entirely the knowledge of Occultism. The genuine Eastern Occultist
              keeps silent and unknown, never publishes what he knows, and
              rarely even speaks of it, as he knows too well the penalty of
              indiscretion.

              <span class="tei tei-q">“The words <span class="tei tei-q">‘to create’</span> are often
                understood by the ordinary mind to convey the idea of evolving
                something out of nothing. This is clearly not its meaning. We
                are mentally obliged to provide our Creator with chaos from
                which to produce the worlds. The tiller of the soil, who is the
                typical producer of social life, must have his material: his
                earth, his sky, rain and sun, and the seeds to place within the
                earth. Out of nothing he can produce nothing. Out of a void
                nature cannot arise; there is that material beyond, behind, or
                within, from which she is shaped by our desire for a
                Universe.”</span>

              Jews, IAO, or Jehovah? That oracle had been brought by the
              Pelasgians to Dodona more than fourteen centuries
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>
              and left with the forefathers of the Hellenes, and its history is
              well-known and may be read in Herodotus. Jupiter, who loved the
              fair nymph of the ocean, Dodona, had ordered Pelasgus to carry his
              cult to Thessaly. The name of the God of that oracle at the temple
              of Dodona was Zeus Pelasgicos, the Zeuspater (God the Father), or
              as De Mirville explains:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“It was the name
                <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span>, the name that the Jews held as the ineffable, the
                unpronounceable Name—in short,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Jaoh-pater</span></span>,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
                <span class="tei tei-q">‘he who was, who is, and who will be,’</span>
                otherwise the Eternal.”</span>
              And the author admits that Maury is right
              <span class="tei tei-q">“in discovering in the name of the Vaidic Indra the Biblical
                Jehovah,”</span>
              and does not even attempt to deny the etymological connection
              between the two names—<span class="tei tei-q">“the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great</span></em>
                and the
                <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lost</span></em>
                name with the sun and the thunder-bolts.”</span>
              Strange confessions, and still stranger contradictions.

              There were no Brâhmans as a hereditary caste in days of old. In
              those long-departed ages a man became a Brâhman through personal
              merit and Initiation. Gradually, however, despotism crept in, and
              the son of a Brâhman was created a Brâhman by right of protection
              first, then by that of heredity. The rights of blood replaced
              those of real merit, and thus arose the body of Brâhmans, which
              was soon changed into a powerful caste.

              The same author had (as Occultists have) a very reasonable
              objection to the modern etymology of the word
              <span class="tei tei-q">“philosophy,”</span> which is interpreted
              <span class="tei tei-q">“love of wisdom,”</span> and is nothing of
              the kind. The philosophers were scientists, and philosophy was a
              real science—not simply verbiage, as it is in our day. The term is
              composed of two Greek words whose meaning is intended to convey
              its secret sense, and ought to be interpreted as
              <span class="tei tei-q">“wisdom of love.”</span> Now it is in the
              last word, <span class="tei tei-q">“love,”</span> that lies hidden
              the esoteric significance: for
              <span class="tei tei-q">“love”</span> does not stand here as a
              noun, nor does it mean
              <span class="tei tei-q">“affection”</span> or
              <span class="tei tei-q">“fondness,”</span> but is the term used
              for Eros, that primordial principle in divine creation, synonymous
              with πόθος, the abstract desire in Nature for procreation,
              resulting in an everlasting series of phenomena. It means
              <span class="tei tei-q">“divine love,”</span> that universal
              element of divine omnipresence spread throughout Nature and which
              is at once the chief cause and effect. The
              <span class="tei tei-q">“wisdom of love”</span> (or
              <span class="tei tei-q">“philosophia,”</span>) meant attraction to
              and love of everything hidden beneath objective phenomena and the
              knowledge thereof. Philosophy meant the highest Adeptship—love of
              and assimilation with Deity. In his modesty Pythagoras even
              refused to be called a Philosopher (or one who knows every hidden
              thing in things visible; cause and effect, or absolute truth), and
              called himself simply a Sage an aspirant to philosophy, or to
              Wisdom of Love—love in its exoteric meaning being as degraded by
              men then as it is now by its purely terrestrial application.

                Speaking of the dogma of Atonement, it is traced to ancient
                <span class="tei tei-q">“heathendom”</span> again. We say:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“This cornerstone of a church which had believed herself
                  built on a firm rock for long centuries, is now excavated by
                  science and proved to come from the Gnostics. Professor Draper
                  shows it as hardly known in the days of Tertullian, and as
                  having
                  <span class="tei tei-q">‘originated among the Gnostic heretics’</span>

                  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Conflict Between Religion and Science</span></span>, p. 224).... But there are sufficient proofs to show that it
                  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">originated</span></em>
                  among them no more than did their anointed Christos and
                  Sophia. The former they modelled on the original of the King
                  Messiah, the male principle of wisdom, and the latter on the
                  third Sephiroth, from the Chaldæan
                  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, and even from the Hindu Brahmâ and Sarasvatî, and the Pagan
                  Dionysius and Demeter. And here we are on firm ground, if it
                  were only because it is now proved that the
                  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament</span></span>
                  never appeared in its complete form, such as we find it now,
                  till 300 years after the period of the apostles, and the
                  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
                  and other Kabalistic books are found to belong to the first

                <span class="tei tei-q">“The Gnostics entertained many of the Essenean ideas; and the
                  Essenes had their greater and minor Mysteries at least two
                  centuries before our era. They were the
                  <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isarim</span></span>
                  or
                  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Initiates</span></em>, the descendants of the Egyptian hierophants, in whose
                  country they had been settled for several centuries before
                  they were converted to Buddhistic monasticism by the
                  missionaries of King Asoka, and amalgamated later with the
                  earliest Christians: and they existed, probably, before the
                  old Egyptian temples were desecrated and ruined in the
                  incessant invasions of Persians, Greeks, and other conquering
                  hordes. The hierophants had their atonement enacted in the
                  Mystery of Initiation ages before the Gnostics, or even the
                  Essenes, had appeared. It was known among hierophants as the
                  Baptism of Blood, and was considered not as an atonement for
                  the <span class="tei tei-q">‘fall of man’</span> in Eden, but
                  simply as an expiation for the past, present, and future sins
                  of ignorant, but nevertheless polluted mankind. The hierophant
                  had the option of either offering his pure and sinless life as
                  a sacrifice for his race to the gods whom he hoped to rejoin,
                  or an animal victim. The former depended entirely on their own
                  will. At the last moment of the solemn
                  <span class="tei tei-q">‘new birth,’</span> the Initiator
                  passed <span class="tei tei-q">‘the word’</span> to the
                  initiated, and immediately after the latter had a weapon
                  placed in his right hand, and was ordered
                  <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to strike</span></em>. This is the true origin of the Christian dogma of
                  atonement.”</span>

                As Ballanche says, quoted by Ragon:
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Destruction is the great God of the World,”</span>
                justifying therefore the philosophical conception of the Hindu
                Shîva. According to this immutable and sacred law,
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the Initiate was compelled to kill the Initiator; otherwise
                  initiation remained incomplete.... It is death that generates

              p. 23. J. M. Ragon, a Belgian by birth, and a Mason, knew more
              about Occultism than any other non-initiated writer. For fifty
              years he studied the ancient Mysteries wherever he could find
              accounts of them. In 1805, he founded at Paris the Brotherhood of
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Trinosophes</span></span>, in which Lodge he delivered for years lectures on Ancient and
              Modern Initiation (in 1818 and again in 1841), which were
              published, and now are lost. Then he became the writer in chief of
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hermes</span></span>, a masonic paper. His best works were
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">La Maçonnerie Occulte</span></span>
              and the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fastes Initiatiques</span></span>. After his death, in 1866, a number of his MSS. remained in the
              possession of the Grand Orient of France. A high Mason told the
              writer that Ragon had corresponded for years with two Orientalists
              in Syria and Egypt, one of whom is a Kopt gentleman.

              <span class="tei tei-q">“star-rites”</span> of the Pagan
              Initiates. In the pre-Christian Mithraic Mysteries, the candidate

              disc, and known as the manna (heavenly bread).... A lamb, or a
              bull even, was killed, and with the blood the candidate had to be
              sprinkled, as in the case of the Emperor Julian's initiation. The

              The impartial study of Vaidic and Post-Vaidic works shows that the

              <span class="tei tei-q">“that they changed their position from a certain asterism to
                two (occasionally three) asterisms back whenever the precession
                amounted to two, properly speaking, to 2 11/61 asterisms or
                about 29°, being the motion of the sun in a lunar month, and so
                caused the seasons to fall back a complete lunar month.... It
                appears certain that at the date of
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sûrya Siddhânta</span></span>,
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brahmâ Siddânta</span></span>, and other ancient treatises on astronomy, the vernal
                equinoctial point had not actually reached the beginning of
                Ashvinî, but was a few degrees east of it.... The astronomers of
                Europe change westward the beginning of Aries and of all other
                signs of the Zodiac every year by about 50" 25, and thus make
                the names of the signs meaningless. But these signs are as much
                fixed as the asterisms themselves, and hence the Western
                astronomers of the present day appear to us in this respect less

              two diametrically opposed poles of religion and science, the one
              with its barren fields of dogmas on faith, the other over-running

              They will never meet. The two are at feud, at an everlasting

              uniting against Esoteric Philosophy, which for two millenniums has

              About fifty years before the birth of Copernicus, de Cusa wrote as
              follows:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Though the world may not be absolutely infinite, no one can
                represent it to himself as finite, since human reason is
                incapable of assigning to it any term.... For in the same way
                that our earth cannot be in the centre of the Universe, as
                thought, no more could the sphere of the fixed stars be in
                it.... Thus this world is like a vast machine, having its centre
                [Deity] everywhere, and its circumference nowhere [<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">machina mundi, quasi habens ubique centrum, et nullibi
                    circumferentiam</span></span>].... Hence, the earth not being in the centre, cannot
                therefore be motionless ... and though it is far smaller than
                the sun, one must not conclude for all that, that she is worse
                [<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vilior</span></span>—more vile].... One cannot see whether its inhabitants are
                superior to those who dwell nearer to the sun, or in other
                stars, as sidereal space cannot be deprived of inhabitants....
                The earth, very likely [<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">fortasse</span></span>] one of the smallest globes, is nevertheless the cradle of
                intelligent beings, most noble and perfect.”</span>
              One cannot fail to agree with the biographer of Cardinal de Cusa,
              who, having no suspicion of the Occult truth, and the reason of
              such erudition in a writer of the fourteenth and fifteenth
              centuries, simply marvels at such a miraculous foreknowledge, and
              attributes it to God, saying of him that he was a man incomparable
              in every kind of philosophy, by whom many a theological mystery
              inaccessible to the human mind (!), veiled and neglected for
              centuries (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">velata et neglecta</span></span>) were once more brought to light.
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Pascal might have read De Cusa's works; but whence could the
                Cardinal have borrowed his ideas?”</span>
              asks Moreri. Evidently from Hermes and the works of Pythagoras,
              even if the mystery of his incarnation and re-incarnation be
              dismissed.

              The secret meaning of this sentence is that Karma exercises its

              <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods”</span> can escape it as little as
              simple mortals. The Adept who, having reached the Path and won His
              Dharmakâya—the Nirvâna from which there is no return until the new
              grand Kalpa—prefers to use His right of choosing a condition
              inferior to that which belongs to Him, but that will leave him
              free to return whenever He thinks it advisable and under whatever

              chances of failure—possibly—and a lower condition than was His
              lot—for a certainty—as it is an occult law. Karma alone is
              absolute justice and infallible in its selections. He who uses his
              rights with it (Karma) must bear the consequences—if any. Thus

                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kahgyur</span></span>
                and
                <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bstanhgyur</span></span>, comprises 1707 distinct works—1083 public and 624 secret
                volumes, the former being composed of 350 and the latter of 77
                volumes folio. May we humbly invite the good missionaries,
                however, to tell us when they ever succeeded in getting a
                glimpse of the last-named secret folios? Had they even by chance
                seen them I can assure the Western Pandits that these
                manuscripts and folios could never be understood even by a born
                Tibetan without a key (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) to their peculiar characters, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) to their hidden meaning. In our system every description of
                locality is figurative, every name and word purposely veiled;
                and one has first to study the mode of deciphering and then to
                learn the equivalent secret terms and symbols for nearly every
                word of the religious language. The Egyptian enchorial or
                hieratic system is child's play to our sacerdotal
                puzzles.”</span>

              <span class="tei tei-q">“Despite the assertion of Herodotus and others that the Bacchic

                Buddhistical. Kore-Persep-honeia was but the goddess
                Parasu-pani, or Bhavani, and Zagreus is from Chakra, a country
                extending from ocean to ocean. If this is a Turanian story we

                <span class="tei tei-q">‘horns’</span> as the crescent worn by
                Lama-priests, and assume the whole legend [the fable of
                Dionysus-Zagreus] to be based on Lama-succession and
                transmigration.... The whole story of Orpheus ... has a Hindu
                ring all through.”</span>

              <span class="tei tei-q">“Lama-succession and transmigration”</span>
              did not originate with the Lamas, who date themselves only so far

              star. It was adopted as a planet by the post-Christian
              Astrologers, who had never been initiated. Moreover, the true
              colour of the Sun is blue, and it appears yellow only owing to the
              effect of the absorption of vapours (chiefly metallic) by its

              Esoterically, indigo, or dark blue, which is the complement of
              yellow in the prism. Yellow is a simple or primitive colour. Manas
              being dual in its nature—as is its sidereal symbol, the planet
              Venus, which is both the morning and evening star—the difference
              between the higher and the lower principles of Manas, whose
              essence is derived from the Hierarchy ruling Venus, is denoted by
              the dark blue and green. Green, the Lower Manas, resembles the
              colour of the solar spectrum which appears between the yellow and
              the dark blue, the Higher Spiritual Manas. Indigo is the
              intensified colour of the heaven or sky, to denote the upward
              tendency of Manas toward Buddhi, or the heavenly Spiritual Soul.
              This colour is obtained from the
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">indigofera tinctoria</span></span>, a plant of the highest occult properties in India, much used in
              White Magic, and occultly connected with copper. This is shown by
              the indigo assuming a copper lustre, especially when rubbed on any
              hard substance. Another property of the dye is that it is
              insoluble in water and even in ether, being lighter in weight than
              any known liquid. No symbol has ever been adopted in the East
              without being based upon a logical and demonstrable reason.
              Therefore Eastern Symbologists, from the earliest ages, have
              connected the spiritual and the animal minds of man, the one with
              dark blue (Newton's indigo), or true blue, free from green; and
              the other with pure green.

              colour. The planet for which the Sun is a substitute was still
              nearer the Sun than Mercury now is, and was one of the most secret
              and highest planets. It is said to have become invisible at the

              Esoterically, violet, because, perhaps, violet is the colour
              assumed by a ray of sunlight when transmitted through a very thin
              plate of silver, and also because the Moon shines upon the Earth
              with light borrowed from the Sun, as the human body shines with
              qualifications borrowed from its double—the aërial man. As the
              astral shadow starts the series of principles in man, on the
              terrestrial plane, up to the lower, animal Manas, so the violet
              ray starts the series of prismatic colours from its end up to
              green, both being, the one as a principle and the other as a
              colour, the most refrangible of all the principles and colours.
              Besides which, there is the same great Occult mystery attached to
              all these correspondences, both celestial and terrestrial bodies,
              colours and sounds. In clearer words, there exists the same law of
              relation between the Moon and the Earth, the astral and the living
              body of man, as between the violet end of the prismatic spectrum
              and the indigo and the blue. But of this more anon.

              At first there are the omphalo-mesenteric vessels, two arteries
              and two veins, but these afterwards totally disappear, as does the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“vascular area”</span> on the Umbilical
              Vesicle, from which they proceed. As regards the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Umbilical Vessels”</span> proper, the
              Umbilical Cord ultimately has entwined around it from right to
              left the one Umbilical Vein which takes the oxygenated blood from
              the mother to the Fœtus, and two Hypogastric or Umbilical Arteries
              which take the used-up blood from the Fœtus to the Placenta, the
              contents of the vessels being the reverse of that which prevails
              after birth. Thus Science corroborates the wisdom and knowledge of
              ancient Occultism, for in the days of Simon Magus no man, unless
              an Initiate, knew anything about the circulation of the blood or
              about Physiology. While this Paper was being printed, I received
              two small pamphlets from Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, which were
              printed in 1884 and 1888, and in which is to be found the
              scientific demonstration of the fœtal nutrition as advanced in
              Paper I. Briefly, the Fœtus is nourished by osmosis from the
              Amniotic Fluid and respires by means of the Placenta. Science
              knows little or nothing about the Amniotic Fluid and its uses. If
              any one cares to follow up this question, I would recommend Dr.
              Anderson's

              in its details is purely Tântric, and nothing but harm can result

              strongly dissuade any student from attempting any of these Hatha
              Yoga practices, for he will either ruin himself entirely, or throw
              himself so far back that it will be almost impossible to regain
              the lost ground in this incarnation. The translation referred to
              has been considerably expurgated, and even now is hardly fit for
              publication. It recommends Black Magic of the worst kind, and is
              the very antipodes of spiritual Râja Yoga. Beware, I say.

              inner organ of perception and is divided into four parts: the
              (lower) Manas, Buddhi (reason), Ahankâra (personality), and Chitta

</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
