<p>A stirring freshness in the air, and ruddy streaks upon the horizon
of the moral world betoken the grateful dawning of a new era. The days
of a drivelling instruction are departing. With us is the opening
promise of a better time, wherein genuine manhood doing its noblest
work shall have adequate reward. <span class="allsmcap">TEACHER</span>
is the highest and most responsible office man can fill. Its dignity
is, and will yet be held commensurate with its duty—a duty boundless
as man's intellectual capacity, and great as his moral need—a duty
from the performance of which shall emanate an influence not limited
to the <i>now</i> and the <i>here</i>, but which surely will, as time
flows into eternity and space into infinity, roll up, a measureless
curse or a measureless blessing, in inconceivable swellings along the
infinite curve. It is an office that should be esteemed of even sacred
import in this country. Ere long a hundred millions, extending from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Baffin's Bay to that of Panama,
shall call themselves American citizens. What a field for those two
master-passions of the human soul—the love of Rule, and the love
of Gain! How shall our liberties continue to be preserved from the
graspings of Ambition and the corruptions of Gold? Not by Bills of
Rights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span> Constitutions,
and Statute Books; but alone by the rightly cultivated hearts and heads
of the <span class="allsmcap">PEOPLE</span>. They must themselves guard
the Ark. It is yours to fit them for the consecrated charge. Look well
to it: for you appear clothed in the majesty of great power! It is
yours to fashion, and to inform, to save, and to perpetuate. You are
the Educators of the People: you are the prime Conservators of the
public weal. Betray your trust, and the sacred fires would go out,
and the altars crumble into dust: knowledge become lost in tradition,
and Christian nobleness a fable! As you, therefore, are multiplied in
number, elevated in consideration, increased in means, and fulfill,
well and faithfully, all the requirements of true Teachers, so shall
our favoured land lift up her head among the nations of the earth, and
call herself blessed.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Gentlemen, to you, as the conspicuous leaders
in the vast and honourable labour of Educational Reform, and
Popular Teaching, the First American Edition of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> of Newton—the greatest work of the
greatest Teacher—is most respectfully dedicated.</p>

INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION.</h2>
</div>


<p>THAT the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> of Newton should
have remained so generally unknown in this country to the present
day is a somewhat remarkable fact; because the name of the author,
learned with the very elements of science, is revered at every
hearth-stone where knowledge and virtue are of chief esteem, while,
abroad, in all the high places of the land, the character which that
name recalls is held up as the noblest illustration of what <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span> may be, and may do, in the possession and
manifestation of pre-eminent intellectual and moral worth; because
the work is celebrated, not only in the history of one career and one
mind, but in the history of all achievement and human reason itself;
because of the spirit of inquiry, which has been aroused, and which, in
pursuing its searchings, is not always satisfied with stopping short
of the fountain-head of any given truth; and, finally, because of the
earnest endeavour that has been and is constantly going on, in many
sections of the Republic, to elevate the popular standard of education
and give to scientific and other efforts a higher and a better aim.</p>

<p>True, the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> has been hitherto
inaccessible to popular use. A few copies in Latin, and occasionally
one in English may be found in some of our larger libraries, or in the
possession of some ardent disciple of the great Master. But a dead
language in the one case, and an enormous price in both, particularly
in that of the English edition, have thus far opposed very sufficient
obstacles to the wide circulation of the work. It is now, however,
placed within the reach of all. And in performing this labour, the
utmost care has been taken, by collation, revision, and otherwise, to
render the First American Edition the most accurate and beautiful in
our language. "Le plus beau monument que l'on puisse élever à la gloire
de Newton, c'est une bonne édition de ses ouvrages:" and a monument
like unto that we would here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</span> 
set up. The <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>, above all, glows
with the immortality of a transcendant mind. Marble and brass dissolve
and pass away; but the true creations of genius endure, in time and
beyond time, forever: high upon the adamant of the indestructible, they
send forth afar and near, over the troublous waters of life, a pure,
unwavering, quenchless light whereby the myriad myriads of barques,
richly laden with reason, intelligence and various faculty, are guided
through the night and the storm, by the beetling shore and the hidden
rock, the breaker and the shoal, safely into havens calm and secure.</p>

<p>To the teacher and the taught, the scholar and the student,
the devotee of Science and the worshipper of Truth, the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> must ever continue to be of
inestimable value. If to educate means, not so much to store the
memory with symbols and facts, as to bring forth the faculties of the
soul and develope them to the full by healthy nurture and a hardy
discipline, then, what so effective to the accomplishment of that
end as the study of Geometrical Synthesis? The Calculus, in some
shape or other, is, indeed, necessary to the successful prosecution
of researches in the higher branches of philosophy. But has not the
Analytical encroached upon the Synthetical, and Algorithmic Formulæ
been employed when not requisite, either for the evolution of truth,
or even its apter illustration? To each method belongs, undoubtedly,
an appropriate use. Newton, himself the inventor of Fluxions, censured
the handling of Geometrical subjects by Algebraical calculations; and
the maturest opinions which he expressed were additionally in favour
of the Geometrical Method. His preference, so strongly marked, is not
to be reckoned a mere matter of taste; and his authority should bear
with preponderating weight upon the decision of every instructor in
adopting what may be deemed the best plan to insure the completest
mental development. Geometry, the vigorous product of remote time;
blended with the earliest aspirations of Science and the earliest
applications of Art; as well in the measures of music as in the
movement of spheres; as wholly in the structure of the atom as in
that of the world; directing <span class="allsmcap">MOTION</span> and
shaping <span class="allsmcap">APPEARANCE</span>; in a word, at the
moulding of the created all, is, in comprehensive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</span> 
view, the outward form of that Inner Harmony of which and in which
all things are. Plainly, therefore, this noble study has other and
infinitely higher uses than to increase the power of abstraction. A
more general and thorough cultivation of it should be strenuously
insisted on. Passing from the pages of Euclid or Legendre, might not
the student be led, at the suitable time, to those of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>
wherein Geometry may be found in varied use from the familiar to the
sublime? The profoundest and the happiest results, it is believed,
would attend upon this enlargement of our Educational System.</p>

<p>Let the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>, then, be gladly welcomed into every Hall where a
<span class="allsmcap">TRUE TEACHER</span> presides. And they who are guided to the diligent study of

<p>FROM the thick darkness of the middle ages man's struggling
spirit emerged as in new birth; breaking out of the iron control
of that period; growing strong and confident in the tug and din of
succeeding conflict and revolution, it bounded forwards and upwards
with resistless vigour to the investigation of physical and moral
truth; ascending height after height; sweeping afar over the earth,
penetrating afar up into the heavens; increasing in endeavour,
enlarging in endowment; every where boldly, earnestly out-stretching,
till, in the<span class="allsmcap"> AUTHOR</span> of the 
<span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>, one arose, who, grasping the
master-key of the universe and treading its celestial paths, opened
up to the human intellect the stupendous realities of the material
world, and, in the unrolling of its harmonies, gave to the human heart
a new song to the goodness, wisdom, and majesty of the all-creating,
all-sustaining, all-perfect God.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton, in whom the rising intellect seemed to attain, as it
were, to its culminating point, was born on the 25th of December, O. S.
1642—Christmas day—at Woolsthorpe, in the parish of Colsterworth, in
Lincolnshire. His father, John Newton, died at the age of thirty-six,
and only a few months after his marriage to Harriet Ayscough, daughter
of James Ayscough, of Rutlandshire. Mrs. Newton, probably wrought upon
by the early loss of her husband, gave premature birth to her only
and posthumous child, of which, too, from its extreme diminutiveness,
she appeared likely to be soon bereft. Happily, it was otherwise
decreed! The tiny infant, on whose little lips the breath of life<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span> so
doubtingly hovered, lived;—lived to a vigorous maturity, to a hale old
age;—lived to become the boast of his country, the wonder of his time,
and the "ornament of his species."</p>

<p>Beyond the grandfather, Robert Newton, the descent of Sir Isaac cannot
with certainty be traced. Two traditions were held in the family:
one, that they were of Scotch extraction; the other, that they came
originally from Newton, in Lancashire, dwelling, for a time, however,
at Westby, county of Lincoln, before the removal to and purchase of
Woolsthorpe—about a hundred years before this memorable birth.</p>

<p>The widow Newton was left with the simple means of a comfortable
subsistence. The Woolsthorpe estate together with a small one which she
possessed at Sewstern, in Leicestershire, yielded her an income of some
eighty pounds; and upon this limited sum, she had to rely chiefly for
the support of herself, and the education of her child. She continued
his nurture for three years, when, marrying again, she confided the
tender charge to the care of her own mother.</p>

<p>Great genius is seldom marked by precocious development; and young
Isaac, sent, at the usual age, to two day schools at Skillington and
Stoke, exhibited no unusual traits of character. In his twelfth year,
he was placed at the public school at Grantham, and boarded at the
house of Mr. Clark, an apothecary. But even in this excellent seminary,
his mental acquisitions continued for a while unpromising enough: study
apparently had no charms for him; he was very inattentive, and ranked
low in the school. One day, however, the boy immediately above our
seemingly dull student gave him a severe kick in the stomach; Isaac,
deeply affected, but with no outburst of passion, betook himself,
with quiet, incessant toil, to his books; he quickly passed above the
offending classmate; yet there he stopped not; the strong spirit was,
for once and forever, awakened, and, yielding to its noble impulse, he
speedily took up his position at the head of all.</p>

<p>His peculiar character began now rapidly to unfold itself. Close
application grew to be habitual. Observation alternated with
reflection. "A sober, silent, thinking lad," yet, the wisest and
the kindliest, the indisputable leader of his fellows. Generosity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
modesty, and a love of truth distinguished him then as ever afterwards.
He did not often join his classmates in play; but he would contrive
for them various amusements of a scientific kind. Paper kites he
introduced; carefully determining their best form and proportions,
and the position and number of points whereby to attach the string.
He also invented paper lanterns; these served ordinarily to guide the
way to school in winter mornings, but occasionally for quite another
purpose; they were attached to the tails of kites in a dark night, to
the dismay of the country people dreading portentous comets, and to
the immeasurable delight of his companions. To him, however, young
as he was, life seemed to have become an earnest thing. When not
occupied with his studies, his mind would be engrossed with mechanical
contrivances; now imitating, now inventing. He became singularly
skilful in the use of his little saws, hatchets, hammers, and other
tools. A windmill was erected near Grantham; during the operations
of the workmen, he was frequently present; in a short time, he had
completed a perfect working model of it, which elicited general
admiration. Not content, however, with this exact imitation, he
conceived the idea of employing, in the place of sails, animal power,
and, adapting the construction of his mill accordingly, he enclosed
in it a mouse, called the miller, and which by acting on a sort of
treadwheel, gave motion to the machine. He invented, too, a mechanical
carriage—having four wheels, and put in motion with a handle worked
by the person sitting inside. The measurement of time early drew
his attention. He first constructed a water clock, in proportions
somewhat like an old-fashioned house clock. The index of the dial
plate was turned by a piece of wood acted upon by dropping water. This
instrument, though long used by himself, and by Mr. Clark's family,
did not satisfy his inquiring mind. His thoughts rose to the sun;
and, by careful and oft-repeated observations of the solar movements,
he subsequently formed many dials. One of these, named <i>Isaac's
dial</i>, was the accurate result of years' labour, and was frequently
referred to for the hour of the day by the country people.</p>

<p>May we not discern in these continual efforts—the diligent research,
the patient meditation, the aspiring glance, and the energy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span> of
discovery—the stirring elements of that wondrous spirit, which, clear,
calm, and great, moved, in after years, through deep onward through
deep of Nature's mysteries, unlocking her strongholds, dispelling
darkness, educing order—everywhere silently conquering.</p>

<p>Newton had an early and decided taste for drawing. Pictures, taken
sometimes from copies, but often from life, and drawn, coloured and
framed by himself, ornamented his apartment. He was skilled also,
in poetical composition, "excelled in making verses;" some of these
were borne in remembrance and repeated, seventy years afterward, by
Mrs. Vincent, for whom, in early youth, as Miss Storey, he formed an
ardent attachment. She was the sister of a physician resident near
Woolsthorpe; but Newton's intimate acquaintance with her began at
Grantham, where they were both numbered among the inmates of the same
house. Two or three years younger than himself, of great personal
beauty, and unusual talent, her society afforded him the greatest
pleasure; and their youthful friendship, it is believed, gradually rose
to a higher passion; but inadequacy of fortune prevented their union.
Miss Storey was afterwards twice married; Newton, never; his esteem for
her continued unabated during life, accompanied by numerous acts of
attention and kindness.</p>

<p>In 1656, Newton's mother was again left a widow, and took up her abode
once more at Woolsthorpe. He was now fifteen years of age, and had made
great progress in his studies; but she, desirous of his help, and from
motives of economy, recalled him from school. Business occupations,
however, and the management of the farm, proved utterly distasteful to
him. When sent to Grantham Market on Saturdays, he would betake himself
to his former lodgings in the apothecary's garret, where some of Mr.
Clark's old books employed his thoughts till the aged and trustworthy
servant had executed the family commissions and announced the necessity
of return: or, at other times, our young philosopher would seat himself
under a hedge, by the wayside, and continue his studies till the same
faithful personage—proceeding alone to the town and completing the
day's business—stopped as he returned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span> The more immediate affairs of
the farm received no better attention. In fact, his passion for study
grew daily more absorbing, and his dislike for every other occupation
more intense. His mother, therefore, wisely resolved to give him all
the advantages which an education could confer. He was sent back to
Grantham school, where he remained for some months in busy preparation
for his academical studies. At the recommendation of one of his uncles,
who had himself studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton proceeded
thither, and was duly admitted, on the 5th day of June 1660, in the
eighteenth year of his age.</p>

<p>The eager student had now entered upon a new and wider field; and we
find him devoting himself to the pursuit of knowledge with amazing
ardour and perseverance. Among other subjects, his attention was soon
drawn to that of Judicial Astrology. He exposed the folly of this
pseudo-science by erecting a figure with the aid of one or two of the
problems of Euclid;—and thus began his study of the Mathematics.
His researches into this science were prosecuted with unparalleled
vigour and success. Regarding the propositions contained in Euclid as
self-evident truths, he passed rapidly over this ancient system—a
step which he afterward much regretted—and mastered, without further
preparatory study, the Analytical Geometry of Descartes. Wallis's
Arithmetic of Infinites, Saunderson's Logic, and the Optics of Kepler,
he also studied with great care; writing upon them many comments;
and, in these notes on Wallis's work was undoubtedly the germ of his
fluxionary calculus. His progress was so great that he found himself
more profoundly versed than his tutor in many branches of learning.
Yet his acquisitions were not gotten with the rapidity of intuition;
but they were thoroughly made and firmly secured. Quickness of
apprehension, or intellectual nimbleness did not belong to him. He saw
too far: his insight was too deep. He dwelt fully, cautiously upon the
least subject; while to the consideration of the greatest, he brought
a massive strength joined with a matchless clearness, that, regardless
of the merely trivial or unimportant, bore with unerring sagacity upon
the prominences of the subject, and, grappling with its difficulties,
rarely failed to surmount them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>His early and fast friend, Dr. Barrow—in compass of invention only
inferior to Newton—who had been elected Professor of Greek in the
University, in 1660, was made Lucasian Professor of Mathematics
in 1663, and soon afterward delivered his Optical Lectures: the
manuscripts of these were revised by Newton, and several oversights
corrected, and many important suggestions made by him; but they were
not published till 1669.</p>

<p>In the year 1665, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts; and, in
1666, he entered upon those brilliant and imposing discoveries which
have conferred inappreciable benefits upon science, and immortality
upon his own name.</p>

<p>Newton, himself, states that he was in possession of his Method
of Fluxions, "in the year 1666, or before." Infinite quantities had
long been a subject of profound investigation; among the ancients by
Archimedes, and Pappus of Alexandria; among the moderns by Kepler,
Cavaleri, Roberval, Fermat and Wallis. With consummate ability Dr.
Wallis had improved upon the labours of his predecessors: with a
higher power, Newton moved forwards from where Wallis stopped. Our
author first invented his celebrated <span class="allsmcap">BINOMIAL
THEOREM</span>. And then, applying this Theorem to the rectification
of curves, and to the determination of the surfaces and contents of
solids, and the position of their centres of gravity, he discovered
the general principle of deducing the areas of curves from the
ordinate, by considering the area as a nascent quantity, increasing
by continual fluxion in the proportion of the length of the ordinate,
and supposing the abscissa to increase uniformly in proportion to the
time. Regarding lines as generated by the motion of points, surfaces
by the motion of lines, and solids by the motion of surfaces, and
considering that the ordinates, abscissae, &amp;c., of curves thus
formed, vary according to a regular law depending on the equation
of the curve, he deduced from this equation the velocities with
which these quantities are generated, and obtained by the rules of
infinite series, the ultimate value required. To the velocities
with which every line or quantity is generated, he gave the name
of <span class="allsmcap">FLUXIONS</span>, and to the lines or
quantities themselves, that of <span class="allsmcap">FLUENTS</span>.
A discovery that successively baffled the acutest and strongest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span> intellects:—that, variously
modified, has proved of incalculable service in aiding to develope the
most abstruse and the highest truths in Mathematics and Astronomy: and
that was of itself enough to render any name illustrious in the crowded
Annals of Science.</p>

<p>At this period, the most distinguished philosophers were directing
all their energies to the subject of light and the improvement of the
refracting telescope. Newton, having applied himself to the grinding
of "optic glasses of other figures than spherical," experienced the
impracticability of executing such lenses; and conjectured that their
defects, and consequently those of refracting telescopes, might arise
from some other cause than the imperfect convergency of rays to a
single point. He accordingly "procured a triangular glass prism to
try therewith the celebrated phenomena of colours." His experiments,
entered upon with zeal, and conducted with that industry, accuracy,
and patient thought, for which he was so remarkable, resulted in the
grand conclusion, that <span class="allsmcap">LIGHT WAS NOT HOMOGENEOUS, BUT CONSISTED OF
RAYS, SOME OF WHICH WERE MORE REFRANGIBLE THAN OTHERS</span>. This profound
and beautiful discovery opened up a new era in the History of Optics.
As bearing, however, directly upon the construction of telescopes,
he saw that a lens refracting exactly like a prism would necessarily
bring the different rays to different foci, at different distances from
the glass, confusing and rendering the vision indistinct. Taking for
granted that all bodies produced spectra of equal length, he dismissed
all further consideration of the refracting instrument, and took up the
principle of reflection. Rays of all colours, he found, were reflected
regularly, so that the angle of reflection was equal to the angle of
incidence, and hence he concluded that <i>optical instruments might be
brought to any degree of perfection imaginable</i>, provided reflecting
specula of the requisite figure and finish could be obtained. At this
stage of his optical researches, he was forced to leave Cambridge on
account of the plague which was then desolating England.</p>

<p>He retired to Woolsthorpe. The old manor-house, in which he was born,
was situated in a beautiful little valley, on the west side of the
river Witham; and here in the quiet home of his boyhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span> he passed
his days in serene contemplation, while the stalking pestilence was
hurrying its tens of thousands into undistinguishable graves.</p>

<p>Towards the close of a pleasant day in the early autumn of 1666,
he was seated alone beneath a tree, in his garden, absorbed in
meditation. He was a slight young man; in the twenty-fourth year of
his age; his countenance mild and full of thought. For a century
previous, the science of Astronomy had advanced with rapid strides.
The human mind had risen from the gloom and bondage of the middle
ages, in unparalleled vigour, to unfold the system, to investigate
the phenomena, and to establish the laws of the heavenly bodies.
Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and others had prepared and
lighted the way for him who was to give to their labour its just value,
and to their genius its true lustre. At his bidding isolated facts
were to take order as parts of one harmonious whole, and sagacious
conjectures grow luminous in the certain splendour of demonstrated
truth. And this ablest man had come—was here. His mind, familiar with
the knowledge of past effort, and its unequalled faculties developed
in transcendant strength, was now moving on to the very threshold of
its grandest achievement. Step by step the untrodden path was measured,
till, at length, the entrance seemed disclosed, and the tireless
explorer to stand amid the first opening wonders of the universe.</p>

<p>The nature of gravity—that mysterious power which causes all bodies
to descend towards the centre of the earth—had, indeed, dawned upon
him. And reason busily united link to link of that chain which was
yet to be traced joining the least to the vastest, the most remote to
the nearest, in one harmonious bond. From the bottoms of the deepest
caverns to the summits of the highest mountains, this power suffers
no sensible change: may not its action, then, extend to the moon?
Undoubtedly: and further reflection convinced him that such a power
might be sufficient for retaining that luminary in her orbit round
the earth. But, though this power suffers no sensible variation, in
the little change of distance from the earth's centre, at which we
may place ourselves, yet, at the distance of the moon, may not its
force undergo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span> more or less diminution? The conjecture appeared most
probable: and, in order to estimate what the degree of diminution might
be, he considered that if the moon be retained in her orbit by the
force of gravity, the primary planets must also be carried round the
sun by the like power; and, by comparing the periods of the several
planets with their distances from the sun, he found that, if they were
held in their courses by any power like gravity, its strength must
decrease in the duplicate proportion of the increase of distance. In
forming this conclusion, he supposed the planets to move in perfect
circles, concentric to the sun. Now was this the law of the moon's
motion? Was such a force, emanating from the earth and directed to the
moon, sufficient, when diminished as the square of the distance, to
retain her in her orbit? To ascertain this master-fact, he compared the
space through which heavy bodies fall, in a second of time, at a given
distance from the centre of the earth, namely, at its surface, with
the space through which the moon falls, as it were, to the earth, in
the same time, while revolving in a circular orbit. He was absent from
books; and, therefore, adopted, in computing the earth's diameter, the
common estimate of sixty miles to a degree of latitude as then in use
among geographers and navigators. The result of his calculations did
not, of course, answer his expectations; hence, he concluded that some
other cause, beyond the reach of observation—analogous, perhaps, to
the vortices of Descartes—joined its action to that of the power of
gravity upon the moon. Though by no means satisfied, he yet abandoned
awhile further inquiry, and remained totally silent upon the subject.</p>

<p>These rapid marches in the career of discovery, combined with the
youth of Newton, seem to evince a penetration the most lively, and an
invention the most exuberant. But in him there was a conjunction of
influences as extraordinary as fortunate. Study, unbroken, persevering
and profound carried on its informing and disciplining work upon a
genius, natively the greatest, and rendered freest in its movements,
and clearest in its vision, through the untrammelling and enlightening
power of religion. And, in this happy concurrence, are to be sought
the elements of those amazing abilities, which, grasping, with equal
facility, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span> minute and the stupendous, brought these successively to
light, and caused science to make them her own.</p>

<p>In 1667, Newton was made a Junior Fellow; and, in the year following,
he took his degree of Master of Arts, and was appointed to a Senior
Fellowship.</p>

<p>On his return to Cambridge, in 1668, he resumed his optical labours.
Having thought of a delicate method of polishing metal, he proceeded
to the construction of his newly projected reflecting telescope; a
small specimen of which he actually made with his own hands. It was six
inches long; and magnified about forty times;—a power greater than a
refracting instrument of six feet tube could exert with distinctness.
Jupiter, with his four satellites, and the horns, or moon-like phases
of Venus were plainly visible through it. <span class="allsmcap">THIS WAS THE FIRST REFLECTING
TELESCOPE EVER EXECUTED AND DIRECTED TO THE HEAVENS</span>. He gave an account
of it, in a letter to a friend, dated February 23d, 1668-9—a letter
which is also remarkable for containing the first allusion to his
discoveries "concerning the nature of light." Encouraged by the success
of his first experiment, he again executed with his own hands, not
long afterward, a second and superior instrument of the same kind. The
existence of this having come to the knowledge of the Royal Society
of London, in 1671, they requested it of Newton for examination. He
accordingly sent it to them. It excited great admiration; it was shown
to the king; a drawing and description of it was sent to Paris; and the
telescope itself was carefully preserved in the Library of the Society.
Newton lived to see his invention in public use, and of eminent service
in the cause of science.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1669, he wrote to his friend Francis Aston, Esq., then
about setting out on his travels, a letter of advice and directions,
it was dated May 18th, and is interesting as exhibiting some of the
prominent features in Newton's character. Thus:—</p>

<p>"Since in your letter you give me so much liberty of spending my
judgment about what may be to your advantage in travelling, I shall do
it more freely than perhaps otherwise would have been decent. First,
then, I will lay down some general rules, most of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span> which, I believe,
you have considered already; but if any of them be new to you, they may
excuse the rest; if none at all, yet is my punishment more in writing
than yours in reading.</p>

<p>"When you come into any fresh company. 1. Observe their humours. 2.
Suit your own carriage thereto, by which insinuation you will make
their converse more free and open. 3. Let your discourse be more in
queries and doubtings than peremptory assertions or disputings, it
being the design of travellers to learn, not to teach. Besides, it
will persuade your acquaintance that you have the greater esteem of
them, and so make them more ready to communicate what they know to
you; whereas nothing sooner occasions disrespect and quarrels than
peremptoriness. You will find little or no advantage in seeming wiser
or much more ignorant than your company. 4. Seldom discommend anything
though never so bad, or do it but moderately, lest you be unexpectedly
forced to an unhandsome retraction. It is safer to commend any thing
more than it deserves, than to discommend a thing so much as it
deserves; for commendations meet not so often with oppositions, or, at
least, are not usually so ill resented by men that think otherwise, as
discommendations; and you will insinuate into men's favour by nothing
sooner than seeming to approve and commend what they like; but beware
of doing it by comparison. 5. If you be affronted, it is better, in a
foreign country, to pass it by in silence, and with a jest, though with
some dishonour, than to endeavour revenge; for, in the first case, your
credit's ne'er the worse when you return into England, or come into
other company that have not heard of the quarrel. But, in the second
case, you may bear the marks of the quarrel while you live, if you
outlive it at all. But, if you find yourself unavoidably engaged, 'tis
best, I think, if you can command your passion and language, to keep
them pretty evenly at some certain moderate pitch, not much heightening
them to exasperate your adversary, or provoke his friends, nor letting
them grow overmuch dejected to make him insult. In a word, if you
can keep reason above passion, that and watchfulness will be your
best defendants. To which purpose you may consider, that, though such
excuses as this—He provok't me so much I could not forbear—may pass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
among friends, yet amongst strangers they are insignificant, and only
argue a traveller's weakness.</p>

<p>"To these I may add some general heads for inquiries or observations,
such as at present I can think on. As, 1. To observe the policies,
wealth, and state affairs of nations, so far as a solitary traveller
may conveniently do. 2. Their impositions upon all sorts of people,
trades, or commodities, that are remarkable. 3. Their laws and customs,
how far they differ from ours. 4. Their trades and arts wherein they
excel or come short of us in England. 5. Such fortifications as you
shall meet with, their fashion, strength, and advantages for defence,
and other such military affairs as are considerable. 6. The power
and respect belonging to their degrees of nobility or magistracy. 7.
It will not be time misspent to make a catalogue of the names and
excellencies of those men that are most wise, learned, or esteemed in
any nation. 8. Observe the mechanism and manner of guiding ships. 9.
Observe the products of Nature in several places, especially in mines,
with the circumstances of mining and of extracting metals or minerals
out of their ore, and of refining them; and if you meet with any
transmutations out of their own species into another (as out of iron
into copper, out of any metal into quicksilver, out of one salt into
another, or into an insipid body, &amp;c.), those, above all, will be worth
your noting, being the most luciferous, and many times lucriferous
experiments, too, in philosophy. 10. The prices of diet and other
things. 11. And the staple commodities of places.</p>

<p>"These generals (such as at present I could think of), if they will
serve for nothing else, yet they may assist you in drawing up a model
to regulate your travels by. As for particulars, these that follow are
all that I can now think of, viz.; whether at Schemnitium, in Hungary
(where there are mines of gold, copper, iron, vitriol, antimony,
&amp;c.), they change iron into copper by dissolving it in a vitriolate
water, which they find in cavities of rocks in the mines, and then
melting the slimy solution in a strong fire, which in the cooling
proves copper. The like is said to be done in other places, which I
cannot now remember; perhaps, too, it may be done in Italy. For about
twenty or thirty years agone there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span> a certain vitriol came from
thence (called Roman vitriol), but of a nobler virtue than that which
is now called by that name; which vitriol is not now to be gotten,
because, perhaps, they make a greater gain by some such trick as
turning iron into copper with it than by selling it. 2. Whether, in
Hungary, Sclavonia, Bohemia, near the town Eila, or at the mountains
of Bohemia near Silesia, there be rivers whose waters are impregnated
with gold; perhaps, the gold being dissolved by some corrosive water
like <i>aqua regis</i>, and the solution carried along with the stream,
that runs through the mines. And whether the practice of laying mercury
in the rivers, till it be tinged with gold, and then straining the
mercury through leather, that the gold may stay behind, be a secret
yet, or openly practised. 3. There is newly contrived, in Holland, a
mill to grind glasses plane withal, and I think polishing them too;
perhaps it will be worth the while to see it. 4. There is in Holland
one —— Borry, who some years since was imprisoned by the Pope, to
have extorted from him secrets (as I am told) of great worth, both as
to medicine and profit, but he escaped into Holland, where they have
granted him a guard. I think he usually goes clothed in green. Pray
inquire what you can of him, and whether his ingenuity be any profit to
the Dutch. You may inform yourself whether the Dutch have any tricks
to keep their ships from being all worm-eaten in their voyages to the
Indies. Whether pendulum clocks do any service in finding out the
longitude, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I am very weary, and shall not stay to part with a long compliment,
only I wish you a good journey, and God be with you."</p>

<p>It was not till the month of June, 1669, that our author made known
his Method of Fluxions. He then communicated the work which he had
composed upon the subject, and entitled, <span class="allsmcap">ANALYSIS PER EQUATIONES
NUMERO TERMINORUM INFINITAS</span>, to his friend Dr. Barrow. The latter, in
a letter dated 20th of the same month, mentioned it to Mr. Collins,
and transmitted it to him, on the 31st of July thereafter. Mr. Collins
greatly approved of the work; took a copy of it; and sent the original
back to Dr. Barrow. During the same and the two following years, Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Collins, by his extensive correspondence, spread the knowledge of
this discovery among the mathematicians in England, Scotland, France,
Holland and Italy.</p>

<p>Dr. Barrow, having resolved to devote himself to Theology, resigned the
Lucasian Professorship of Mathematics, in 1669, in favour of Newton,
who accordingly received the appointment to the vacant chair.</p>

<p>During the years 1669, 1670, and 1671, our author, as such Professor,
delivered a course of Optical Lectures. Though these contained his
principal discoveries relative to the different refrangibility of
light, yet the discoveries themselves did not become publicly known,
it seems, till he communicated them to the Royal Society, a few weeks
after being elected a member thereof, in the spring of 1671-2. He
now rose rapidly in reputation, and was soon regarded as foremost
among the philosophers of the age. His paper on light excited the
deepest interest in the Royal Society, who manifested an anxious
solicitude to secure the author from the "arrogations of others," and
proposed to publish his discourse in the monthly numbers in which the
Transactions were given to the world. Newton, gratefully sensible
of these expressions of esteem, willingly accepted of the proposal
for publication. He gave them also, at this time, the results of
some further experiments in the decomposition and re-composition of
light:—that the same degree of refrangibility always belonged to the
same colour, and the same colour to the same degree of refrangibility:
that the seven different colours of the spectrum were original, or
simple, and that <i>whiteness</i>, or white light was a compound of all
these seven colours.</p>

<p>The publication of his new doctrines on light soon called forth violent
opposition as to their soundness. Hooke and Huygens—men eminent for
ability and learning—were the most conspicuous of the assailants. And
though Newton effectually silenced all his adversaries, yet he felt the
triumph of little gain in comparison with the loss his tranquillity
had sustained. He subsequently remarked in allusion to this
controversy—and to one with whom he was destined to have a longer and
a bitterer conflict—"I was so persecuted with discussions arising from
the publication of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span> theory of light, that I blamed my own imprudence
for parting with so substantial a blessing as my quiet to run after a
shadow."</p>

<p>In a communication to Mr. Oldenburg, Secretary of the Royal Society,
in 1672, our author stated many valuable suggestions relative to the
construction of <span class="allsmcap">REFLECTING MICROSCOPES</span> which he considered even more
capable of improvement than telescopes. He also contemplated, about
the same time, an edition of Kinckhuysen's Algebra, with notes and
additions; partially arranging, as an introduction to the work, a
treatise, entitled, A Method of Fluxions; but he finally abandoned the
design. This treatise, however, he resolved, or rather consented, at a
late period of his life, to put forth separately; and the plan would
probably have been carried into execution had not his death intervened.
It was translated into English, and published in 1736 by John Colson,
Professor of Mathematics in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Newton, it is thought, made his discoveries concerning the <span class="allsmcap">INFLECTION</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">DIFFRACTION</span> of light before 1674. The phenomena of the inflection
of light had been first discovered more than ten years before by
Grimaldi. And Newton began by repeating one of the experiments of the
learned Jesuit—admitting a beam of the sun's light through a small
pin hole into a dark chamber: the light diverged from the aperture in
the form of a cone, and the shadows of all bodies placed in this light
were larger than might have been expected, and surrounded with three
coloured fringes, the nearest being widest, and the most remote the
narrowest. Newton, advancing upon this experiment, took exact measures
of the diameter of the shadow of a human hair, and of the breadth of
the fringes, at different distances behind it, and discovered that
these diameters and breadths were not proportional to the distances
at which they were measured. He hence supposed that the rays which
passed by the edge of the hair were deflected or turned aside from
it, as if by a repulsive force, the nearest rays suffering the
greatest, the more remote a less degree of deflection. In explanation
of the coloured fringes, he queried: whether the rays which differ in
refrangibility do not differ also in flexibility, and whether they are
not, by these different inflections, separated from one another, so
as after separation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span> to make the colours in the three fringes above
described? Also, whether the rays, in passing by the edges and sides
of bodies, are not bent several times backwards and forwards with an
eel-like motion—the three fringes arising from three such bendings?
His inquiries on this subject were here interrupted and never renewed.</p>

<p>His Theory of the <span class="allsmcap">COLOURS</span> of 
<span class="allsmcap">NATURAL BODIES</span> was communicated to the Royal
Society, in February, 1675. This is justly regarded as one of the
profoundest of his speculations. The fundamental principles of the
Theory in brief, are:—That bodies possessing the greatest refractive
powers reflect the greatest quantity of light; and that, at the
confines of equally refracting media, there is no reflection. That the
minutest particles of almost all natural bodies are in some degree
transparent. That between the particles of bodies there are pores,
or spaces, either empty or filled with media of a less density than
the particles themselves. That these particles, and pores or spaces,
have some definite size. Hence he deduced the Transparency, Opacity,
and colours of natural bodies. Transparency arises from the particles
and their pores being too small to cause reflection at their common
surfaces—the light all passing through; Opacity from the opposite
cause of the particles and their pores being sufficiently large to
reflect the light which is "stopped or stifled" by the multitude
of reflections; and colours from the particles, according to their
several sizes, reflecting rays of one colour and transmitting those of
another—or in other words, the colour that meets the eye is the colour
reflected, while all the other rays are transmitted or absorbed.</p>

<p>Analogous in origin to the colours of natural bodies, he considered
the <span class="allsmcap">COLOURS OF THIN PLATES</span>. This
subject was interesting and important, and had attracted considerable
investigation. He, however, was the first to determine the law of the
production of these colours, and, during the same year made known
the results of his researches herein to the Royal Society. His mode
of procedure in these experiments was simple and curious. He placed
a double convex lens of a large known radius of curvature, upon
the flat surface of a plano-convex object glass. Thus, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span> 
their point of contact at the centre, to the circumference of the
lens, he obtained plates of air, or spaces varying from the extremest
possible thinness, by slow degrees, to a considerable thickness.
Letting the light fall, every different thickness of this plate of
air gave different colours—the point of contact of the lens and glass
forming the centre of numerous concentric colored rings. Now the radius
of curvature of the lens being known, the thickness of the plate of
air, at any given point, or where any particular colour appeared,
could be exactly determined. Carefully noting, therefore, the order
in which the different colours appeared, he measured, with the nicest
accuracy, the different thicknesses at which the most luminous parts
of the rings were produced, whether the medium were air, water,
or mica—all these substances giving the same colours at different
thicknesses;—the ratio of which he also ascertained. From the phenomena
observed in these experiments, Newton deduced his Theory of Fits of
<span class="allsmcap">EASY REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION</span> of
light. It consists in supposing that every particle of light, from its
first discharge from a luminous body, possesses, at equally distant
intervals, dispositions to be reflected from, or transmitted through
the surfaces of bodies upon which it may fall. For instance, if the
rays are in a Fit of Easy Reflection, they are on reaching the surface,
repelled, thrown off, or reflected from it; if, in a Fit of Easy
Transmission, they are attracted, drawn in, or transmitted through it.
By this Theory of Fits, our author likewise explained the colours of
thick plates.</p>

<p>He regarded light as consisting of small material particles emitted
from shining substances. He thought that these particles could be
re-combined into solid matter, so that "gross bodies and light were
convertible into one another;" that the particles of light and the
particles of solid bodies acted mutually upon each other; those of
light agitating and heating those of solid bodies, and the latter
attracting and repelling the former. Newton was The first to suggest
the idea of the <span class="allsmcap">POLARIZATION</span> of light.</p>

<p>In the paper entitled <i>An Hypothesis Explaining Properties of
Light</i>, December, 1675, our author first introduced his opinions
respecting Ether—opinions which he afterward abandoned and again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
permanently resumed—"A most subtle spirit which pervades" all bodies,
and is expanded through all the heavens. It is electric, and almost,
if not quite immeasurably elastic and rare. "By the force and action
of which spirit the particles of bodies mutually attract one another,
at near distances, and cohere, if contiguous; and electric bodies
operate at greater distances, as well repelling as attracting the
neighbouring corpuscles; and light is emitted, reflected, refracted,
inflected and heats bodies; and all sensation is excited, and the
members of animal bodies move at the command of the will, namely, by
the vibrations of this spirit, mutually propagated along the solid
filaments of the nerves, from the outward organs of sense to the brain,
and from the brain into the muscles." This "spirit" was no <i>anima
mundi</i>; nothing further from the thought of Newton; but was it not,
on his part, a partial recognition of, or attempt to reach an ultimate
material force, or primary element, by means of which, "in the roaring
loom of time," this material universe, God's visible garment, may be
woven for us?</p>

<p>The Royal Society were greatly interested in the results of some
experiments, which our author had, at the same time, communicated to
them relative to the excitation of electricity in glass; and they,
after several attempts and further direction from him, succeeded in
re-producing the same phenomena.</p>

<p>One of the most curious of Newton's minor inquiries related to the
connexion between the refractive powers and chemical composition
of bodies. He found on comparing the refractive powers and the
densities of many different substances, that the former were very
nearly proportional to the latter, in the same bodies. Unctuous and
sulphureous bodies were noticed as remarkable exceptions—as well
as the <i>diamond</i>—their refractive powers being two or three
times greater in respect of their densities than in the case of
other substances, while, as among themselves, the one was generally
proportional to the other. He hence inferred as to the diamond a great
degree of combustibility;—a conjecture which the experiments of modern
chemistry have shown to be true.</p>

<p>The chemical researches of our author were probably pursued with
more or less diligence from the time of his witnessing some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> of the
practical operations in that science at the Apothecary's at Grantham.
<span class="allsmcap">DE NATURA ACIDORUM</span> is a short chemical paper, on various topics, and
published in Dr. Horsley's Edition of his works. <span class="allsmcap">TABULA QUANTITATUM
ET GRADUUM COLORIS</span> was inserted in the Philosophical Transactions;
it contains a comparative scale of temperature from that of melting
ice to that of a small kitchen coal-fire. He regarded fire as a body
heated so hot as to emit light copiously; and flame as a vapour, fume,
or exhalation heated so hot as to shine. To elective attraction, by
the operation of which the small particles of bodies, as he conceived,
act upon one another, at distances so minute as to escape observation,
he ascribed all the various chemical phenomena of precipitation,
combination, solution, and crystallization, and the mechanical
phenomena of cohesion and capillary attraction. Newton's chemical
views were illustrated and confirmed, in part, at least, in his own
life-time. As to the structure of bodies, he was of opinion "that the
smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest attractions,
and compose bigger particles of weaker virtue; and many of these may
cohere and compose bigger particles whose virtue is still weaker;
and so on for divers successions, until the progression end in the
biggest particles, on which the operations in chemistry and the colours
of natural bodies depend, and which by adhering, compose bodies of
sensible magnitude."</p>

<p>There is good reason to suppose that our author was a diligent student
of the writings of Jacob Behmen; and that in conjunction with a
relative, Dr. Newton, he was busily engaged, for several months in
the earlier part of life, in quest of the philosopher's tincture.
"Great Alchymist," however, very imperfectly describes the character
of Behmen, whose researches into things material and things spiritual,
things human and things divine, afford the strongest evidence of a
great and original mind.</p>

<p>More appropriately here, perhaps, than elsewhere, may be given Newton's
account of some curious experiments, made in his own person, on the
action of light upon the retina. Locke, who was an intimate friend of
our author, wrote to him for his opinion on a certain fact stated in
Boyle's Book of Colours. Newton, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span> his reply, dated June 30th, 1691,
narrates the following circumstances, which probably took place in the
course of his optical researches. Thus:—</p>

<p>"The observation you mention in Mr. Boyle's Book of Colours I once
tried upon myself with the hazard of my eyes. The manner was this; I
looked a very little while upon the sun in the looking-glass with my
right eye, and then turned my eyes into a dark corner of my chamber,
and winked, to observe the impression made, and the circles of colours
which encompassed it, and how they decayed by degrees, and at last
vanished. This I repeated a second and a third time. At the third time,
when the phantasm of light and colours about it were almost vanished,
intending my fancy upon them to see their last appearance, I found, to
my amazement, that they began to return, and by little and little to
become as lively and vivid as when I had newly looked upon the sun. But
when I ceased to intend my fancy upon them, they vanished again. After
this, I found, that as often as I went into the dark, and intended my
mind upon them, as when a man looks earnestly to see anything which
is difficult to be seen, I could make the phantasm return without
looking any more upon the sun; and the oftener I made it return, the
more easily I could make it return again. And, at length, by repeating
this, without looking any more upon the sun, I made such an impression
on my eye, that, if I looked upon the clouds, or a book, or any bright
object, I saw upon it a round bright spot of light like the sun, and,
which is still stranger, though I looked upon the sun with my right eye
only, and not with my left, yet my fancy began to make an impression
upon my left eye, as well us upon my right. For if I shut my right
eye, or looked upon a book, or the clouds, with my left eye, I could
see the spectrum of the sun almost as plain as with my right eye, if
I did but intend my fancy a little while upon it; for at first, if I
shut my right eye, and looked with my left, the spectrum of the sun did
not appear till I intended my fancy upon it; but by repeating, this
appeared every time more easily. And now, in a few hours' time, I had
brought my eyes to such a pass, that I could look upon no bright object
with either eye, but I saw the sun before me, so that I durst neither
write<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span> nor read; but to recover the use of my eyes, shut myself up
in my chamber made dark, for three days together, and used all means
to divert my imagination from the sun. For if I thought upon him, I
presently saw his picture, though I was in the dark. But by keeping in
the dark, and employing my mind about other things, I began in three
or four days to have some use of my eyes again; and by forbearing to
look upon bright objects, recovered them pretty well, though not so
well but that, for some months after, the spectrum of the sun began
to return as often as I began to meditate upon the phenomena, even
though I lay in bed at midnight with my curtains drawn. But now I have
been very well for many years, though I am apt to think, if I durst
venture my eyes, I could still make the phantasm return by the power
of my fancy. This story I tell you, to let you understand, that in the
observation related by Mr. Boyle, the man's fancy probably concurred
with the impression made by the sun's light to produce that phantasm of
the sun which he constantly saw in bright objects. And so your question
about the cause of phantasm involves another about the power of fancy,
which I must confess is too hard a knot for me to untie. To place this
effect in a constant motion is hard, because the sun ought then to
appear perpetually. It seems rather to consist in a disposition of the
sensorium to move the imagination strongly, and to be easily moved,
both by the imagination and by the light, as often as bright objects
are looked upon."</p>

<p>Though Newton had continued silent, yet his thoughts were by no means
inactive upon the vast subject of the planetary motions. The idea of
Universal Gravitation, first caught sight of, so to speak, in the
garden at Woolsthorpe, years ago, had gradually expanded upon him. We
find him, in a letter to Dr. Hooke, Secretary of the Royal Society,
dated in November, 1679, proposing to verify the motion of the earth by
direct experiment, namely, by the observation of the path pursued by a
body falling from a considerable height. He had concluded that the path
would be spiral; but Dr. Hooke maintained that it would be an eccentric
ellipse in vacuo, and an elliptic-spiral in a resisting medium. Our
author, aided by this correction of his error, and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span> the discovery
that a projectile would move in an elliptical orbit when under the
influence of a force varying inversely as the square of the distance,
was led to discover "the theorem by which he afterwards examined the
ellipsis;" and to demonstrate the celebrated proposition that a planet
acted upon by an attractive force varying inversely as the squares of
the distances will describe an elliptical orbit, in one of whose foci
the attractive force resides.</p>

<p>When he was attending a meeting of the Royal Society, in June 1682,
the conversation fell upon the subject of the measurement of a degree
of the meridian, executed by M. Picard, a French Astronomer, in 1679.
Newton took a memorandum of the result; and afterward, at the earliest
opportunity, computed from it the diameter of the earth: furnished with
these new data, he resumed his calculation of 1666. As he proceeded
therein, he saw that his early expectations were now likely to be
realized; the thick rushing, stupendous results overpowered him; he
became unable to carry on the process of calculation, and intrusted its
completion to one of his friends. The discoverer had, indeed, grasped
the master-fact. The law of falling bodies at the earth's surface was
at length identified with that which guided the moon in her orbit.
And so his <span class="allsmcap">GREAT THOUGHT</span>, that had for sixteen years loomed up in
dim, gigantic outline, amid the first dawn of a plausible hypothesis,
now stood forth, radiant and not less grand, in the mid-day light of
demonstrated truth.</p>

<p>It were difficult, nay impossible to imagine, even, the influence of a
result like this upon a mind like Newton's. It was as if the keystone
had been fitted to the glorious arch by which his spirit should ascend
to the outskirts of infinite space—spanning the immeasurable—weighing
the imponderable—computing the incalculable—mapping out the marchings
of the planets, and the far-wanderings of the comets, and catching,
bring back to earth some clearer notes of that higher melody which, as
a sounding voice, bears perpetual witness to the design and omnipotence
of a creating Deity.</p>

<p>Newton, extending the law thus obtained, composed a series of about
twelve propositions on the motion of the primary planets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span> about the
sun. These were sent to London, and communicated to the Royal Society
about the end of 1683. At or near this period, other philosophers,
as Sir Christopher Wren, Dr. Halley, and Dr. Hooke, were engaged in
investigating the same subject; but with no definite or satisfactory
results. Dr. Halley, having seen, it is presumed, our author's
propositions, went in August, 1684, to Cambridge to consult with
him upon the subject. Newton assured him that he had brought the
demonstration to perfection. In November, Dr. Halley received a
copy of the work; and, in the following month, announced it to the
Royal Society, with the author's promise to have it entered upon
their Register. Newton, subsequently reminded by the Society of his
promise, proceeded in the diligent preparation of the work, and, though
suffering an interruption of six weeks, transmitted the manuscript
of the first book to London before the end of April. The work was
entitled <span class="allsmcap">PHILOSOPHIÆ NATURALIS PRINCIPIA MATHEMATICA</span>, dedicated to the
Royal Society, and presented thereto on the 28th of April, 1685-6.
The highest encomiums were passed upon it; and the council resolved,
on the 19th of May, to print it at the expense of the Society, and
under the direction of Dr. Halley. The latter, a few days afterward,
communicated these steps to Newton, who, in a reply, dated the 20th
of June, holds the following language:—"The proof you sent me I like
very well. I designed the whole to consist of three books; the second
was finished last summer, being short, and only wants transcribing, and
drawing the cuts fairly. Some new propositions I have since thought on,
which I can as well let alone. The third wants the theory of comets. In
autumn last, I spent two months in calculation to no purpose for want
of a good method, which made me afterward return to the first book,
and enlarge it with diverse propositions, some relating to comets,
others to other things found out last winter. The third I now design
to suppress. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that
a man had as good be engaged in law-suits as have to do with her. I
found it so formerly, and now I can no sooner come near her again,
but she gives me warning. The first two books without the third will
not so well bear the title of <i>Philosophiæ Naturalis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span> Principia
Mathematica</i>; and thereupon I had altered it to this, <i>De Motu
Corporum Libri duo</i>. But after second thought I retain the former
title. It will help the sale of the book, which I ought not to diminish
now 'tis yours."</p>

<p>This "warning" arose from some pretensions put forth by Dr. Hooke. And
though Newton gave a minute and positive refutations of such claims,
yet, to reconcile all differences, he generously added to Prop. IV.
Cor. 6, Book I., a Scholium, in which Wren, Hooke and Halley are
acknowledged to have independently deduced the law of gravity from the
second law of Kepler.</p>

<p>The suppression of the third book Dr. Halley could not endure to see.
"I must again beg you" says he, "not to let your resentments run so
high as to deprive us of your third book, wherein your applications of
your mathematical doctrine to the theory of comets, and several curious
experiments, which, as I guess by what you write ought to compose it,
will undoubtedly render it acceptable to those who will call themselves
philosophers without mathematics, which are much the greater number."
To these solicitations Newton yielded. There were no "resentments,"
however, as we conceive, in his "design to suppress." He sought peace;
for he loved and valued it above all applause. But, in spite of his
efforts for tranquillity's sake, his course of discovery was all along
molested by ignorance or presumptuous rivalry.</p>

<p>The publication of the great work now went rapidly forwards. The second
book was sent to the Society, and presented on the 2d March; the
third, on the 6th April; and the whole was completed and published in
the month of May, 1686-7. In the second Lemma of the second book, the
fundamental principle of his fluxionary calculus was, for the first
time, given to the world; but its algorithm or notation did not appear
till published in the second volume of Dr. Wallis's works, in 1693.</p>

<p>And thus was ushered into existence The <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>—a work to which
pre-eminence above all the productions of the human intellect has been
awarded—a work that must be esteemed of priceless worth so long as
Science has a votary, or a single worshipper be left to kneel at the
altar of Truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The entire work bears the general title of <span class="allsmcap">THE MATHEMATICAL PRINCIPLES
OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY</span>. It consists of three books: the first two,
entitled, <span class="allsmcap">OF THE MOTION OF BODIES</span>, are occupied with the laws and
conditions of motions and forces, and are illustrated with many scholia
treating of some of the most general and best established points in
philosophy, such as the density and resistance of bodies, spaces void
of matter, and the motion of sound and light. From these principles,
there is deduced, in the third book, drawn up in as popular a style as
possible and entitled, <span class="allsmcap">OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD</span>, the constitution of
the system of the world. In regard to this book, the author says—"I
had, indeed, composed the third Book in a popular method, that it
might be read by many; but afterwards, considering that such as had
not sufficiently entered into the principles could not easily discover
the strength of the consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to
which they had been many years accustomed, therefore, to prevent
disputes which might be raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce
the substance of this Book into the form of Propositions (in the
mathematical way), which should be read by those only who had first
made themselves masters of the principles established in the preceding
Books: not that I would advise any one to the previous study of every
Proposition of those Books."—"It is enough if one carefully reads
the Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the three first Sections of
the first Book. He may then pass on to this Book, and consult such of
the remaining Propositions of the first two Books, as the references
in this, and his occasions shall require." So that "The System of the
World" is composed both "in a popular method," and in the form of
mathematical Propositions.</p>

<p>The principle of Universal Gravitation, namely, <i>that every particle
of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to, every other particle of
matter, with a force inversely proportional to the squares of their
distances</i>—is the discovery which characterizes <span class="allsmcap">THE PRINCIPIA</span>.
This principle the author deduced from the motion of the moon, and the
three laws of Kepler—laws, which Newton, in turn, by his greater law,
demonstrated to be true.</p>

<p>From the first law of Kepler, namely, the proportionality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> the areas
to the times of their description, our author inferred that the force
which retained the planet in its orbit was always directed to the sun;
and from the second, namely, that every planet moves in an ellipse with
the sun in one of its foci, he drew the more general inference that the
force by which the planet moves round that focus varies inversely as
the square of its distance therefrom: and he demonstrated that a planet
acted upon by such a force could not move in any other curve than a
conic section; showing when the moving body would describe a circular,
an elliptical, a parabolic, or hyperbolic orbit. He demonstrated, too,
that this force, or attracting, gravitating power resided in every,
the least particle; but that, in spherical masses, it operated as
if confined to their centres; so that, one sphere or body will act
upon another sphere or body, with a force directly proportional to
the quantity of matter, and inversely as the square of the distance
between their centres; and that their velocities of mutual approach
will be in the inverse ratio of their quantities of matter. Thus he
grandly outlined the Universal Law. Verifying its truth by the motions
of terrestrial bodies, then by those of the moon and other secondary
orbs, he finally embraced, in one mighty generalization, the entire
Solar System—all the movements of all its bodies—planets, satellites
and comets—explaining and harmonizing the many diverse and theretofore
inexplicable phenomena.</p>

<p>Guided by the genius of Newton, we see sphere bound to sphere, body
to body, particle to particle, atom to mass, the minutest part to the
stupendous whole—each to each, each to all, and all to each—in the
mysterious bonds of a ceaseless, reciprocal influence. An influence
whose workings are shown to be alike present in the globular dew-drop,
or oblate-spheroidal earth; in the falling shower, or vast heaving
ocean tides; in the flying thistle-down, or fixed, ponderous rock;
in the swinging pendulum, or time-measuring sun; in the varying and
unequal moon, or earth's slowly retrograding poles; in the uncertain
meteor, or blazing comet wheeling swiftly away on its remote, yet
determined round. An influence, in fine, that may link system to system
through all the star-glowing firmament; then firmament to firmament;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
aye, firmament to firmament, again and again, till, converging home, it
may be, to some ineffable centre, where more presently dwells He who
inhabiteth immensity, and where infinitudes meet and eternities have
their conflux, and where around move, in softest, swiftest measure, all
the countless hosts that crowd heaven's fathomless deeps.</p>

<p>And yet Newton, amid the loveliness and magnitude of Omnipotence,
lost not sight of the Almighty One. A secondary, however universal,
was not taken for the First Cause. An impressed force, however
diffused and powerful, assumed not the functions of the creating,
giving Energy. Material beauties, splendours, and sublimities, however
rich in glory, and endless in extent, concealed not the attributes
of an intelligent Supreme. From the depths of his own soul, through
reason and the <span class="allsmcap">WORD</span>, he had risen, <i>à
priori</i>, to God: from the heights of Omnipotence, through the design
and law of the builded universe, he proved <i>à posteriori</i>, a
Deity. "I had," says he, "an eye upon such principles as might work,
with considering men, for the belief of a Deity," in writing the
<span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>; at the conclusion whereof,
he teaches that—"this most beautiful system of the sun, planets
and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an
intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the centres
of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise counsels,
must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since the light
of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of the sun, and
from every system light passes into all other systems: and lest the
systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity, fall on each other
mutually, he hath placed those systems at immense distances one from
another.</p>

<p>"This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as
Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called
Lord God παντοκρατωρ or Universal Ruler; for God is a relative word,
and has a respect to servants; and Deity is the dominion of God, not
over his own body, as those imagine who fancy God to be the soul of
the world, but over servants. The Supreme God is a Being eternal,
infinite, absolutely perfect; but a being, however perfect, without
dominion, cannot be said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span> be Lord God; for we say, my God, your
God, the God of Israel, the God of Gods, and Lord of Lords; but we do
not say, my Eternal, your Eternal, the Eternal of Israel, the Eternal
of Gods; we do not say my Infinite, or my Perfect: these are titles
which have no respect to servants. The word God usually signifies
Lord; but every Lord is not God. It is the dominion of a spiritual
Being which constitutes a God; a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion
makes a true, supreme, or imaginary God. And from his true dominion
it follows that the true God is a living, intelligent and powerful
Being; and from his other perfections, that he is supreme or most
perfect. He is eternal and infinite, omnipotent and omniscient; that
is, his duration reaches from eternity to eternity; his presence from
infinity to infinity; he governs all things and knows all things, that
are or can be done. He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and
infinite; he is not duration and space, but he endures and is present.
He endures forever and is everywhere present; and by existing always
and everywhere, he constitutes duration and space. Since every particle
of space is <i>always</i>, and every indivisible moment of duration is
<i>everywhere</i>, certainly the Maker and Lord of things cannot be
<i>never</i> and <i>nowhere</i>. Every soul that has perception is,
though in different times and different organs of sense and motion,
still the same indivisible person. There are given successive parts
in duration, co-existent parts in space, but neither the one nor the
other in the person of a man, or his thinking principle; and much
less can they be found in the thinking substance of God. Every man,
so far as he is a thing that has perception, is one and the same man
during his whole life, in all and each of his organs of sense. God
is one and the same God, always and everywhere. He is omnipresent,
not <i>virtually</i> only, but also <i>substantially</i>; for virtue
cannot subsist without substance. In him are all things contained and
moved; yet neither affects the other; God suffers nothing from the
motion of bodies; bodies find no resistance from the omnipresence of
God. It is allowed by all that the Supreme God exists necessarily; and
by the same necessity he exists <i>always</i> and <i>everywhere</i>.
Whence also he is all similar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm,
all power<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span> to perceive, to understand, and to act; but in a manner not
at all human, in a manner not at all corporeal, in a manner utterly
unknown to us. As a blind man has no idea of colours, so have we no
idea of the manner by which the all-wise God perceives and understands
all things. He is utterly void of all body, and bodily figure, and can
therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched: nor ought he to be
worshipped under the representation of any corporeal thing. We have
ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of anything is we
know not. In bodies we see only their figures and colours, we hear only
the sounds, we touch only their outward surfaces, we smell only the
smells, and taste only the savours; but their inward substances are not
to be known, either by our senses, or by any reflex act of our minds:
much less, then, have we any idea of the substance of God. We know him
only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final
causes; we admire him for his perfections; but we reverence and adore
him on account of his dominion; for we adore him as his servants; and
a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else
but Fate and Nature. Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly
the same always and everywhere, could produce no variety of things.
All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different
times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of a
Being necessarily existing."</p>

<p>Thus, the diligent student of science, the earnest seeker of truth,
led, as through the courts of a sacred Temple, wherein, at each step,
new wonders meet the eye, till, as a crowning grace, they stand before
a Holy of Holies, and learn that all science and all truth are one
which hath its beginning and its end in the knowledge of Him whose
glory the heavens declare, and whose handiwork the firmament showeth
forth.</p>

<p>The introduction of the pure and lofty doctrines of the 
<span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> was perseveringly resisted.
Descartes, with his system of vortices, had sown plausibly to
the imagination, and error had struck down deeply, and shot up
luxuriantly, not only in the popular, but in the scientific mind.
Besides the idea—in itself so simple and so grand—that the great
masses of the planets were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg
38]</span> suspended in empty space, and retained in their orbits by
an invisible influence residing in the sun—was to the ignorant a thing
inconceivable, and to the learned a revival of the occult qualities of
the ancient physics. This remark applies particularly to the continent.
Leibnitz misapprehended; Huygens in part rejected; John Bernoulli
opposed; and Fontenelle never received the doctrines of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>. So that, the saying of Voltaire is
probably true, that though Newton survived the publication of his great
work more than forty years, yet, at the time of his death, he had not
above twenty followers out of England.</p>

<p>But in England, the reception of our author's philosophy was
rapid and triumphant. His own labours, while Lucasian Professor;
those of his successors in that Chair—Whiston and Saunderson; those
of Dr. Samuel Clarke, Dr. Laughton, Roger Cotes, and Dr. Bentley;
the experimental lectures of Dr. Keill and Desaguliers; the early
and powerful exertions of David Gregory at Edinburgh, and of his
brother James Gregory at St. Andrew's, tended to diffuse widely in
England and Scotland a knowledge of, and taste for the truths of the
<span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>. Indeed, its mathematical
doctrines constituted, from the first, a regular part of academical
instruction; while its physical truths, given to the public in
popular lectures, illustrated by experiments, had, before the lapse
of twenty years, become familiar to, and adopted by the general mind.
Pemberton's popular "View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy" was
published, in 1728; and the year afterward, an English translation
of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>, and System of the
World, by Andrew Motte. And since that period, the labours of Le
Seur and Jacquier, of Thorpe, of Jebb, of Wright and others have
greatly contributed to display the most hidden treasures of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>.</p>

<p>About the time of the publication of the Principia, James II., bent
on re-establishing the Romish Faith, had, among other illegal acts,
ordered by mandamus, the University of Cambridge to confer the degree
of Master of Arts upon an ignorant monk. Obedience to this mandate was
resolutely refused. Newton was one of the nine delegates chosen to
defend the independence of the University. They appeared before the
High Court;—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span> successfully: the king abandoned his design. The
prominent part which our author took in these proceedings, and his
eminence in the scientific world, induced his proposal as one of the
parliamentary representatives of the University. He was elected, in
1688, and sat in the Convention Parliament till its dissolution. After
the first year, however, he seems to have given little or no attention
to his parliamentary duties, being seldom absent from the University
till his appointment in the Mint, in 1695.</p>

<p>Newton began his theological researches sometime previous to 1691; in
the prime of his years, and in the matured vigour of his intellectual
powers. From his youth, as we have seen, he had devoted himself with
an activity the most unceasing, and an energy almost superhuman to the
discovery of physical truth;—giving to Philosophy a new foundation,
and to Science a new temple. To pass on, then, from the consideration
of the material, more directly to that of the spiritual, was a natural,
nay, with so large and devout a soul, a necessary advance. The Bible
was to him of inestimable worth. In the elastic freedom, which a pure
and unswerving faith in Him of Nazareth gives, his mighty faculties
enjoyed the only completest scope for development. His original
endowment, however great, combined with a studious application, however
profound, would never, without this liberation from the dominion
of passion and sense, have enabled him to attain to that wondrous
concentration and grasp of intellect, for which Fame has as yet
assigned him no equal. Gratefully he owned, therefore, the same Author
in the Book of Nature and the Book of Revelation. These were to him
as drops of the same unfathomable ocean;—as outrayings of the same
inner splendour;—as tones of the same ineffable voice;—as segments of
the same infinite curve. With great joy he had found himself enabled
to proclaim, as an interpreter, from the hieroglyphs of Creation, the
existence of a God: and now, with greater joy, and in the fulness of
his knowledge, and in the fulness of his strength, he laboured to make
clear, from the utterances of the inspired Word, the far mightier
confirmations of a Supreme Good, in all its glorious amplitude of Being
and of Attribute; and to bring the infallible workings thereof plainly
home to the understandings and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span> affections of his fellow-men;
and finally to add the weight of his own testimony in favour of that
Religion, whose truth is now, indeed, "girded with the iron and the
rock of a ponderous and colossal demonstration."</p>

<p>His work, entitled, <span class="allsmcap">OBSERVATIONS UPON THE PROPHECIES OF HOLY WRIT,
PARTICULARLY THE PROPHECIES OF DANIEL AND THE APOCALYPSE OF ST. JOHN</span>,
first published in London, in 1733 4to. consists of two parts: the one
devoted to the Prophecies of Daniel, and the other to the Apocalypse
of St. John. In the first part, he treats concerning the compilers of
the books of the Old Testament;—of the prophetic language;—of the
vision of the four beasts;—of the kingdoms represented by the feet of
the image composed of iron and clay;—of the ten kingdoms represented
by the ten horns of the beast;—of the eleventh horn of Daniel's
fourth beast; of the power which should change times and laws;—of
the kingdoms represented in Daniel by the ram and he-goat;—of the
prophecy of the seventy weeks;—of the times of the birth and passion
of Christ;—of the prophecy of the Scripture of Truth;—of the king who
doeth according to his will, and magnified himself above every god,
and honoured Mahuzzims, and regarded not the desire of women;—of the
Mahuzzim, honoured by the king who doeth according to his will. In the
second part, he treats of the time when the Apocalypse was written,
of the scene of the vision, and the relation which the Apocalypse has
to the book of the law of Moses, and to the worship of God in the
temple;—of the relation which the Apocalypse has to the prophecies
of Daniel, and of the subject of the prophecy itself. Newton regards
the prophecies as given, not for the gratification of man's curiosity,
by enabling him to foreknow; but for his conviction that the world
is governed by Providence, by witnessing their fulfilment. Enough of
prophecy, he thinks, has already been fulfilled to afford the diligent
seeker abundant evidence of God's providence. The whole work is marked
by profound erudition, sagacity and argument.</p>

<p>And not less learning, penetration and masterly reasoning are
conspicuous in his <span class="allsmcap">HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF TWO NOTABLE CORRUPTIONS OF
SCRIPTURES IN A LETTER TO A FRIEND</span>. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span> Treatise, first accurately
published in Dr. Horsley's edition of his works, relates to two texts:
the one, 1 Epistle of St. John v. 7; the other, 1 Epistle of St.
Paul to Timothy iii. 16. As this work had the effect to deprive the
advocates of the doctrine of the Trinity of two leading texts, Newton
has been looked upon as an Arian; but there is absolutely nothing in
his writings to warrant such a conclusion.</p>

<p>His remaining theological works consist of the <span class="allsmcap">LEXICON PROPHETICUM</span>,
which was left incomplete; a Latin Dissertation on the sacred cubit
of the Jews, which was translated into English, and published, in
1737, among the Miscellaneous Works of John Greaves; and <span class="allsmcap">FOUR LETTERS</span>
<i>addressed to Dr. Bentley, containing some arguments in proof of a
Deity</i>. These Letters were dated respectively: 10th December, 1692;
17th January, 1693; 25th February, 1693; and 11th February, 1693—the
fourth bearing an earlier date than the third. The best faculties and
the profoundest acquirements of our author are convincingly manifest in
these lucid and powerful compositions. They were published in 1756, and
reviewed by Dr. Samuel Johnson.</p>

<p>Newton's religious writings are distinguished by their absolute
freedom from prejudice. Everywhere, throughout them, there glows the
genuine nobleness of soul. To his whole life, indeed, we may here
fitly extend the same observation. He was most richly imbued with
the very spirit of the Scriptures which he so delighted to study
and to meditate upon. His was a piety, so fervent, so sincere and
practical, that it rose up like a holy incense from every thought and
act. His a benevolence that not only willed, but endeavoured the best
for all. His a philanthropy that held in the embracings of its love
every brother-man. His a toleration of the largest and the truest;
condemning persecution in every, even its mildest form; and kindly
encouraging each striving after excellence:—a toleration that came
not of indifference—for the immoral and the impious met with their
quick rebuke—but a toleration that came of the wise humbleness and
the Christian charity, which see, in the nothingness of self and the
almightiness of <span class="allsmcap">TRUTH</span>, no praise for the
ablest, and no blame for the feeblest in their strugglings upward to
light and life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>In the winter of 1691-2, on returning from chapel, one morning, Newton
found that a favourite little dog, called Diamond, had overturned a
lighted taper on his desk, and that several papers containing the
results of certain optical experiments, were nearly consumed. His only
exclamation, on perceiving his loss, was, "Oh Diamond, Diamond, little
knowest thou the mischief thou hast done." Dr. Brewster, in his life
of our author, gives the following extract from the manuscript Diary
of Mr. Abraham De La Pryme, a student in the University at the time of
this occurrence.</p>

<p>"1692. February, 3.—What I heard to-day I must relate. There is one
Mr. Newton (whom I have very oft seen), Fellow of Trinity College,
that is mighty famous for his learning, being a most excellent
mathematician, philosopher, divine, &amp;c. He has been Fellow of the
Royal Society these many years; and among other very learned books
and tracts, he's written one upon the mathematical principles of
philosophy, which has given him a mighty name, he having received,
especially from Scotland, abundance of congratulatory letters for the
same; but of all the books he ever wrote, there was one of colours
and light, established upon thousands of experiments which he had
been twenty years of making, and which had cost him many hundreds of
pounds. This book which he valued so much, and which was so much talked
of, had the ill luck to perish, and be utterly lost just when the
learned author was almost at putting a conclusion at the same, after
this manner: In a winter's morning, leaving it among his other papers
on his study table while he went to chapel, the candle, which he had
unfortunately left burning there, too, catched hold by some means of
other papers, and they fired the aforesaid book, and utterly consumed
it and several other valuable writings; and which is most wonderful
did no further mischief. But when Mr. Newton came from chapel, and had
seen what was done, every one thought he would have run mad, he was
so troubled thereat that he was not himself for a month after. A long
account of this his system of colours you may find in the Transactions
of the Royal Society, which he had sent up to them long before this sad
mischance happened unto him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that all of Newton's theological writings,
with the exception of the Letters to Dr. Bentley, were composed before
this event which, we must conclude, from Pryme's words, produced a
serious impression upon our author for about a month. But M. Biot,
in his Life of Newton, relying on a memorandum contained in a small
manuscript Journal of Huygens, declares this occurrence to have caused
a derangement of Newton's intellect. M. Biot's opinions and deductions,
however, as well as those of La Place, upon this subject, were based
upon erroneous data, and have been overthrown by the clearest proof.
There is not, in fact, the least evidence that Newton's reason was,
for a single moment, dethroned; on the contrary, the testimony is
conclusive that he was, at all times, perfectly capable of carrying
on his mathematical, metaphysical and astronomical inquiries. Loss of
sleep, loss of appetite, and irritated nerves will disturb somewhat the
equanimity of the most serene; and an act done, or language employed,
under such temporary discomposure, is not a just criterion of the
general tone and strength of a man's mind. As to the accident itself,
we may suppose, whatever might have been its precise nature, that it
greatly distressed him, and, still further, that its shock may have
originated the train of nervous derangements, which afflicted him,
more or less, for two years afterward. Yet, during this very period
of ill health, we find him putting forth his highest powers. In 1692,
he prepared for, and transmitted to Dr. Wallis the first proposition
of the Treatise on Quadratures, with examples of it in first, second
and third fluxions. He investigated, in the same year, the subject
of haloes; making and recording numerous and important observations
relative thereto. Those profound and beautiful Letters to Dr. Bentley
were written at the close of this and the beginning of the next year.
In October, 1693, Locke, who was then about publishing a second edition
of his work on the Human Understanding, requested Newton to reconsider
his opinions on innate ideas. And in 1694, he was zealously occupied
in perfecting his lunar theory; visiting Flamstead, at the Royal
Observatory of Greenwich, in September, and obtaining a series of lunar
observations; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span> commencing, in October, a correspondence with that
distinguished practical Astronomer, which continued till 1698.</p>

<p>We now arrive at the period when Newton permanently withdrew from
the seclusion of a collegiate, and entered upon a more active and
public life. He was appointed Warden of the Mint, in 1695, through
the influence of Charles Montague, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
and afterward Earl of Halifax. The current coin of the nation had
been adulterated and debased, and Montague undertook a re-coinage.
Our author's mathematical and chemical knowledge proved eminently
useful in accomplishing this difficult and most salutary reform. In
1699, he was promoted to the Mastership of the Mint—an office worth
twelve or fifteen hundred pounds per annum, and which he held during
the remainder of his life. He wrote, in this capacity, an official
Report on the Coinage, which has been published; he also prepared a
Table of Assays of Foreign Coins, which was printed at the end of Dr.
Arbuthnot's Tables of Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures, in 1727.</p>

<p>Newton retained his Professorship at Cambridge till 1703. But he had,
on receiving the appointment of Master of the Mint, in 1699, made Mr.
Whiston his deputy, with all the emoluments of the office; and, on
finally resigning, procured his nomination to the vacant Chair.</p>

<p>In January 1697, John Bernoulli proposed to the most distinguished
mathematicians of Europe two problems for solution. Leibnitz, admiring
the beauty of one of them, requested the time for solving it to be
extended to twelve months—twice the period originally named. The
delay was readily granted. Newton, however, sent in, the day after he
received the problems, a solution of them to the President of the Royal
Society. Bernoulli obtained solutions from Newton, Leibnitz and the
Marquis De L'Hopital; but Newton's though anonymous, he immediately
recognised "<i>tanquam ungue leonem</i>," as the lion is known by
his claw. We may mention here the famous problem of the trajectories
proposed by Leibnitz, in 1716, for the purpose of "feeling the pulse of
the English Analysts." Newton received the problem about five o'clock
in the afternoon, as he was returning from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span> Mint; and though it was
extremely difficult and he himself much fatigued, yet he completed its
solution, the same evening before he went to bed.</p>

<p>The history of these problems affords, by direct comparison, a striking
illustration of Newton's vast superiority of mind. That amazing
concentration and grasp of intellect, of which we have spoken, enabled
him to master speedily, and, as it were, by a single effort, those
things, for the achievement of which, the many would essay utterly
in vain, and the very, very few attain only after long and renewed
striving. And yet, with a modesty as unparalleled as his power, he
attributed his successes, not to any extraordinary sagacity, but solely
to industry and patient thought. He kept the subject of consideration
constantly before him, and waited till the first dawning opened
gradually into a full and clear light; never quitting, if possible,
the mental process till the object of it were wholly gained. He never
allowed this habit of meditation to appear in his intercourse with
society; but in the privacy of his own chamber, or in the midst of his
own family, he gave himself up to the deepest abstraction. Occupied
with some interesting investigation, he would often sit down on his
bedside, after he rose, and remain there, for hours, partially dressed.
Meal-time would frequently come and pass unheeded; so that, unless
urgently reminded, he would neglect to take the requisite quantity of
nourishment. But notwithstanding his anxiety to be left undisturbed,
he would, when occasion required, turn aside his thoughts, though bent
upon the most intricate research, and then, when leisure served, again
direct them to the very point where they ceased to act: and this he
seemed to accomplish not so much by the force of his memory, as by the
force of his inventive faculty, before the vigorous intensity of which,
no subject, however abstruse, remained long unexplored.</p>

<p>He was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, in
1699, when that distinguished Body were empowered, by a new charter, to
admit a small number of foreign associates. In 1700, he communicated to
Dr. Halley a description of his reflecting instrument for observing the
moon's distance from the fixed stars. This description was published
in the Philosophical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span> Transactions, in 1742. The instrument was the
same as that produced by Mr. Hadley, in 1731, and which, under the
name of Hadley's Quadrant, has been of so great use in navigation. On
the assembling of the new Parliament, in 1701, Newton was re-elected
one of the members for the University of Cambridge. In 1703, he was
chosen President of the Royal Society of London, to which office he was
annually re-elected till the period of his decease—about twenty-five
years afterward.</p>

<p>Our author unquestionably devoted more labour to, and, in many
respects, took a greater pride in his Optical, than his other
discoveries. This science he had placed on a new and indestructible
basis; and he wished not only to build, but to perfect the costly and
glowing structure. He had communicated, before the publication of the
<span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>, his most important researches
on light to the Royal Society, in detached papers which were inserted
in successive numbers of the Transactions; but he did not publish a
connected view of these labours till 1704, when they appeared under
the title of <span class="allsmcap">OPTICS: OR, A TREATISE ON THE
REFLEXIONS, REFRACTIONS, INFLEXIONS AND COLOURS OF LIGHT</span>.
To this, but to no subsequent edition, were added two Mathematical
Treatises, entitled, <span class="allsmcap">TRACTATUS DUO DE SPECIEBUS
ET MAGNITUDINE FIGURARUM CURVILINEARUM</span>; the one bearing the
title <span class="allsmcap">TRACTATUS DE QUADRATURA CURVARUM</span>;
and the other, that of <span class="allsmcap">ENUMERATIO LINEARUM
TERTII ORDINIS</span>. The publication of these Mathematical Treatises
was made necessary in consequence of plagiarisms from the manuscripts
of them loaned by the author to his friends. Dr. Samuel Clarke
published a Latin translation of the Optics, in 1706; whereupon he was
presented by Newton, as a mark of his grateful approbation, with five
hundred pounds, or one hundred pounds for each of his children. The
work was afterward translated into French. It had a remarkably wide
circulation, and appeared, in several successive editions, both in
England and on the Continent. There is displayed, particularly on this
Optical Treatise, the author's talent for simplifying and communicating
the profoundest speculations. It is a faculty rarely united to that
of the highest invention. Newton possessed both; and thus that
mental perfectness which enabled him to create, to combine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span> and to teach, and so
render himself, not the "ornament" only, but inconceivably more, the
pre-eminent benefactor of his species.</p>

<p>The honour of knighthood was conferred on our author in 1705. Soon
afterward, he was a candidate again for the Representation of the
University, but was defeated by a large majority. It is thought that
a more pliant man was preferred by both ministers and electors.
Newton was always remarkable for simplicity of dress, and his only
known departure from it was on this occasion, when he is said to have
appeared in a suit of laced clothes.</p>

<p>The Algebraical Lectures which he had, during nine years, delivered
at Cambridge, were published by Whiston, in 1707, under the title
of <span class="allsmcap">ARITHMETICA UNIVERSALIS, SINE DE COMPOSITIONE ET RESOLUTIONE
ARITHMETICA LIBER</span>. This publication is said to have been a breach
of confidence on Whiston's part. Mr. Ralphson, not long afterward,
translated the work into English; and a second edition of it, with
improvements by the author, was issued at London, 1712, by Dr. Machin.
Subsequent editions, both in English and Latin, with commentaries, have
been published.</p>

<p>In June, 1709, Newton intrusted the superintendence of a second edition
of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> to Roger Cotes, Plumian Professor of Astronomy at
Cambridge. The first edition had been sold off for some time. Copies of
the work had become very rare, and could only be obtained at several
times their original cost. A great number of letters passed between
the author and Mr. Cotes during the preparation of the edition,
which finally appeared in May, 1713. It had many alterations and
improvements, and was accompanied by an admirable Preface from the pen
of Cotes.</p>

<p>Our author's early Treatise, entitled, <span class="allsmcap">ANALYSIS PER EQUATIONES NUMERO TERMINORUM
INFINITAS</span>, as well as a small Tract, bearing the title of
<span class="allsmcap">METHODUS DIFFERENTIALIS</span>, was published,
with his consent, in 1711. The former of these, and the Treatise De
Quadratura Curvarum, translated into English, with a large commentary,
appeared in 1745. His work, entitled <span class="allsmcap">ARTIS
ANALYTICÆ SPECIMINA, VEL GEOMETRIA ANALYTICA</span>, was first given to
the world in the edition of Dr. Horsley, 1779.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>It is a notable fact, in Newton's history, that he never voluntarily
published any one of his purely mathematical writings. The cause
of this unwillingness in some, and, in other instances, of his
indifference, or, at least, want of solicitude to put forth his works
may be confidently sought for in his repugnance to everything like
contest or dispute. But, going deeper than this aversion, we find,
underlying his whole character and running parallel with all his
discoveries, that extraordinary humility which always preserved him
in a position so relatively just to the behests of time and eternity,
that the infinite value of truth, and the utter worthlessness of fame,
were alike constantly present to him. Judging of his course, however,
in its more temporary aspect, as bearing upon his immediate quiet, it
seemed the most unfortunate. For an early publication, especially in
the case of his Method of Fluxions, would have anticipated all rivalry,
and secured him from the contentious claims of Leibnitz. Still each one
will solve the problem of his existence in his own way, and, with a man
like Newton, his own, as we conceive, could be no other than the best
way. The conduct of Leibnitz in this affair is quite irreconcileable
with the stature and strength of the man; giant-like, and doing
nobly, in many ways, a giant's work, yet cringing himself into the
dimensions and performances of a common calumniator. Opening in 1699,
the discussion in question continued till the close of Leibnitz's life,
in 1716. We give the summary of the case as contained in the Report of
the Committee of the Royal Society, the deliberately weighed opinion of
which has been adopted as an authoritative decision in all countries.</p>

<p>"We have consulted the letters and letter books in the custody of the
Royal Society, and those found among the papers of Mr. John Collins,
dated between the years 1669 and 1677, inclusive; and showed them to
such as knew and avouched the hands of Mr. Barrow, Mr. Collins, Mr.
Oldenburg, and Mr. Leibnitz; and compared those of Mr. Gregory with
one another, and with copies of some of them taken in the hand of
Mr. Collins; and have extracted from them what relates to the matter
referred to us; all which extracts, herewith delivered to you, we
believe to be genuine and authentic. And by these letters and papers we
find:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>"I. Mr. Leibnitz was in London in the beginning of the year 1673; and
went thence in or about March, to Paris, where he kept a correspondence
with Mr. Collins, by means of Mr. Oldenburg, till about September,
1676, and then returned, by London and Amsterdam, to Hanover: and that
Mr. Collins was very free in communicating to able mathematicians what
he had received from Mr. Newton and Mr. Gregory.</p>

<p>"II. That when Mr. Leibnitz was the first time in London, he contended
for the invention of another differential method, properly so called;
and, notwithstanding he was shown by Dr. Pell that it was Newton's
method, persisted in maintaining it to be his own invention, by reason
that he had found it by himself without knowing what Newton had done
before, and had much improved it. And we find no mention of his having
any other differential method than Newton's before his letter of the
21st of June, 1677, which was a year after a copy of Mr. Newton's
letter of the 10th of December, 1672, had been sent to Paris to be
communicated to him; and above four years after Mr. Collins began to
communicate that letter to his correspondents; in which letter the
method of fluxions was sufficiently described to any intelligent person.</p>

<p>"III. That by Mr. Newton's letter, of the 13th of June, 1676, it
appears that he had the method of fluxions above five years before
the writing of that letter. And by his <span class="allsmcap">ANALYSIS PER EQUATIONES
NUMERO TERMINORUM INFINITAS</span>, communicated by Dr. Barrow to Mr. Collins, in
July, 1669, we find that he had invented the method before that time.</p>

<p>"IV. That the differential method is one and the same with the method
of fluxions, excepting the name and mode of notation; Mr. Leibnitz
calling those quantities differences which Mr. Newton calls moments, or
fluxions; and marking them with a letter <i>d</i>—a mark not used by
Mr. Newton.</p>

<p>"And, therefore, we take the proper question to be, not who invented
this or that method, but, who was the first inventor of the method? And
we believe that those who have reputed Mr. Leibnitz the first inventor
knew little or nothing of his correspondence with Mr. Collins and Mr.
Oldenburg long before, nor of Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span> Newton's having that method above
fifteen years before Mr. Leibnitz began to publish it in the Acta
Eruditorum of Leipsic.</p>

<p>"For which reason we reckon Mr. Newton the first inventor; and are
of opinion that Mr. Keill, in asserting the same, has been no ways
injurious to Mr. Leibnitz. And we submit to the judgment of the
Society, whether the extract and papers, now presented to you, together
with what is extant, to the same purpose, in Dr. Wallis's third volume,
may not deserve to be made public."</p>

<p>This Report, with the collection of letters and manuscripts, under
the title of <span class="allsmcap">COMMERCIUM EPISTOLICUM D. JOHANNIS COLLINS ET ALIORUM DE
ANALYSI PROMOTA JUSSU SOCIETATIS REGIÆ EDITUM</span>, appeared accordingly in
the early part of 1713. Its publication seemed to infuse additional
bitterness into the feelings of Leibnitz, who descended to unfounded
charges and empty threats. He had been privy counsellor to the Elector
of Hanover, before that prince was elevated to the British throne; and
in his correspondence, in 1715 and 1716, with the Abbé Conti, then
at the court of George I., and with Caroline, Princess of Wales, he
attacked the doctrines of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span>, and indirectly its author, in
a manner very discreditable to himself, both as a learned and as an
honourable man. His assaults, however, were triumphantly met; and, to
the complete overthrow of his rival pretensions, Newton was induced to
give the finishing blow. The verdict is universal and irreversible that
the English preceded the German philosopher, by at least ten years,
in the invention of fluxions. Newton could not have borrowed from
Leibnitz; but Leibnitz might have borrowed from Newton. A new edition
of the Commercium Epistolicum was published in 1722-5(?); but neither
in this, nor in the former edition, did our author take any part. The
disciples, enthusiastic, capable and ready, effectually shielded, with
the buckler of Truth, the character of the Master, whose own conduct
throughout was replete with delicacy, dignity and justice. He kept
aloof from the controversy—in which Dr. Keill stood forth as the chief
representative of the Newtonian side—till the very last, when, for
the satisfaction of the King, George I., rather than for his own, he
consented to put forth his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span> hand and firmly secure his rights upon a
certain and impregnable basis.</p>

<p>A petition to have inventions for promoting the discovery of the
longitude at sea, suitably rewarded, was presented to the House of
Commons, in 1714. A committee, having been appointed to investigate
the subject, called upon Newton and others for their opinions. That of
our author was given in writing. A report, favourable to the desired
measure, was then taken up, and a bill for its adoption subsequently
passed.</p>

<p>On the ascension of George I., in 1714, Newton became an object
of profound interest at court. His position under government, his
surpassing fame, his spotless character, and, above all, his deep
and consistent piety, attracted the reverent regard of the Princess
of Wales, afterward queen-consort to George II. She was a woman of
a highly cultivated mind, and derived the greatest pleasure from
conversing with Newton and corresponding with Leibnitz. One day, in
conversation with her, our author mentioned and explained a new system
of chronology, which he had composed at Cambridge, where he had been
in the habit "of refreshing himself with history and chronology, when
he was weary with other studies." Subsequently, in the year 1718,
she requested a copy of this interesting and ingenious work. Newton,
accordingly, drew up an abstract of the system from the separate papers
in which it existed, and gave it to her on condition that it should not
be communicated to any other person. Sometime afterward she requested
that the Abbé Conti might be allowed to have a copy of it. The author
consented: and the abbé received a copy of the manuscript, under the
like injunction and promise of secrecy. This manuscript bore the title
of "A short Chronicle, from the First Memory of Things in Europe, to
the Conquest of Persia, by Alexander the Great."</p>

<p>After Newton took up his residence in London, he lived in a style
suited to his elevated position and rank. He kept his carriage,
with an establishment of three male and three female servants. But
to everything like vain show and luxury he was utterly averse. His
household affairs, for the last twenty years of his life, were under
the charge of his niece, Mrs. Catherine Barton,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span> 
wife and widow of Colonel Barton—a woman of great beauty and
accomplishment—and subsequently married to John Conduit, Esq. At home
Newton was distinguished by that dignified and gentle hospitality
which springs alone from true nobleness. On all proper occasions, he
gave splendid entertainments, though without ostentation. In society,
whether of the palace or the cottage, his manner was self-possessed
and urbane; his look benign and affable; his speech candid and
modest; his whole air undisturbedly serene. He had none of what are
usually called the singularities of genius; suiting himself easily to
every company—except that of the vicious and wicked; and speaking of
himself and others, naturally, so as never even to be suspected of
vanity. There was in him, if we may be allowed the expression, a <span class="allsmcap">WHOLENESS</span> of nature, which did not admit of
such imperfections and weakness—the circle was too perfect, the law too
constant, and the disturbing forces too slight to suffer scarcely any
of those eccentricities which so interrupt and mar the movements of
many bright spirits, rendering their course through the world more like
that of the blazing meteor than that of the light and life-imparting
sun. In brief, the words <span class="allsmcap">GREATNESS</span>
and <span class="allsmcap">GOODNESS</span> could not, humanly
speaking, be more fitly employed than when applied as the pre-eminent
characteristics of this pure, meek and venerable sage.</p>

<p>In the eightieth year of his age, Newton was seized with symptoms
of stone in the bladder. His disease was pronounced incurable.
He succeeded, however, by means of a strict regimen, and other
precautions, in alleviating his complaint, and procuring long intervals
of ease. His diet, always frugal, was now extremely temperate,
consisting chiefly of broth, vegetables, and fruit, with, now and
then, a little butcher meat. He gave up the use of his carriage, and
employed, in its stead, when he went out, a chair. All invitations
to dinner were declined; and only small parties were received,
occasionally, at his own house.</p>

<p>In 1724 he wrote to the Lord Provost of Edinburgh, offering to
contribute twenty pounds yearly toward the salary of Mr. Maclaurin,
provided he accepted the assistant Professorship of Mathematics in
the University of that place. Not only in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span> cause of ingenuity and
learning, but in that of religion—in relieving the poor and assisting
his relations, Newton annually expended large sums. He was generous and
charitable almost to a fault. Those, he would often remark, who gave
away nothing till they died, never gave at all. His wealth had become
considerable by a prudent economy; but he regarded money in no other
light than as one of the means wherewith he had been intrusted to do
good, and he faithfully employed it accordingly.</p>

<p>He experienced, in spite of all his precautionary measures, a return of
his complaint in the month of August, of the same year, 1724, when he
passed a stone the size of pea; it came from him in two pieces, the one
at the distance of two days from the other. Tolerable good health then
followed for some months. In January, 1725, however, he was taken with
a violent cough and inflammation of the lungs. In consequence of this
attack, he was prevailed upon to remove to Kensington, where his health
greatly improved. In February following, he was attacked in both feet
with the gout, of the approach of which he had received, a few years
before, a slight warning, and the presence of which now produced a very
beneficial change in his general health. Mr. Conduit, his nephew, has
recorded a curious conversation which took place, at or near this time,
between himself and Sir Isaac.</p>

<p>"I was, on Sunday night, the 7th March, 1724-5, at Kensington, with
Sir Isaac Newton, in his lodgings, just after he was out of a fit of
the gout, which he had had in both of his feet, for the first time,
in the eighty-third year of his age. He was better after it, and his
head clearer and memory stronger than I had known them for some time.
He then repeated to me, by way of discourse, very distinctly, though
rather in answer to my queries, than in one continued narration, what
he had often hinted to me before, viz.: that it was his conjecture
(he would affirm nothing) that there was a sort of revolution in the
heavenly bodies; that the vapours and light, emitted by the sun, which
had their sediment, as water and other matter, had gathered themselves,
by degrees, into a body, and attracted more matter from the planets,
and at last made a secondary planet (viz.: one of those that go round
another planet), and then, by gathering to them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span> attracting more
matter, became a primary planet; and then, by increasing still, became
a comet, which, after certain revolutions, by coming nearer and nearer
to the sun, had all its volatile parts condensed, and became a matter
fit to recruit and replenish the sun (which must waste by the constant
heat and light it emitted), as a faggot would this fire if put into it
(we were sitting by a wood fire), and that that would probably be the
effect of the comet of 1680, sooner or later; for, by the observations
made upon it, it appeared, before it came near the sun, with a tail
only two or three degrees long; but, by the heat it contracted, in
going so near the sun, it seemed to have a tail of thirty or forty
degrees when it went from it; that he could not say when this comet
would drop into the sun; it might perhaps have five or six revolutions
more first, but whenever it did it would so much increase the heat of
the sun that this earth would be burned, and no animals in it could
live. That he took the three phenomena, seen by Hipparchus, Tycho
Brahe, and Kepler's disciples, to have been of this kind, for he could
not otherwise account for an extraordinary light, as those were,
appearing, all at once, among the fixed stars (all which he took to
be suns, enlightening other planets, as our sun does ours), as big as
Mercury or Venus seems to us, and gradually diminishing, for sixteen
months, and then sinking into nothing. He seemed to doubt whether
there were not intelligent beings, superior to us, who superintended
these revolutions of the heavenly bodies, by the direction of the
Supreme Being. He appeared also to be very clearly of opinion that the
inhabitants of this world were of short date, and alledged, as one
reason for that opinion, that all arts, as letters, ships, printing,
needle, &amp;c., were discovered within the memory of history, which could
not have happened if the world had been eternal; and that there were
visible marks of ruin upon it which could not be effected by flood
only. When I asked him how this earth could have been repeopled if ever
it had undergone the same fate it was threatened with hereafter, by
the comet of 1680, he answered, that required the power of a Creator.
He said he took all the planets to be composed of the same matter with
this earth, viz.: earth, water, stones, &amp;c., but variously concocted.
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span> asked him why he would not publish his conjectures, as conjectures,
and instanced that Kepler had communicated his; and though he had not
gone near so far as Kepler, yet Kepler's guesses were so just and
happy that they had been proved and demonstrated by him. His answer
was, "I do not deal in conjectures." But, on my talking to him about
the four observations that had been made of the comet of 1680, at 574
years' distance, and asking him the particular times, he opened his
<i>Principia</i>, which laid on the table, and showed me the particular
periods, viz.: 1st. The Julium Sidus, in the time of Justinian, in
1106, in 1680.</p>

<p>"And I, observing that he said there of that comet, 'incidet in corpus
solis,' and in the next paragraph adds, 'stellæ fixæ refici possunt,'
told him I thought he owned there what we had been talking about,
viz.: that the comet would drop into the sun, and that fixed stars
were recruited and replenished by comets when they dropped into them;
and, consequently, that the sun would be recruited too; and asked him
why he would not own as fully what he thought of the sun as well as
what he thought of the fixed stars. He said, 'that concerned us more;'
and, laughing, added, that he had said enough for people to know his
meaning."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1725, a French translation of the chronological
MS., of which the Abbé Conti had been permitted, some time previous,
to have a copy, was published at Paris, in violation of all good
faith. The <i>Punic</i> Abbé had continued true to his promise of
secrecy while he remained in England; but no sooner did he reach
Paris than he placed the manuscript into the hands of M. Freret, a
learned antiquarian, who translated the work, and accompanied it
with an attempted refutation of the leading points of the system. In
November, of the same year, Newton received a presentation copy of this
publication, which bore the title of <span class="allsmcap">ABRÉGÉ
DE CHRONOLOGIE DE M. LE CHEVALIER NEWTON, FAIT PAR LUI-MÊME, ET
TRADUIT SUR LE MANUSCRIPT ANGLAIS</span>. Soon afterward a paper
entitled, <span class="allsmcap">REMARKS ON THE OBESRVATIONS MADE ON
A CHRONOLOGICAL INDEX OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON, TRANSLATED INTO FRENCH BY
THE OBSERVATOR, AND PUBLISHED AT PARIS</span>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span> was drawn up by our author, and printed in
the Philosophical Transactions for 1725. It contained a history of the
whole matter, and a triumphant reply to the objections of M. Freret.
This answer called into the field a fresh antagonist, Father Soueiet,
whose five dissertations on this subject were chiefly remarkable for
the want of knowledge and want of decorum, which they displayed. In
consequence of these discussions, Newton was induced to prepare his
larger work for the press, and had nearly completed it at the time
of his death. It was published in 1728, under the title of 
<span class="allsmcap">THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE ANCIENT KINGDOMS AMENDED, TO
WHICH IS PREFIXED A SHORT CHRONICLE FROM THE FIRST MEMORY OF THINGS
IN EUROPE TO THE CONQUEST OF PERSIA BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT</span>. It
consists of six chapters: 1. On the Chronology of the Greeks; according
to Whiston, our author wrote out eighteen copies of this chapter with
his own hand, differing little from one another. 2. Of the Empire of
Egypt; 3. Of the Assyrian Empire; 4. Of the two contemporary Empires of
the Babylonians and Medes; 5. A Description of the Temple of Solomon;
6. Of the Empire of the Persians; this chapter was not found copied
with the other five, but as it was discovered among his papers, and
appeared to be a continuation of the same work, the Editor thought
proper to add it thereto. Newton's <span class="allsmcap">LETTER TO A
PERSON OF DISTINCTION WHO HAD DESIRED HIS OPINION OF THE LEARNED BISHOP
LLOYD'S HYPOTHESIS CONCERNING THE FORM OF THE MOST ANCIENT YEAR</span>,
closes this enumeration of his Chronological Writings.</p>

<p>A third edition of the <span class="allsmcap">PRINCIPIA</span> appeared in 1726, with many changes
and additions. About four years were consumed in its preparation
and publication, which were under the superintendence of Dr. Henry
Pemberton, an accomplished mathematician, and the author of "<span class="allsmcap">A VIEW OF
SIR ISAAC NEWTON'S PHILOSOPHY</span>," 1728. This gentleman enjoyed numerous
opportunities of conversing with the aged and illustrious author. "I
found," says Pemberton, "he had read fewer of the modern mathematicians
than one could have expected; but his own prodigious invention readily
supplied him with what he might have an occasion for in the pursuit
of any subject he undertook. I have often<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span> heard him censure the
handling geometrical subjects by algebraic calculations; and his book
of Algebra he called by the name of Universal Arithmetic, in opposition
to the injudicious title of Geometry, which Descartes had given to the
treatise, wherein he shows how the geometer may assist his invention
by such kind of computations. He thought Huygens the most elegant of
any mathematical writer of modern times, and the most just imitator
of the ancients. Of their taste and form of demonstration, Sir Isaac
always professed himself a great admirer. I have heard him even censure
himself for not following them yet more closely than he did; and
speak with regret of his mistake at the beginning of his mathematical
studies, in applying himself to the works of Descartes and other
algebraic writers, before he had considered the elements of Euclid with
that attention which so excellent a writer deserves."</p>

<p>"Though his memory was much decayed," continues Dr. Pemberton, "he
perfectly understood his own writings." And even this failure of
memory, we would suggest, might have been more apparent than real, or,
in medical terms, more the result of functional weakness than organic
decay. Newton seems never to have confided largely to his memory: and
as this faculty manifests the most susceptibility to cultivation; so,
in the neglect of due exercise, it more readily and plainly shows a
diminution of its powers.</p>

<p>Equanimity and temperance had, indeed, preserved Newton singularly free
from all mental and bodily ailment. His hair was, to the last, quite
thick, though as white as silver. He never made use of spectacles, and
lost but one tooth to the day of his death. He was of middle stature,
well-knit, and, in the latter part of his life, somewhat inclined to
be corpulent. Mr. Conduit says, "he had a very lively and piercing
eye, a comely and gracious aspect, with a fine head of hair, white
as silver, without any baldness, and when his peruke was off was a
venerable sight." According to Bishop Atterbury, "in the whole air
of his face and make there was nothing of that penetrating sagacity
which appears in his compositions. He had something rather languid
in his look and manner which did not raise any great expectation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span> in
those who did not know him." Hearne remarks, "Sir Isaac was a man of
no very promising aspect. He was a short, well-set man. He was full of
thought, and spoke very little in company, so that his conversation was
not agreeable. When he rode in his coach, one arm would be out of his
coach on one side and the other on the other." These different accounts
we deem easily reconcilable. In the rooms of the Royal Society, in
the street, or in mixed assemblages, Newton's demeanour—always
courteous, unassuming and kindly—still had in it the overawings of a
profound repose and reticency, out of which the communicative spirit,
and the "lively and piercing eye" would only gleam in the quiet and
unrestrained freedom of his own fire-side.</p>

<p>"But this I immediately discovered in him," adds Pemberton, still
further, "which at once both surprised and charmed me. Neither his
extreme great age, nor his universal reputation had rendered him stiff
in opinion, or in any degree elated. Of this I had occasion to have
almost daily experience. The remarks I continually sent him by letters
on his Principia, were received with the utmost goodness. These were
so far from being anyways displeasing to him, that, on the contrary,
it occasioned him to speak many kind things of me to my friends, and
to honour me with a public testimony of his good opinion." A modesty,
openness, and generosity, peculiar to the noble and comprehensive
spirit of Newton. "Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty," yet not
lifted up by pride nor corrupted by ambition. None, however, knew so
well as himself the stupendousness of his discoveries in comparison
with all that had been previously achieved; and none realized so
thoroughly as himself the littleness thereof in comparison with the
vast region still unexplored. A short time before his death he uttered
this memorable sentiment:—"I do not know what I may appear to the
world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on
the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of
truth lay all undiscovered before me." How few ever reach the shore
even, much less find "a smoother pebble or a prettier shell!"</p>

<p>Newton had now resided about two years at Kensington; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span> the air
which he enjoyed there, and the state of absolute rest, proved of
great benefit to him. Nevertheless he would occasionally go to town.
And on Tuesday, the 28th of February, 1727, he proceeded to London,
for the purpose of presiding at a meeting of the Royal Society. At
this time his health was considered, by Mr. Conduit, better than it
had been for many years. But the unusual fatigue he was obliged to
suffer, in attending the meeting, and in paying and receiving visits,
speedily produced a violent return of the affection in the bladder. He
returned to Kensington on Saturday, the 4th of March. Dr. Mead and Dr.
Cheselden attended him; they pronounced his disease to be the stone,
and held out no hopes of recovery. On Wednesday, the 15th of March, he
seemed a little better; and slight, though groundless, encouragement
was felt that he might survive the attack. From the very first of
it, his sufferings had been intense. Paroxysm followed paroxysm, in
quick succession: large drops of sweat rolled down his face; but not a
groan, not a complaint, not the least mark of peevishness or impatience
escaped him: and during the short intervals of relief, he even smiled
and conversed with his usual composure and cheerfulness. The flesh
quivered, but the heart quaked not; the impenetrable gloom was settling
down: the Destroyer near; the portals of the tomb opening, still, amid
this utter wreck and dissolution of the mortal, the immortal remained
serene, unconquerable: the radiant light broke through the gathering
darkness; and Death yielded up its sting, and the grave its victory. On
Saturday morning, 18th, he read the newspapers, and carried on a pretty
long conversation with Dr. Mead. His senses and faculties were then
strong and vigorous; but at six o'clock, the same evening, he became
insensible; and in this state he continued during the whole of Sunday,
and till Monday, the 20th, when he expired, between one and two o'clock
in the morning, in the eighty-fifth year of his age.</p>

<p>And these were the last days of Isaac Newton. Thus closed the career of
one of earth's greatest and best men. His mission was fulfilled. Unto
the Giver, in many-fold addition, the talents were returned. While it
was yet day he had worked; and for the night that quickly cometh he was
not unprepared. Full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span> years, and full of honours, the heaven-sent
was recalled; and, in the confidence of a "certain hope," peacefully he
passed away into the silent depths of Eternity.</p>

<p>His body was placed in Westminster Abbey, with the state and ceremonial
that usually attended the interment of the most distinguished. In
1731, his relatives, the inheritors of his personal estate, erected
a monument to his memory in the most conspicuous part of the Abbey,
which had often been refused by the dean and chapter to the greatest
of England's nobility. During the same year a medal was struck at
the Tower in his honour; and, in 1755, a full-length statue of him,
in white marble, admirably executed, by Roubiliac, at the expense of
Dr. Robert Smith, was erected in the ante-chamber of Trinity College,
Cambridge. There is a painting executed in the glass of one of the
windows of the same college, made pursuant to the will of Dr. Smith,
who left five hundred pounds for that purpose.</p>

<p>Newton left a personal estate of about thirty-two thousand pounds.
It was divided among his four nephews and four nieces of the half
blood, the grand-children of his mother, by the Reverend Mr. Smith.
The family estates of Woolsthorpe and Sustern fell to John Newton, the
heir-at-law, whose great grandfather was Sir Isaac's uncle. Before his
death he made an equitable distribution of his two other estates: the
one in Berkshire to the sons and daughter of a brother of Mrs. Conduit;
and the other, at Kensington, to Catharine, the only daughter of Mr.
Conduit, and who afterward became Viscountess Lymington. Mr. Conduit
succeeded to the offices of the Mint, the duties of which he had
discharged during the last two years of Sir Isaac's life.</p>

<p>Our author's works are found in the collection of Castilion, Berlin,
1744, 4to. 8 tom.; in Bishop Horsley's Edition, London, 1779, 4to. 5
vol.; in the Biographia Brittannica, &amp;c. Newton also published <i>Bern.
Varenius</i> Geographia, &amp;c., 1681, 8vo. There are, however, numerous
manuscripts, letters, and other papers, which have never been given to
the world: these are preserved, in various collections, namely, in the
library of Trinity College, Cambridge; in the library of Corpus Christi
College, Oxford; in the library of Lord Macclesfield; and, lastly and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
chiefly, in the possession of the family of the Earl of Portsmouth,
through the Viscountess Lymington.</p>

<p>Everything appertaining to Newton has been kept and cherished with
peculiar veneration. Different memorials of him are preserved in
Trinity College, Cambridge; in the rooms of the Royal Society, of
London; and in the Museum of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The manor-house, at Woolsthorpe, was visited by Dr. Stukeley, in
October, 1721, who, in a letter to Dr. Mead, written in 1727, gave
the following description of it:—"'Tis built of stone, as is the way
of the country hereabouts, and a reasonably good one. They led me up
stairs and showed me Sir Isaac's study, where I supposed he studied,
when in the country, in his younger days, or perhaps when he visited
his mother from the University. I observed the shelves were of his own
making, being pieces of deal boxes, which probably he sent his books
and clothes down in on those occasions. There were, some years ago, two
or three hundred books in it of his father-in-law, Mr. Smith, which Sir
Isaac gave to Dr. Newton, of our town." The celebrated apple-tree, the
fall of one of the apples of which is said to have turned the attention
of Newton to the subject of gravity, was destroyed by the wind about
twenty years ago; but it has been preserved in the form of a chair. The
house itself has been protected with religious care. It was repaired in
1798, and a tablet of white marble put up in the room where our author
was born, with the following inscription:—</p>

<p>"Sir Isaac Newton, son of John Newton, Lord of the Manor of
Woolsthorpe, was born in this room, on the 25th of December, 1642."</p>

<p>SINCE the ancients (as we are told by <i>Pappus</i>), made great
account of the science of mechanics in the investigation of natural
things; and the moderns, laying aside substantial forms and occult
qualities, have endeavoured to subject the phænomena of nature to the
laws of mathematics, I have in this treatise cultivated mathematics
so far as it regards philosophy. The ancients considered mechanics
in a twofold respect; as rational, which proceeds accurately by
demonstration; and practical. To practical mechanics all the manual
arts belong, from which mechanics took its name. But as artificers
do not work with perfect accuracy, it comes to pass that mechanics
is so distinguished from geometry, that what is perfectly accurate
is called geometrical; what is less so, is called mechanical. But
the errors are not in the art, but in the artificers. He that works
with less accuracy is an imperfect mechanic; and if any could work
with perfect accuracy, he would be the most perfect mechanic of all;
for the description of right lines and circles, upon which geometry
is founded, belongs to mechanics. Geometry does not teach us to draw
these lines, but requires them to be drawn; for it requires that the
learner should first be taught to describe these accurately, before he
enters upon geometry; then it shows how by these operations problems
may be solved. To describe right lines and circles are problems, but
not geometrical problems. The solution of these problems is required
from mechanics; and by geometry the use of them, when so solved, is
shown; and it is the glory of geometry that from those few principles,
brought from without, it is able to produce so many things. Therefore
geometry is founded in mechanical practice, and is nothing but that
part of universal mechanics which accurately proposes and demonstrates
the art of measuring. But since the manual arts are chiefly conversant
in the moving of bodies, it comes to pass that geometry is commonly
referred to their magnitudes, and mechanics to their motion. In this
sense rational mechanics will be the science of motions resulting
from any forces whatsoever, and of the forces required to produce any
motions, accurately proposed and demonstrated. This part of mechanics
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</span> cultivated by the ancients in the five powers which relate to
manual arts who considered gravity (it not being a manual power),
no otherwise than as it moved weights by those powers. Our design
not respecting arts, but philosophy, and our subject not manual but
natural powers, we consider chiefly those things which relate to
gravity, levity, elastic force, the resistance of fluids, and the
like forces, whether attractive or impulsive; and therefore we offer
this work as the mathematical principles of philosophy; for all the
difficulty of philosophy seems to consist in this—from the phænomena
of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from these
forces to demonstrate the other phænomena; and to this end the general
propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the third
book we give an example of this in the explication of the System of
the World; for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the
former books, we in the third derive from the celestial phænomena the
forces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and the several
planets. Then from these forces, by other propositions which are also
mathematical, we deduce the motions of the planets, the comets, the
moon, and the sea. I wish we could derive the rest of the phænomena
of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles;
for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend
upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes
hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards each other, and
cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each other;
which forces being unknown, philosophers have hitherto attempted the
search of nature in vain; but I hope the principles here laid down will
afford some light either to this or some truer method of philosophy.</p>

<p>In the publication of this work the most acute and universally learned
Mr. Edmund Halley not only assisted me with his pains in correcting the
press and taking care of the schemes, but it was to his solicitations
that its becoming public is owing; for when he had obtained of me my
demonstrations of the figure of the celestial orbits, he continually
pressed me to communicate the same to the <i>Royal Society</i>, who
afterwards, by their kind encouragement and entreaties, engaged me
to think of publishing them. But after I had begun to consider the
inequalities of the lunar motions, and had entered upon some other
things relating to the laws and measures of gravity, and other
forces; and the figures that would be described by bodies attracted
according to given laws; and the motion of several bodies moving among
themselves; the motion of bodies in resisting mediums; the forces,
densities, and motions, of mediums; the orbits of the comets, and
such like;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</span> I deferred that publication till I had made a search into
those matters, and could put forth the whole together. What relates
to the lunar motions (being imperfect), I have put all together in
the corollaries of Prop. 66, to avoid being obliged to propose and
distinctly demonstrate the several things there contained in a method
more prolix than the subject deserved, and interrupt the series of the
several propositions. Some things, found out after the rest, I chose
to insert in places less suitable, rather than change the number of
the propositions and the citations. I heartily beg that what I have
here done may be read with candour; and that the defects in a subject
so difficult be not so much reprehended as kindly supplied, and
investigated by new endeavours of my readers.</p>

<p class="space-above2">
In the second edition the second section of the first book was
enlarged. In the seventh section of the second book the theory of
the resistances of fluids was more accurately investigated, and
confirmed by new experiments. In the third book the moon's theory and
the præcession of the equinoxes were more fully deduced from their
principles; and the theory of the comets was confirmed by more examples
of the calculation of their orbits, done also with greater accuracy.</p>

<p>In this third edition the resistance of mediums is somewhat more
largely handled than before; and new experiments of the resistance of
heavy bodies falling in air are added. In the third book, the argument
to prove that the moon is retained in its orbit by the force of gravity
is enlarged on; and there are added new observations of Mr. Pound's of
the proportion of the diameters of <i>Jupiter</i> to each other: there
are, besides, added Mr. Kirk's observations of the comet in 1680; the
orbit of that comet computed in an ellipsis by Dr. Halley; and the
orbit of the comet in 1723 computed by Mr. Bradley.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DEFINITIONS">DEFINITIONS.</h2>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION I.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The quantity of matter is the measure of the same, arising from its
density and bulk conjunctly.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus air of a double density, in a double space, is quadruple in
quantity; in a triple space, sextuple in quantity. The same thing is to
be understood of snow, and fine dust or powders, that are condensed by
compression or liquefaction; and of all bodies that are by any causes
whatever differently condensed. I have no regard in this place to a
medium, if any such there is, that freely pervades the interstices
between the parts of bodies. It is this quantity that I mean hereafter
everywhere under the name of body or mass. And the same is known by the
weight of each body; for it is proportional to the weight, as I have
found by experiments on pendulums, very accurately made, which shall be
shewn hereafter.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION II.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The quantity of motion is the measure of the same, arising from the
velocity and quantity of matter conjunctly.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The motion of the whole is the sum of the motions of all the parts; and
therefore in a body double in quantity, with equal velocity, the motion
is double; with twice the velocity, it is quadruple.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION III.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The <span class="antiqua">vis insita</span>, or innate force of matter, is a power of
resisting, by which every body, as much as in it lies, endeavours to
persevere in its present state, whether it be of rest, or of moving
uniformly forward in a right line.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This force is ever proportional to the body whose force it is; and
differs nothing from the inactivity of the mass, but in our manner of
conceiving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span> it. A body, from the inactivity of matter, is not without
difficulty put out of its state of rest or motion. Upon which account,
this <i>vis insita</i>, may, by a most significant name, be called
<i>vis inertiæ</i>, or force of inactivity. But a body exerts this
force only, when another force, impressed upon it, endeavours to change
its condition; and the exercise of this force may be considered both
as resistance and impulse; it is resistance, in so far as the body,
for maintaining its present state, withstands the force impressed; it
is impulse, in so far as the body, by not easily giving way to the
impressed force of another, endeavours to change the state of that
other. Resistance is usually ascribed to bodies at rest, and impulse to
those in motion; but motion and rest, as commonly conceived, are only
relatively distinguished; nor are those bodies always truly at rest,
which commonly are taken to be so.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION IV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>An impressed force is an action exerted upon a body, in order to
change its state, either of rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a
right line.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This force consists in this action only; and remains no longer in the
body, when the action is over. For a body maintains every new state
it acquires, by its <i>vis inertiæ</i> only. Impressed forces are of
different origins; as from percussion, from pressure, from centripetal
force.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION V.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A centripetal force is that by which bodies are drawn or impelled,
or any way tend, towards a point as to a centre.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Of this sort is gravity, by which bodies tend to the centre of the
earth; magnetism, by which iron tends to the loadstone; and that force,
whatever it is, by which the planets are perpetually drawn aside
from the rectilinear motions, which otherwise they would pursue, and
made to revolve in curvilinear orbits. A stone, whirled about in a
sling, endeavours to recede from the hand that turns it; and by that
endeavour, distends the sling, and that with so much the greater force,
as it is revolved with the greater velocity, and as soon as ever it is
let go, flies away. That force which opposes itself to this endeavour,
and by which the sling perpetually draws back the stone towards the
hand, and retains it in its orbit, because it is directed to the hand
as the centre of the orbit, I call the centripetal force. And the same
thing is to be understood of all bodies, revolved in any orbits. They
all endeavour to recede from the centres of their orbits; and were it
not for the opposition of a contrary force which restrains them to,
and detains them in their orbits, which I therefore call centripetal,
would fly off in right lines, with an uniform motion. A projectile,
if it was not for the force of gravity, would not deviate towards the
earth, but would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span> go off from it in a right line, and that with an
uniform motion, if the resistance of the air was taken away. It is by
its gravity that it is drawn aside perpetually from its rectilinear
course, and made to deviate towards the earth, more or less, according
to the force of its gravity, and the velocity of its motion. The less
its gravity is, for the quantity of its matter, or the greater the
velocity with which it is projected, the less will it deviate from
a rectilinear course, and the farther it will go. If a leaden ball,
projected from the top of a mountain by the force of gunpowder with a
given velocity, and in a direction parallel to the horizon, is carried
in a curve line to the distance of two miles before it falls to the
ground; the same, if the resistance of the air were taken away, with a
double or decuple velocity, would fly twice or ten times as far. And by
increasing the velocity, we may at pleasure increase the distance to
which it might be projected, and diminish the curvature of the line,
which it might describe, till at last it should fall at the distance
of 10, 30, or 90 degrees, or even might go quite round the whole earth
before it falls; or lastly, so that it might never fall to the earth,
but go forward into the celestial spaces, and proceed in its motion
<i>in infinitum</i>. And after the same manner that a projectile, by
the force of gravity, may be made to revolve in an orbit, and go round
the whole earth, the moon also, either by the force of gravity, if it
is endued with gravity, or by any other force, that impels it towards
the earth, may be perpetually drawn aside towards the earth, out of
the rectilinear way, which by its innate force it would pursue; and
would be made to revolve in the orbit which it now describes; nor
could the moon without some such force, be retained in its orbit. If
this force was too small, it would not sufficiently turn the moon out
of a rectilinear course: if it was too great, it would turn it too
much, and draw down the moon from its orbit towards the earth. It is
necessary, that the force be of a just quantity, and it belongs to the
mathematicians to find the force, that may serve exactly to retain a
body in a given orbit, with a given velocity; and <i>vice versa</i>, to
determine the curvilinear way, into which a body projected from a given
place, with a given velocity, may be made to deviate from its natural
rectilinear way, by means of a given force.</p>

<p>The quantity of any centripetal force may be considered as of three
kinds; absolute, accelerative, and motive.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION VI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The absolute quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of the
same proportional to the efficacy of the cause that propagates it from
the centre, through the spaces round about.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>Thus the magnetic force is greater in one load-stone and less in
another according to their sizes and strength of intensity.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The accelerative quantity of a centripetal force is the measure of
the same, proportional to the velocity which it generates in a given
time.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus the force of the same load-stone is greater at a less distance,
and less at a greater: also the force of gravity is greater in
valleys, less on tops of exceeding high mountains; and yet less (as
shall hereafter be shown), at greater distances from the body of the
earth; but at equal distances, it is the same everywhere; because
(taking away, or allowing for, the resistance of the air), it equally
accelerates all falling bodies, whether heavy or light, great or small.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">DEFINITION VIII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The motive quantity of a centripetal force, is the measure of the
same, proportional to the motion which it generates in a given time.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Thus the weight is greater in a greater body, less in a less body; and,
in the same body, it is greater near to the earth, and less at remoter
distances. This sort of quantity is the centripetency, or propension of
the whole body towards the centre, or, as I may say, its weight; and
it is always known by the quantity of an equal and contrary force just
sufficient to hinder the descent of the body.</p>

<p>These quantities of forces, we may, for brevity's sake, call by
the names of motive, accelerative, and absolute forces; and, for
distinction's sake, consider them, with respect to the bodies that
tend to the centre; to the places of those bodies; and to the centre
of force towards which they tend; that is to say, I refer the motive
force to the body as an endeavour and propensity of the whole towards
a centre, arising from the propensities of the several parts taken
together; the accelerative force to the place of the body, as a certain
power or energy diffused from the centre to all places around to move
the bodies that are in them; and the absolute force to the centre, as
endued with some cause, without which those motive forces would not
be propagated through the spaces round about; whether that cause be
some central body (such as is the load-stone, in the centre of the
magnetic force, or the earth in the centre of the gravitating force),
or anything else that does not yet appear. For I here design only to
give a mathematical notion of those forces, without considering their
physical causes and seats.</p>

<p>Wherefore the accelerative force will stand in the same relation to
the motive, as celerity does to motion. For the quantity of motion
arises from the celerity drawn into the quantity of matter; and the
motive force arises from the accelerative force drawn into the same
quantity of matter. For the sum of the actions of the accelerative
force, upon the several particles of the body, is the motive force of
the whole. Hence it is, that near the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span> surface of the earth, where the
accelerative gravity, or force productive of gravity, in all bodies
is the same, the motive gravity or the weight is as the body: but if
we should ascend to higher regions, where the accelerative gravity
is less, the weight would be equally diminished, and would always be
as the product of the body, by the accelerative gravity. So in those
regions, where the accelerative gravity is diminished into one half,
the weight of a body two or three times less, will be four or six times
less.</p>

<p>I likewise call attractions and impulses, in the same sense,
accelerative, and motive; and use the words attraction, impulse
or propensity of any sort towards a centre, promiscuously, and
indifferently, one for another; considering those forces not
physically, but mathematically: wherefore, the reader is not to
imagine, that by those words, I anywhere take upon me to define the
kind, or the manner of any action, the causes or the physical reason
thereof, or that I attribute forces, in a true and physical sense,
to certain centres (which are only mathematical points); when at any
time I happen to speak of centres as attracting, or as endued with
attractive powers.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have laid down the definitions of such words as are less
known, and explained the sense in which I would have them to be
understood in the following discourse. I do not define time, space,
place and motion, as being well known to all. Only I must observe,
that the vulgar conceive those quantities under no other notions but
from the relation they bear to sensible objects. And thence arise
certain prejudices, for the removing of which, it will be convenient
to distinguish them into absolute and relative, true and apparent,
mathematical and common.</p>

<p>I. Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its
own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by
another name is called duration: relative, apparent, and common time,
is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure
of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of
true time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a year.</p>

<p>II. Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything
external, remains always similar and immovable. Relative space is some
movable dimension or measure of the absolute spaces; which our senses
determine by its position to bodies; and which is vulgarly taken for
immovable space; such is the dimension of a subterraneous, an æreal, or
celestial space, determined by its position in respect of the earth.
Absolute and relative space, are the same in figure and magnitude; but
they do not remain always numerically the same. For if the earth, for
instance, moves, a space of our air, which relatively and in respect
of the earth remains always the same, will at one time be one part of
the absolute space into which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span> the air passes; at another time it will
be another part of the same, and so, absolutely understood, it will be
perpetually mutable.</p>

<p>III. Place is a part of space which a body takes up, and is according
to the space, either absolute or relative. I say, a part of space; not
the situation, nor the external surface of the body. For the places
of equal solids are always equal; but their superfices, by reason of
their dissimilar figures, are often unequal. Positions properly have no
quantity, nor are they so much the places themselves, as the properties
of places. The motion of the whole is the same thing with the sum of
the motions of the parts; that is, the translation of the whole, out
of its place, is the same thing with the sum of the translations of
the parts out of their places; and therefore the place of the whole is
the same thing with the sum of the places of the parts, and for that
reason, it is internal, and in the whole body.</p>

<p>IV. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute
place into another; and relative motion, the translation from one
relative place into another. Thus in a ship under sail, the relative
place of a body is that part of the ship which the body possesses;
or that part of its cavity which the body fills, and which therefore
moves together with the ship: and relative rest is the continuance of
the body in the same part of the ship, or of its cavity. But real,
absolute rest, is the continuance of the body in the same part of that
immovable space, in which the ship itself, its cavity, and all that
it contains, is moved. Wherefore, if the earth is really at rest, the
body, which relatively rests in the ship, will really and absolutely
move with the same velocity which the ship has on the earth. But if the
earth also moves, the true and absolute motion of the body will arise,
partly from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space; partly
from the relative motion of the ship on the earth; and if the body
moves also relatively in the ship; its true motion will arise, partly
from the true motion of the earth, in immovable space, and partly from
the relative motions as well of the ship on the earth, as of the body
in the ship; and from these relative motions will arise the relative
motion of the body on the earth. As if that part of the earth, where
the ship is, was truly moved toward the east, with a velocity of 10010
parts; while the ship itself, with a fresh gale, and full sails, is
carried towards the west, with a velocity expressed by 10 of those
parts; but a sailor walks in the ship towards the east, with 1 part of
the said velocity; then the sailor will be moved truly in immovable
space towards the east, with a velocity of 10001 parts, and relatively
on the earth towards the west, with a velocity of 9 of those parts.</p>

<p>Absolute time, in astronomy, is distinguished from relative, by the
equation or correction of the vulgar time. For the natural days are
truly unequal, though they are commonly considered as equal, and used
for a measure of time; astronomers correct this inequality for their
more accurate deducing of the celestial motions. It may be, that there
is no such thing as an equable motion, whereby time may be accurately
measured. All motions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span> may be accelerated and retarded, but the true,
or equable, progress of absolute time is liable to no change. The
duration or perseverance of the existence of things remains the same,
whether the motions are swift or slow, or none at all: and therefore
it ought to be distinguished from what are only sensible measures
thereof; and out of which we collect it, by means of the astronomical
equation. The necessity of which equation, for determining the times of
a phænomenon, is evinced as well from the experiments of the pendulum
clock, as by eclipses of the satellites of <i>Jupiter</i>.</p>

<p>As the order of the parts of time is immutable, so also is the order
of the parts of space. Suppose those parts to be moved out of their
places, and they will be moved (if the expression may be allowed) out
of themselves. For times and spaces are, as it were, the places as well
of themselves as of all other things. All things are placed in time as
to order of succession; and in space as to order of situation. It is
from their essence or nature that they are places; and that the primary
places of things should be moveable, is absurd. These are therefore the
absolute places; and translations out of those places, are the only
absolute motions.</p>

<p>But because the parts of space cannot be seen, or distinguished from
one another by our senses, therefore in their stead we use sensible
measures of them. For from the positions and distances of things from
any body considered as immovable, we define all places; and then with
respect to such places, we estimate all motions, considering bodies as
transferred from some of those places into others. And so, instead of
absolute places and motions, we use relative ones; and that without any
inconvenience in common affairs; but in philosophical disquisitions,
we ought to abstract from our senses, and consider things themselves,
distinct from what are only sensible measures of them. For it may be
that there is no body really at rest, to which the places and motions
of others may be referred.</p>

<p>But we may distinguish rest and motion, absolute and relative, one from
the other by their properties, causes and effects. It is a property of
rest, that bodies really at rest do rest in respect to one another. And
therefore as it is possible, that in the remote regions of the fixed
stars, or perhaps far beyond them, there may be some body absolutely
at rest; but impossible to know, from the position of bodies to one
another in our regions whether any of these do keep the same position
to that remote body; it follows that absolute rest cannot be determined
from the position of bodies in our regions.</p>

<p>It is a property of motion, that the parts, which retain given
positions to their wholes, do partake of the motions of those wholes.
For all the parts of revolving bodies endeavour to recede from the axis
of motion; and the impetus of bodies moving forward, arises from the
joint impetus of all the parts. Therefore, if surrounding bodies are
moved, those that are relatively at rest within them, will partake of
their motion. Upon which account, the true and absolute motion of a
body cannot be determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span> by the translation of it from those which
only seem to rest; for the external bodies ought not only to appear at
rest, but to be really at rest. For otherwise, all included bodies,
beside their translation from near the surrounding ones, partake
likewise of their true motions; and though that translation were not
made they would not be really at rest, but only seem to be so. For the
surrounding bodies stand in the like relation to the surrounded as the
exterior part of a whole does to the interior, or as the shell does
to the kernel; but, if the shell moves, the kernel will also move, as
being part of the whole, without any removal from near the shell.</p>

<p>A property, near akin to the preceding, is this, that if a place is
moved, whatever is placed therein moves along with it; and therefore
a body, which is moved from a place in motion, partakes also of the
motion of its place. Upon which account, all motions, from places in
motion, are no other than parts of entire and absolute motions; and
every entire motion is composed of the motion of the body out of its
first place, and the motion of this place out of its place; and so
on, until we come to some immovable place, as in the before-mentioned
example of the sailor. Wherefore, entire and absolute motions can be
no otherwise determined than by immovable places; and for that reason
I did before refer those absolute motions to immovable places, but
relative ones to movable places. Now no other places are immovable
but those that, from infinity to infinity, do all retain the same
given position one to another; and upon this account must ever remain
unmoved; and do thereby constitute immovable space.</p>

<p>The causes by which true and relative motions are distinguished, one
from the other, are the forces impressed upon bodies to generate
motion. True motion is neither generated nor altered, but by some force
impressed upon the body moved; but relative motion may be generated or
altered without any force impressed upon the body. For it is sufficient
only to impress some force on other bodies with which the former is
compared, that by their giving way, that relation may be changed, in
which the relative rest or motion of this other body did consist.
Again, true motion suffers always some change from any force impressed
upon the moving body; but relative motion does not necessarily undergo
any change by such forces. For if the same forces are likewise
impressed on those other bodies, with which the comparison is made,
that the relative position may be preserved, then that condition will
be preserved in which the relative motion consists. And therefore any
relative motion may be changed when the true motion remains unaltered,
and the relative may be preserved when the true suffers some change.
Upon which accounts, true motion does by no means consist in such
relations.</p>

<p>The effects which distinguish absolute from relative motion are, the
forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. For there are
no such forces in a circular motion purely relative, but in a true
and absolute circular motion, they are greater or less, according to
the quantity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span> motion. If a vessel, hung by a long cord, is so
often turned about that the cord is strongly twisted, then filled with
water, and held at rest together with the water; after, by the sudden
action of another force, it is whirled about the contrary way, and
while the cord is untwisting itself, the vessel continues for some
time in this motion; the surface of the water will at first be plain,
as before the vessel began to move; but the vessel, by gradually
communicating its motion to the water, will make it begin sensibly to
revolve, and recede by little and little from the middle, and ascend
to the sides of the vessel, forming itself into a concave figure (as
I have experienced), and the swifter the motion becomes, the higher
will the water rise, till at last, performing its revolutions in the
same times with the vessel, it becomes relatively at rest in it. This
ascent of the water shows its endeavour to recede from the axis of its
motion; and the true and absolute circular motion of the water, which
is here directly contrary to the relative, discovers itself, and may be
measured by this endeavour. At first, when the relative motion of the
water in the vessel was greatest, it produced no endeavour to recede
from the axis; the water showed no tendency to the circumference, nor
any ascent towards the sides of the vessel, but remained of a plain
surface, and therefore its true circular motion had not yet begun. But
afterwards, when the relative motion of the water had decreased, the
ascent thereof towards the sides of the vessel proved its endeavour
to recede from the axis; and this endeavour showed the real circular
motion of the water perpetually increasing, till it had acquired its
greatest quantity, when the water rested relatively in the vessel. And
therefore this endeavour does not depend upon any translation of the
water in respect of the ambient bodies, nor can true circular motion be
defined by such translation. There is only one real circular motion of
any one revolving body, corresponding to only one power of endeavouring
to recede from its axis of motion, as its proper and adequate effect;
but relative motions, in one and the same body, are innumerable,
according to the various relations it bears to external bodies, and
like other relations, are altogether destitute of any real effect, any
otherwise than they may perhaps partake of that one only true motion.
And therefore in their system who suppose that our heavens, revolving
below the sphere of the fixed stars, carry the planets along with them;
the several parts of those heavens, and the planets, which are indeed
relatively at rest in their heavens, do yet really move. For they
change their position one to another (which never happens to bodies
truly at rest), and being carried together with their heavens, partake
of their motions, and as parts of revolving wholes, endeavour to recede
from the axis of their motions.</p>

<p>Wherefore relative quantities are not the quantities themselves, whose
names they bear, but those sensible measures of them (either accurate
or inaccurate), which are commonly used instead of the measured
quantities themselves. And if the meaning of words is to be determined
by their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span> use, then by the names time, space, place and motion, their
measures are properly to be understood; and the expression will be
unusual, and purely mathematical, if the measured quantities themselves
are meant. Upon which account, they do strain the sacred writings, who
there interpret those words for the measured quantities. Nor do those
less defile the purity of mathematical and philosophical truths, who
confound real quantities themselves with their relations and vulgar
measures.</p>

<p>It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually
to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the
apparent; because the parts of that immovable space, in which those
motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of our
senses. Yet the thing is not altogether desperate; for we have some
arguments to guide us, partly from the apparent motions, which are the
differences of the true motions; partly from the forces, which are the
causes and effects of the true motions. For instance, if two globes,
kept at a given distance one from the other by means of a cord that
connects them, were revolved about their common centre of gravity, we
might, from the tension of the cord, discover the endeavour of the
globes to recede from the axis of their motion, and from thence we
might compute the quantity of their circular motions. And then if any
equal forces should be impressed at once on the alternate faces of the
globes to augment or diminish their circular motions, from the increase
or decrease of the tension of the cord, we might infer the increment
or decrement of their motions; and thence would be found on what faces
those forces ought to be impressed, that the motions of the globes
might be most augmented; that is, we might discover their hindermost
faces, or those which, in the circular motion, do follow. But the faces
which follow being known, and consequently the opposite ones that
precede, we should likewise know the determination of their motions.
And thus we might find both the quantity and the determination of this
circular motion, even in an immense vacuum, where there was nothing
external or sensible with which the globes could be compared. But now,
if in that space some remote bodies were placed that kept always a
given position one to another, as the fixed stars do in our regions, we
could not indeed determine from the relative translation of the globes
among those bodies, whether the motion did belong to the globes or to
the bodies. But if we observed the cord, and found that its tension was
that very tension which the motions of the globes required, we might
conclude the motion to be in the globes, and the bodies to be at rest;
and then, lastly, from the translation of the globes among the bodies,
we should find the determination of their motions. But how we are to
collect the true motions from their causes, effects, and apparent
differences; and, <i>vice versa</i>, how from the motions, either true
or apparent, we may come to the knowledge of their causes and effects,
shall be explained more at large in the following tract. For to this
end it was that I composed it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="AXIOMS_OR_LAWS_OF_MOTION">AXIOMS, OR LAWS OF MOTION.</h2>
</div>


<p class="nindc space-above2">LAW I.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in
a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed thereon.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="allsmcap">PROJECTILES</span> persevere in their
motions, so far as they are not retarded by the resistance of the air,
or impelled downwards by the force of gravity. A top, whose parts by
their cohesion are perpetually drawn aside from rectilinear motions,
does not cease its rotation, otherwise than as it is retarded by the
air. The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less
resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive
and circular for a much longer time.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">LAW II.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force
impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that
force is impressed.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If any force generates a motion, a double force will generate double
the motion, a triple force triple the motion, whether that force be
impressed altogether and at once, or gradually and successively. And
this motion (being always directed the same way with the generating
force), if the body moved before, is added to or subducted from the
former motion, according as they directly conspire with or are directly
contrary to each other; or obliquely joined, when they are oblique, so
as to produce a new motion compounded from the determination of both.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">LAW III.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the
mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and
directed to contrary parts.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that
other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also
pressed by the stone. If a horse draws a stone tied to a rope, the
horse (if I may so say) will be equally drawn back towards the stone:
for the distended rope, by the same endeavour to relax or unbend
itself, will draw the horse as much towards the stone, as it does the
stone towards the horse, and will obstruct the progress of the one as
much as it advances that of the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span> If a body impinge upon another,
and by its force change the motion of the other, that body also
(because of the equality of the mutual pressure) will undergo an equal
change, in its own motion, towards the contrary part. The changes made
by these actions are equal, not in the velocities but in the motions
of bodies; that is to say, if the bodies are not hindered by any
other impediments. For, because the motions are equally changed, the
changes of the velocities made towards contrary parts are reciprocally
proportional to the bodies. This law takes place also in attractions,
as will be proved in the next scholium.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">COROLLARY I.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>A body by two forces conjoined will describe the diagonal of a
parallelogram, in the same time that it would describe the sides, by
those forces apart.</i></p>

</figure>

<p>If a body in a given time, by the force M impressed apart in the place
A, should with an uniform motion be carried from A to B; and by the
force N impressed apart in the same place, should be carried from A
to C; complete the parallelogram ABCD, and, by both forces acting
together, it will in the same time be carried in the diagonal from
A to D. For since the force N acts in the direction of the line AC,
parallel to BD, this force (by the second law) will not at all alter
the velocity generated by the other force M, by which the body is
carried towards the line BD. The body therefore will arrive at the
line BD in the same time, whether the force N be impressed or not; and
therefore at the end of that time it will be found somewhere in the
line BD. By the same argument, at the end of the same time it will be
found somewhere in the line CD. Therefore it will be found in the point
D, where both lines meet. But it will move in a right line from A to D,
by Law I.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">COROLLARY II.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>And hence is explained the composition of any one direct force AD,
out of any two oblique forces AC and CD; and, on the contrary, the
resolution of any one direct force AD into two oblique forces AC and
CD: which composition and resolution are abundantly confirmed from
mechanics.</i></p>
</div>

<p>As if the unequal radii OM and ON drawn from the centre O of any wheel,
should sustain the weights A and P by the cords MA and NP; and the
forces of those weights to move the wheel were required. Through the
centre O draw the right line KOL, meeting the cords perpendicularly in
K and L; and from the centre O, with OL the greater of the distances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
OK and OL, describe a circle, meeting the cord MA in D: and drawing OD,
make AC parallel and DC perpendicular thereto.</p>

<p>Now, it being indifferent whether the points K, L, D, of the cords be
fixed to the plane of the wheel or not, the weights will have the same
effect whether they are suspended from the points K and L, or from
D and L. Let the whole force of the weight A be represented by the
line AD, and let it be resolved into the forces AC and CD; of which
the force AC, drawing the radius OD directly from the centre, will
have no effect to move the wheel: but the other force DC, drawing the
radius DO perpendicularly, will have the same effect as if it drew
perpendicularly the radius OL equal to OD; that is, it will have the
same effect as the weight P, if that weight is to the weight A as the
force DC is to the force DA; that is (because of the similar triangles
ADC, DOK), as OK to OD or OL. Therefore the weights A and P, which are
reciprocally as the radii OK and OL that lie in the same right line,
will be equipollent, and so remain in equilibrio; which is the well
known property of the balance, the lever, and the wheel. If either
weight is greater than in this ratio, its force to move the wheel will
be so much greater.</p>

<p>If the weight <i>p</i>, equal to the weight P, is partly suspended by
the cord N<i>p</i>, partly sustained by the oblique plane <i>p</i>G;
draw <i>p</i>H, NH, the former perpendicular to the horizon, the
latter to the plane <i>p</i>G; and if the force of the weight <i>p</i>
tending downwards is represented by the line <i>p</i>H, it may be
resolved into the forces <i>p</i>N, HN. If there was any plane
<i>p</i>Q, perpendicular to the cord <i>p</i>N, cutting the other plane
<i>p</i>G in a line parallel to the horizon, and the weight <i>p</i>
was supported only by those planes <i>p</i>Q, <i>p</i>G, it would
press those planes perpendicularly with the forces <i>p</i>N, HN;
to wit, the plane <i>p</i>Q with the force <i>p</i>N, and the plane
<i>p</i>G with the force HN. And therefore if the plane <i>p</i>Q was
taken away, so that the weight might stretch the cord, because the
cord, now sustaining the weight, supplies the place of the plane that
was removed, it will be strained by the same force <i>p</i>N which
pressed upon the plane before. Therefore, the tension of this oblique
cord <i>p</i>N will be to that of the other perpendicular cord PN as
<i>p</i>N to <i>p</i>H. And therefore if the weight <i>p</i> is to the
weight A in a ratio compounded of the reciprocal ratio of the least
distances of the cords PN, AM, from the centre of the wheel, and of the
direct ratio of <i>p</i>H to <i>p</i>N, the weights will have the same
effect towards moving the wheel and will therefore sustain each other;
as any one may find by experiment.</p>

<p>But the weight <i>p</i> pressing upon those two oblique planes, may
be considered as a wedge between the two internal surfaces of a body
split by it; and hence the forces of the wedge and the mallet may be
determined; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span> because the force with which the weight <i>p</i>
presses the plane <i>p</i>Q is to the force with which the same,
whether by its own gravity, or by the blow of a mallet, is impelled
in the direction of the line <i>p</i>H towards both the planes, as
<i>p</i>N to <i>p</i>H; and to the force with which it presses the
other plane <i>p</i>G, as <i>p</i>N to NH. And thus the force of the
screw may be deduced from a like resolution of forces; it being no
other than a wedge impelled with the force of a lever. Therefore the
use of this Corollary spreads far and wide, and by that diffusive
extent the truth thereof is farther confirmed. For on what has been
said depends the whole doctrine of mechanics variously demonstrated
by different authors. For from hence are easily deduced the forces of
machines, which are compounded of wheels, pullies, levers, cords, and
weights, ascending directly or obliquely, and other mechanical powers;
as also the force of the tendons to move the bones of animals.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The quantity of motion, which is collected by taking the sum of the
motions directed towards the same parts, and the difference of those
that are directed to contrary parts, suffers no change from the action
of bodies among themselves.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For action and its opposite re-action are equal, by Law III, and
therefore, by Law II, they produce in the motions equal changes towards
opposite parts. Therefore if the motions are directed towards the same
parts, whatever is added to the motion of the preceding body will be
subducted from the motion of that which follows; so that the sum will
be the same as before. If the bodies meet, with contrary motions, there
will be an equal deduction from the motions of both; and therefore the
difference of the motions directed towards opposite parts will remain
the same.</p>

<p>Thus if a spherical body A with two parts of velocity is triple of a
spherical body B which follows in the same right line with ten parts
of velocity, the motion of A will be to that of B as 6 to 10. Suppose,
then, their motions to be of 6 parts and of 10 parts, and the sum will
be 16 parts. Therefore, upon the meeting of the bodies, if A acquire
3, 4, or 5 parts of motion, B will lose as many; and therefore after
reflexion A will proceed with 9, 10, or 11 parts, and B with 7, 6, or
5 parts; the sum remaining always of 16 parts as before. If the body A
acquire 9, 10, 11, or 12 parts of motion, and therefore after meeting
proceed with 15, 16, 17, or 18 parts, the body B, losing so many parts
as A has got, will either proceed with 1 part, having lost 9, or stop
and remain at rest, as having lost its whole progressive motion of
10 parts; or it will go back with 1 part, having not only lost its
whole motion, but (if I may so say) one part more; or it will go back
with 2 parts, because a progressive motion of 12 parts is taken off.
And so the sums of the conspiring motions 15 + 1, or 16 + 0, and the
differences of the contrary motions 17 - 1 and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span> 18 - 2, will always be
equal to 16 parts, as they were before the meeting and reflexion of
the bodies. But, the motions being known with which the bodies proceed
after reflexion, the velocity of either will be also known, by taking
the velocity after to the velocity before reflexion, as the motion
after is to the motion before. As in the last case, where the motion
of the body A was of 6 parts before reflexion and of 18 parts after,
and the velocity was of 2 parts before reflexion, the velocity thereof
after reflexion will be found to be of 6 parts; by saying, as the 6
parts of motion before to 18 parts after, so are 2 parts of velocity
before reflexion to 6 parts after.</p>

<p>But if the bodies are either not spherical, or, moving in different
right lines, impinge obliquely one upon the other, and their motions
after reflexion are required, in those cases we are first to determine
the position of the plane that touches the concurring bodies in the
point of concourse, then the motion of each body (by Corol. II) is to
be resolved into two, one perpendicular to that plane, and the other
parallel to it. This done, because the bodies act upon each other in
the direction of a line perpendicular to this plane, the parallel
motions are to be retained the same after reflexion as before; and to
the perpendicular motions we are to assign equal changes towards the
contrary parts; in such manner that the sum of the conspiring and the
difference of the contrary motions may remain the same as before. From
such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of
bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not
consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate
every particular that relates to this subject.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">COROLLARY IV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The common centre of gravity of two or more bodies does not alter its
state of motion or rest by the actions of the bodies among themselves;
and therefore the common centre of gravity of all bodies acting upon
each other (excluding outward actions and impediments) is either at
rest, or moves uniformly in a right line.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For if two points proceed with an uniform motion in right lines, and
their distance be divided in a given ratio, the dividing point will
be either at rest, or proceed uniformly in a right line. This is
demonstrated hereafter in Lem. XXIII and its Corol., when the points
are moved in the same plane; and by a like way of arguing, it may be
demonstrated when the points are not moved in the same plane. Therefore
if any number of bodies move uniformly in right lines, the common
centre of gravity of any two of them is either at rest, or proceeds
uniformly in a right line; because the line which connects the centres
of those two bodies so moving is divided at that common centre in a
given ratio. In like manner the common centre of those two and that of
a third body will be either at rest or moving uniformly in a right line
because at that centre the distance between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span> common centre of the
two bodies, and the centre of this last, is divided in a given ratio.
In like manner the common centre of these three, and of a fourth body,
is either at rest, or moves uniformly in a right line; because the
distance between the common centre of the three bodies, and the centre
of the fourth is there also divided in a given ratio, and so on <i>in
infinitum</i>. Therefore, in a system of bodies where there is neither
any mutual action among themselves, nor any foreign force impressed
upon them from without, and which consequently move uniformly in right
lines, the common centre of gravity of them all is either at rest or
moves uniformly forward in a right line.</p>

<p>Moreover, in a system of two bodies mutually acting upon each other,
since the distances between their centres and the common centre of
gravity of both are reciprocally as the bodies, the relative motions
of those bodies, whether of approaching to or of receding from that
centre, will be equal among themselves. Therefore since the changes
which happen to motions are equal and directed to contrary parts,
the common centre of those bodies, by their mutual action between
themselves, is neither promoted nor retarded, nor suffers any change
as to its state of motion or rest. But in a system of several bodies,
because the common centre of gravity of any two acting mutually upon
each other suffers no change in its state by that action; and much less
the common centre of gravity of the others with which that action does
not intervene; but the distance between those two centres is divided by
the common centre of gravity of all the bodies into parts reciprocally
proportional to the total sums of those bodies whose centres they are;
and therefore while those two centres retain their state of motion
or rest, the common centre of all does also retain its state: it is
manifest that the common centre of all never suffers any change in the
state of its motion or rest from the actions of any two bodies between
themselves. But in such a system all the actions of the bodies among
themselves either happen between two bodies, or are composed of actions
interchanged between some two bodies; and therefore they do never
produce any alteration in the common centre of all as to its state of
motion or rest. Wherefore since that centre, when the bodies do not act
mutually one upon another, either is at rest or moves uniformly forward
in some right line, it will, notwithstanding the mutual actions of the
bodies among themselves, always persevere in its state, either of rest,
or of proceeding uniformly in a right line, unless it is forced out
of this state by the action of some power impressed from without upon
the whole system. And therefore the same law takes place in a system
consisting of many bodies as in one single body, with regard to their
persevering in their state of motion or of rest. For the progressive
motion, whether of one single body, or of a whole system of bodies is
always to be estimated from the motion of the centre of gravity.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">COROLLARY V.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The motions of bodies included in a given space are the same among
themselves, whether that space is at rest, or moves uniformly forwards
in a right line without any circular motion.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For the differences of the motions tending towards the same parts, and
the sums of those that tend towards contrary parts, are, at first (by
supposition), in both cases the same; and it is from those sums and
differences that the collisions and impulses do arise with which the
bodies mutually impinge one upon another. Wherefore (by Law II), the
effects of those collisions will be equal in both cases; and therefore
the mutual motions of the bodies among themselves in the one case will
remain equal to the mutual motions of the bodies among themselves in
the other. A clear proof of which we have from the experiment of a
ship; where all motions happen after the same manner, whether the ship
is at rest, or is carried uniformly forwards in a right line.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">COROLLARY VI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If bodies, any how moved among themselves, are urged in the
direction of parallel lines by equal accelerative forces, they will all
continue to move among themselves, after the same manner as if they had
been urged by no such forces.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For these forces acting equally (with respect to the quantities of the
bodies to be moved), and in the direction of parallel lines, will (by
Law II) move all the bodies equally (as to velocity), and therefore
will never produce any change in the positions or motions of the bodies
among themselves.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>Hitherto I have laid down such principles as have been received by
mathematicians, and are confirmed by abundance of experiments. By
the first two Laws and the first two Corollaries, Galileo discovered
that the descent of bodies observed the duplicate ratio of the time,
and that the motion of projectiles was in the curve of a parabola;
experience agreeing with both, unless so far as these motions are a
little retarded by the resistance of the air. When a body is falling,
the uniform force of its gravity acting equally, impresses, in equal
particles of time, equal forces upon that body, and therefore generates
equal velocities; and in the whole time impresses a whole force, and
generates a whole velocity proportional to the time. And the spaces
described in proportional times are as the velocities and the times
conjunctly; that is, in a duplicate ratio of the times. And when a body
is thrown upwards, its uniform gravity impresses forces and takes off
velocities proportional to the times; and the times of ascending to
the greatest heights are as the velocities to be taken off, and those
heights are as the velocities and the times conjunctly, or in the
duplicate ratio of the velocities. And if a body be projected in any
direction, the motion arising from its projection is compounded with
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span> motion arising from its gravity.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_090a">
<img alt="If a body be projected in any direction, the motion arising from its projection is compounded with the motion arising from its gravity." height="251" src="images/i_090a.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_090a.jpg">
</figure>

<p class="nind">
As if the body A by its motion of projection alone could describe
in a given time the right line AB, and with its motion of falling
alone could describe in the same time the altitude AC; complete the
parallelogram ABDC, and the body by that compounded motion will at the
end of the time be found in the place D; and the curve line AED, which
that body describes, will be a parabola, to which the right line AB
will be a tangent in A; and whose ordinate BD will be as the square
of the line AB. On the same Laws and Corollaries depend those things
which have been demonstrated concerning the times of the vibration
of pendulums, and are confirmed by the daily experiments of pendulum
clocks. By the same, together with the third Law, Sir Christ. Wren,
Dr. Wallis, and Mr. Huygens, the greatest geometers of our times, did
severally determine the rules of the congress and reflexion of hard
bodies, and much about the same time communicated their discoveries
to the Royal Society, exactly agreeing among themselves as to those
rules. Dr. Wallis, indeed, was something more early in the publication;
then followed Sir Christopher Wren, and, lastly, Mr. Huygens. But Sir
Christopher Wren confirmed the truth of the thing before the Royal
Society by the experiment of pendulums, which Mr. Mariotte soon after
thought fit to explain in a treatise entirely upon that subject. But
to bring this experiment to an accurate agreement with the theory, we
are to have a due regard as well to the resistance of the air as to the
elastic force of the concurring bodies.</p>

<p class="nind">
Let the spherical bodies A, B be suspended by the parallel and equal
strings AC, BD, from the centres C, D. About these centres, with those
intervals, describe the semicircles EAF, GBH, bisected by the radii CA,
DB. Bring the body A to any point R of the arc EAF, and (withdrawing
the body B) let it go from thence, and after one oscillation suppose
it to return to the point V: then RV will be the retardation arising
from the resistance of the air. Of this RV let ST be a fourth part,
situated in the middle, to wit, so as RS and TV may be equal, and
RS may be to ST as 3 to 2 then will ST represent very nearly the
retardation during the descent from S to A. Restore the body B to its
place: and, supposing the body A to be let fall from the point S, the
velocity thereof in the place of reflexion A, without sensible error,
will be the same as if it had descended <i>in vacuo</i> from the point
T. Upon which account this velocity may be represented by the chord
of the arc TA. For it is a proposition well known to geometers, that
the velocity of a pendulous body in the lowest point is as the chord
of the arc which it has described in its descent. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span> reflexion,
suppose the body A comes to the place <i>s</i>, and the body B to the
place <i>k</i>. Withdraw the body B, and find the place <i>v</i>, from
which if the body A, being let go, should after one oscillation return
to the place <i>r</i>, <i>st</i> may be a fourth part of <i>rv</i>, so
placed in the middle thereof as to leave <i>rs</i> equal to <i>tv</i>,
and let the chord of the arc <i>t</i>A represent the velocity which the
body A had in the place A immediately after reflexion. For <i>t</i>
will be the true and correct place to which the body A should have
ascended, if the resistance of the air had been taken off. In the same
way we are to correct the place <i>k</i> to which the body B ascends,
by finding the place <i>l</i> to which it should have ascended <i>in
vacuo</i>. And thus everything may be subjected to experiment, in the
same manner as if we were really placed <i>in vacuo</i>. These things
being done, we are to take the product (if I may so say) of the body
A, by the chord of the arc TA (which represents its velocity), that we
may have its motion in the place A immediately before reflexion; and
then by the chord of the arc <i>t</i>A, that we may have its motion
in the place A immediately after reflexion. And so we are to take the
product of the body B by the chord of the arc B<i>l</i>, that we may
have the motion of the same immediately after reflexion. And in like
manner, when two bodies are let go together from different places, we
are to find the motion of each, as well before as after reflexion; and
then we may compare the motions between themselves, and collect the
effects of the reflexion. Thus trying the thing with pendulums of ten
feet, in unequal as well as equal bodies, and making the bodies to
concur after a descent through large spaces, as of 8, 12, or 16 feet,
I found always, without an error of 3 inches, that when the bodies
concurred together directly, equal changes towards the contrary parts
were produced in their motions, and, of consequence, that the action
and reaction were always equal. As if the body A impinged upon the
body B at rest with 9 parts of motion, and losing 7, proceeded after
reflexion with 2, the body B was carried backwards with those 7 parts.
If the bodies concurred with contrary motions, A with twelve parts
of motion, and B with six, then if A receded with 2, B receded with
8; to wit, with a deduction of 14 parts of motion on each side. For
from the motion of A subducting twelve parts, nothing will remain;
but subducting 2 parts more, a motion will be generated of 2 parts
towards the contrary way; and so, from the motion of the body B of 6
parts, subducting 14 parts, a motion is generated of 8 parts towards
the contrary way. But if the bodies were made both to move towards the
same way, A, the swifter, with 14 parts of motion, B, the slower, with
5, and after reflexion A went on with 5, B likewise went on with 14
parts; 9 parts being transferred from A to B. And so in other cases. By
the congress and collision of bodies, the quantity of motion, collected
from the sum of the motions directed towards the same way, or from the
difference of those that were directed towards contrary ways, was never
changed. For the error of an inch or two in measures may be easily
ascribed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span> difficulty of executing everything with accuracy. It
was not easy to let go the two pendulums so exactly together that the
bodies should impinge one upon the other in the lowermost place AB; nor
to mark the places <i>s</i>, and <i>k</i>, to which the bodies ascended
after congress. Nay, and some errors, too, might have happened from the
unequal density of the parts of the pendulous bodies themselves, and
from the irregularity of the texture proceeding from other causes.</p>

<p>But to prevent an objection that may perhaps be alledged against the
rule, for the proof of which this experiment was made, as if this
rule did suppose that the bodies were either absolutely hard, or at
least perfectly elastic (whereas no such bodies are to be found in
nature), I must add, that the experiments we have been describing, by
no means depending upon that quality of hardness, do succeed as well
in soft as in hard bodies. For if the rule is to be tried in bodies
not perfectly hard, we are only to diminish the reflexion in such a
certain proportion as the quantity of the elastic force requires. By
the theory of Wren and Huygens, bodies absolutely hard return one from
another with the same velocity with which they meet. But this may be
affirmed with more certainty of bodies perfectly elastic. In bodies
imperfectly elastic the velocity of the return is to be diminished
together with the elastic force; because that force (except when the
parts of bodies are bruised by their congress, or suffer some such
extension as happens under the strokes of a hammer) is (as far as I can
perceive) certain and determined, and makes the bodies to return one
from the other with a relative velocity, which is in a given ratio to
that relative velocity with which they met. This I tried in balls of
wool, made up tightly, and strongly compressed. For, first, by letting
go the pendulous bodies, and measuring their reflexion, I determined
the quantity of their elastic force; and then, according to this
force, estimated the reflexions that ought to happen in other cases of
congress. And with this computation other experiments made afterwards
did accordingly agree; the balls always receding one from the other
with a relative velocity, which was to the relative velocity with which
they met as about 5 to 9. Balls of steel returned with almost the same
velocity: those of cork with a velocity something less; but in balls
of glass the proportion was as about 15 to 16. And thus the third Law,
so far as it regards percussions and reflexions, is proved by a theory
exactly agreeing with experience.</p>

<p>In attractions, I briefly demonstrate the thing after this manner.
Suppose an obstacle is interposed to hinder the congress of any two
bodies A, B, mutually attracting one the other: then if either body, as
A, is more attracted towards the other body B, than that other body B
is towards the first body A, the obstacle will be more strongly urged
by the pressure of the body A than by the pressure of the body B, and
therefore will not remain in equilibrio: but the stronger pressure will
prevail, and will make the system of the two bodies, together with
the obstacle, to move directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span> towards the parts on which B lies;
and in free spaces, to go forward <i>in infinitum</i> with a motion
perpetually accelerated; which is absurd and contrary to the first Law.
For, by the first Law, the system ought to persevere in its state of
rest, or of moving uniformly forward in a right line; and therefore the
bodies must equally press the obstacle, and be equally attracted one by
the other. I made the experiment on the loadstone and iron. If these,
placed apart in proper vessels, are made to float by one another in
standing water, neither of them will propel the other; but, by being
equally attracted, they will sustain each other's pressure, and rest at
last in an equilibrium.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_093">
<img alt="The gravitation betwixt the earth and its parts is mutual." height="189" src="images/i_093.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_093.jpg"> </figure>

<p>So the gravitation betwixt the earth and its parts is mutual. Let the
earth FI be cut by any plane EG into two parts EGF and EGI, and their
weights one towards the other will be mutually equal. For if by another
plane HK, parallel to the former EG, the greater part EGI is cut into
two parts EGKH and HKI, whereof HKI is equal to the part EFG, first cut
off, it is evident that the middle part EGKH, will have no propension
by its proper weight towards either side, but will hang as it were, and
rest in an equilibrium betwixt both. But the one extreme part HKI will
with its whole weight bear upon and press the middle part towards the
other extreme part EGF; and therefore the force with which EGI, the sum
of the parts HKI and EGKH, tends towards the third part EGF, is equal
to the weight of the part HKI, that is, to the weight of the third
part EGF. And therefore the weights of the two parts EGI and EGF, one
towards the other, are equal, as I was to prove. And indeed if those
weights were not equal, the whole earth floating in the non-resisting
æther would give way to the greater weight, and, retiring from it,
would be carried off <i>in infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>And as those bodies are equipollent in the congress and reflexion,
whose velocities are reciprocally as their innate forces, so in
the use of mechanic instruments those agents are equipollent, and
mutually sustain each the contrary pressure of the other, whose
velocities, estimated according to the determination of the forces, are
reciprocally as the forces.</p>

<p>So those weights are of equal force to move the arms of a balance;
which during the play of the balance are reciprocally as their
velocities upwards and downwards; that is, if the ascent or descent
is direct, those weights are of equal force, which are reciprocally
as the distances of the points at which they are suspended from the
axis of the balance; but if they are turned aside by the interposition
of oblique planes, or other obstacles, and made to ascend or descend
obliquely, those bodies will be equipollent, which are reciprocally
as the heights of their ascent and descent taken according to the
perpendicular; and that on account of the determination of gravity
downwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>And in like manner in the pully, or in a combination of pullies, the
force of a hand drawing the rope directly, which is to the weight,
whether ascending directly or obliquely, as the velocity of the
perpendicular ascent of the weight to the velocity of the hand that
draws the rope, will sustain the weight.</p>

<p>In clocks and such like instruments, made up from a combination of
wheels, the contrary forces that promote and impede the motion of the
wheels, if they are reciprocally as the velocities of the parts of the
wheel on which they are impressed, will mutually sustain the one the
other.</p>

<p>The force of the screw to press a body is to the force of the hand
that turns the handles by which it is moved as the circular velocity
of the handle in that part where it is impelled by the hand is to the
progressive velocity of the screw towards the pressed body.</p>

<p>The forces by which the wedge presses or drives the two parts of the
wood it cleaves are to the force of the mallet upon the wedge as the
progress of the wedge in the direction of the force impressed upon it
by the mallet is to the velocity with which the parts of the wood yield
to the wedge, in the direction of lines perpendicular to the sides of
the wedge. And the like account is to be given of all machines.</p>

<p>The power and use of machines consist only in this, that by diminishing
the velocity we may augment the force, and the contrary: from whence
in all sorts of proper machines, we have the solution of this
problem; <i>To move a given weight with a given power</i>, or with a
given force to overcome any other given resistance. For if machines
are so contrived that the velocities of the agent and resistant
are reciprocally as their forces, the agent will just sustain the
resistant, but with a greater disparity of velocity will overcome it.
So that if the disparity of velocities is so great as to overcome all
that resistance which commonly arises either from the attrition of
contiguous bodies as they slide by one another, or from the cohesion
of continuous bodies that are to be separated, or from the weights
of bodies to be raised, the excess of the force remaining, after all
those resistances are overcome, will produce an acceleration of motion
proportional thereto, as well in the parts of the machine as in the
resisting body. But to treat of mechanics is not my present business.
I was only willing to show by those examples the great extent and
certainty of the third Law of motion. For if we estimate the action
of the agent from its force and velocity conjunctly, and likewise
the reaction of the impediment conjunctly from the velocities of its
several parts, and from the forces of resistance arising from the
attrition, cohesion, weight, and acceleration of those parts, the
action and reaction in the use of all sorts of machines will be found
always equal to one another. And so far as the action is propagated by
the intervening instruments, and at last impressed upon the resisting
body, the ultimate determination of the action will be always contrary
to the determination of the reaction.</p>

<p>Those things which have been demonstrated of curve lines, and the
superfices which they comprehend, may be easily applied to the curve
superfices and contents of solids. These Lemmas are premised to
avoid the tediousness of deducing perplexed demonstrations <i>ad
absurdum</i>, according to the method of the ancient geometers. For
demonstrations are more contracted by the method of indivisibles:
but because the hypothesis of indivisibles seems somewhat harsh, and
therefore that method is reckoned less geometrical, I chose rather
to reduce the demonstrations of the following propositions to the
first and last sums and ratios of nascent and evanescent quantities,
that is, to the limits of those sums and ratios; and so to premise,
as short as I could, the demonstrations of those limits. For hereby
the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles; and
now those principles being demonstrated, we may use them with more
safety. Therefore if hereafter I should happen to consider quantities
as made up of particles, or should use little curve lines for right
ones, I would not be understood to mean indivisibles, but evanescent
divisible quantities; not the sums and ratios of determinate parts,
but always the limits of sums and ratios; and that the force of such
demonstrations always depends on the method laid down in the foregoing
Lemmas.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be objected, that there is no ultimate proportion, of
evanescent quantities; because the proportion, before the quantities
have vanished, is not the ultimate, and when they are vanished, is
none. But by the same argument, it may be alledged, that a body
arriving at a certain place, and there stopping, has no ultimate
velocity: because the velocity, before the body comes to the place,
is not its ultimate velocity; when it has arrived, is none. But the
answer is easy; for by the ultimate velocity, is meant that with which
the body is moved, neither before it arrives at its last place and the
motion ceases, nor after, but at the very instant it arrives; that is,
that velocity with which the body arrives at its last place, and with
which the motion ceases. And in like manner, by the ultimate ratio of
evanescent quantities is to be understood the ratio of the quantities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
not before they vanish, nor afterwards, but with which they vanish. In
like manner the first ratio of nascent quantities is that with which
they begin to be. And the first or last sum is that with which they
begin and cease to be (or to be augmented or diminished). There is a
limit which the velocity at the end of the motion may attain, but not
exceed. This is the ultimate velocity. And there is the like limit
in all quantities and proportions that begin and cease to be. And
since such limits are certain and definite, to determine the same is
a problem strictly geometrical. But whatever is geometrical we may be
allowed to use in determining and demonstrating any other thing that is
likewise geometrical.</p>

<p>It may also be objected, that if the ultimate ratios of evanescent
quantities are given, their ultimate magnitudes will be also given:
and so all quantities will consist of indivisibles, which is contrary
to what <i>Euclid</i> has demonstrated concerning incommensurables, in
the 10th Book of his Elements. But this objection is founded on a false
supposition. For those ultimate ratios with which quantities vanish are
not truly the ratios of ultimate quantities, but limits towards which
the ratios of quantities decreasing without limit do always converge;
and to which they approach nearer than by any given difference, but
never go beyond, nor in effect attain to, till the quantities are
diminished <i>in infinitum</i>. This thing will appear more evident
in quantities infinitely great. If two quantities, whose difference
is given, be augmented <i>in infinitum</i>, the ultimate ratio of
these quantities will be given, to wit, the ratio of equality; but it
does not from thence follow, that the ultimate or greatest quantities
themselves, whose ratio that is, will be given. Therefore if in what
follows, for the sake of being more easily understood, I should happen
to mention quantities as least, or evanescent, or ultimate, you are not
to suppose that quantities of any determinate magnitude are meant, but
such as are conceived to be always diminished without end.</p>

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION I. THEOREM I.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The areas, which revolving bodies describe by radii drawn to an
immovable centre of force do lie in the same immovable planes, and are
proportional to the times in which they are described.</i></p>
</div>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_104">
<img alt="The areas, which revolving bodies describe by radii drawn to an immovable centre of force do lie in the same immovable planes, and are proportional to the times in which they are described." height="204" src="images/i_104.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_104.jpg"></figure>

<p>For suppose the time to be divided into equal parts, and in the first
part of that time let the body by its innate force describe the right
line AB. In the second part of that time, the same would (by Law I.),
if not hindered, proceed directly to <i>c</i>, along the line B<i>c</i>
equal to AB; so that by the radii AS, BS, <i>c</i>S, drawn to the
centre, the equal areas ASB, BS<i>c</i>, would be described.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span> But when
the body is arrived at B, suppose that a centripetal force acts at once
with a great impulse, and, turning aside the body from the right line
B<i>c</i>, compels it afterwards to continue its motion along the right
line BC. Draw <i>c</i>C parallel to BS meeting BC in C; and at the
end of the second part of the time, the body (by Cor. 1. of the Laws)
will be found in C, in the same plane with the triangle ASB. Join SC,
and, because SB and C<i>c</i> are parallel, the triangle SBC will be
equal to the triangle SB<i>c</i>, and therefore also to the triangle
SAB. By the like argument, if the centripetal force acts successively
in C, D, E, &amp;c., and makes the body, in each single particle of time,
to describe the right lines CD, DE, EF, &amp;c., they will all lie in the
same plane; and the triangle SCD will be equal to the triangle SBC,
and SDE to SCD, and SEF to SDE. And therefore, in equal times, equal
areas are described in one immovable plane: and, by composition, any
sums SADS, SAFS, of those areas, are one to the other as the times in
which they are described. Now let the number of those triangles be
augmented, and their breadth diminished <i>in infinitum</i>; and (by
Cor. 4, Lem. III.) their ultimate perimeter ADF will be a curve line:
and therefore the centripetal force, by which the body is perpetually
drawn back from the tangent of this curve, will act continually; and
any described areas SADS, SAFS, which are always proportional to the
times of description, will, in this case also, be proportional to those
times. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. The velocity of a body attracted towards an immovable centre,
in spaces void of resistance, is reciprocally as the perpendicular let
fall from that centre on the right line that touches the orbit. For the
velocities in those places A, B, C, D, E, are as the bases AB, BC, CD,
DE, EF, of equal triangles; and these bases are reciprocally as the
perpendiculars let fall upon them.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If the chords AB, BC of two arcs, successively described
in equal times by the same body, in spaces void of resistance, are
completed into a parallelogram ABCV, and the diagonal BV of this
parallelogram, in the position which it ultimately acquires when those
arcs are diminished <i>in infinitum</i>, is produced both ways, it will
pass through the centre of force.</p>

<p>COR. 3. If the chords AB, BC, and DE, EF, of arcs described in
equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span> times, in spaces void of resistance, are completed into the
parallelograms ABCV, DEFZ; the forces in B and E are one to the other
in the ultimate ratio of the diagonals BV, EZ, when those arcs are
diminished <i>in infinitum</i>. For the motions BC and EF of the body
(by Cor. 1 of the Laws) are compounded of the motions B<i>c</i>, BV,
and E<i>f</i>, EZ: but BV and EZ, which are equal to C<i>c</i> and
F<i>f</i>, in the demonstration of this Proposition, were generated by
the impulses of the centripetal force in B and E, and are therefore
proportional to those impulses.</p>

<p>COR. 4. The forces by which bodies, in spaces void of resistance,
are drawn back from rectilinear motions, and turned into curvilinear
orbits, are one to another as the versed sines of arcs described in
equal times; which versed sines tend to the centre of force, and bisect
the chords when those arcs are diminished to infinity. For such versed
sines are the halves of the diagonals mentioned in Cor. 3.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And therefore those forces are to the force of gravity as the
said versed sines to the versed sines perpendicular to the horizon of
those parabolic arcs which projectiles describe in the same time.</p>

<p>COR. 6. And the same things do all hold good (by Cor. 5 of the Laws),
when the planes in which the bodies are moved, together with the
centres of force which are placed in those planes, are not at rest, but
move uniformly forward in right lines.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION II. THEOREM II.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Every body that moves in any curve line described in a plane, and
by a radius, drawn to a point either immovable, or moving forward
with an uniform rectilinear motion, describes about that point areas
proportional to the times, is urged by a centripetal force directed to
that point.</i></p>
</div>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_105">
<img alt="Any body moving in a plane curve that sweeps out areas proportional to time around a point is acted on by a centripetal force toward that point." height="201" src="images/i_105.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_105.jpg">
</figure>

<p>CASE. 1. For every body that moves in a curve line, is (by Law I)
turned aside from its rectilinear course by the action of some force
that impels it. And that force by which the body is turned off from
its rectilinear course, and is made to describe, in equal times, the
equal least triangles SAB, SBC, SCD, &amp;c., about the immovable point
S (by Prop. XL. Book I, Elem. and Law II), acts in the place B,
according to the direction of a line parallel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span> to <i>c</i>C, that is,
in the direction of the line BS, and in the place C, according to the
direction of a line parallel to <i>d</i>D, that is, in the direction of
the line CS, &amp;c.; and therefore acts always in the direction of lines
tending to the immovable point S. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE. 2. And (by Cor. 5 of the Laws) it is indifferent whether the
superfices in which a body describes a curvilinear figure be quiescent,
or moves together with the body, the figure described, and its point S,
uniformly forward in right lines.</p>

<p>COR. 1. In non-resisting spaces or mediums, if the areas are not
proportional to the times, the forces are not directed to the point in
which the radii meet; but deviate therefrom <i>in consequentia</i>, or
towards the parts to which the motion is directed, if the description
of the areas is accelerated; but <i>in antecedentia</i>, if retarded.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And even in resisting mediums, if the description of the areas
is accelerated, the directions of the forces deviate from the point in
which the radii meet, towards the parts to which the motion tends.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>A body may be urged by a centripetal force compounded of several
forces; in which case the meaning of the Proposition is, that the force
which results out of all tends to the point S. But if any force acts
perpetually in the direction of lines perpendicular to the described
surface, this force will make the body to deviate from the plane of
its motion: but will neither augment nor diminish the quantity of the
described surface, and is therefore to be neglected in the composition
of forces.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION III. THEOREM III.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Every body, that by a radius drawn to the centre of another body,
howsoever moved, describes areas about that centre proportional to the
times, is urged by a force compounded out of the centripetal force
tending to that other body, and of all the accelerative force by which
that other body is impelled.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Let L represent the one, and T the other body; and (by Cor. 6 of the
Laws) if both bodies are urged in the direction of parallel lines, by
a new force equal and contrary to that by which the second body T is
urged, the first body L will go on to describe about the other body
T the same areas as before: but the force by which that other body T
was urged will be now destroyed by an equal and contrary force; and
therefore (by Law I.) that other body T, now left to itself, will
either rest, or move uniformly forward in a right line: and the first
body L impelled by the difference of the forces, that is, by the
force remaining, will go on to describe about the other body T areas
proportional to the times. And therefore (by Theor. II.) the difference
of the forces is directed to the other body T as its centre. Q.E.D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if the one body L, by a radius drawn to the other body T,
describes areas proportional to the times; and from the whole force,
by which the first body L is urged (whether that force is simple, or,
according to Cor. 2 of the Laws, compounded out of several forces), we
subduct (by the same Cor.) that whole accelerative force by which the
other body is urged; the whole remaining force by which the first body
is urged will tend to the other body T, as its centre.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And, if these areas are proportional to the times nearly, the
remaining force will tend to the other body T nearly.</p>

<p>COR. 3. And <i>vice versa</i>, if the remaining force tends nearly to
the other body T, those areas will be nearly proportional to the times.</p>

<p>COR. 4. If the body L, by a radius drawn to the other body T, describes
areas, which, compared with the times, are very unequal; and that other
body T be either at rest, or moves uniformly forward in a right line:
the action of the centripetal force tending to that other body T is
either none at all, or it is mixed and compounded with very powerful
actions of other forces: and the whole force compounded of them all, if
they are many, is directed to another (immovable or moveable) centre.
The same thing obtains, when the other body is moved by any motion
whatsoever; provided that centripetal force is taken, which remains
after subducting that whole force acting upon that other body T.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>Because the equable description of areas indicates that a centre is
respected by that force with which the body is most affected, and by
which it is drawn back from its rectilinear motion, and retained in its
orbit; why may we not be allowed, in the following discourse, to use
the equable description of areas as an indication of a centre, about
which all circular motion is performed in free spaces?</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION IV. THEOREM IV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The centripetal forces of bodies, which by equable motions describe
different circles, tend to the centres of the same circles; and are
one to the other as the squares of the arcs described in equal times
applied to the radii of the circles.</i></p>
</div>

<p>These forces tend to the centres of the circles (by Prop. II., and Cor.
2, Prop. I.), and are one to another as the versed sines of the least
arcs described in equal times (by Cor. 4, Prop. I.); that is, as the
squares of the same arcs applied to the diameters of the circles (by
Lem. VII.); and therefore since those arcs are as arcs described in any
equal times, and the diameters are as the radii, the forces will be as
the squares of any arcs described in the same time applied to the radii
of the circles. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore, since those arcs are as the velocities of the
bodies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span> the centripetal forces are in a ratio compounded of the
duplicate ratio of the velocities directly, and of the simple ratio of
the radii inversely.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And since the periodic times are in a ratio compounded of the
ratio of the radii directly, and the ratio of the velocities inversely,
the centripetal forces, are in a ratio compounded of the ratio of the
radii directly, and the duplicate ratio of the periodic times inversely.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Whence if the periodic times are equal, and the velocities
therefore as the radii, the centripetal forces will be also as the
radii; and the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 4. If the periodic times and the velocities are both in the
subduplicate ratio of the radii, the centripetal forces will be equal
among themselves; and the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 5. If the periodic times are as the radii, and therefore the
velocities equal, the centripetal forces will be reciprocally as the
radii; and the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 6. If the periodic times are in the sesquiplicate ratio of the
radii, and therefore the velocities reciprocally in the subduplicate
ratio of the radii, the centripetal forces will be in the duplicate
ratio of the radii inversely; and the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 7. And universally, if the periodic time is as any power R<sup>n</sup> of
the radius R, and therefore the velocity reciprocally as the power
<img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{R}^{n - 1}" src="images/28.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 4.857ex; height: 1.937ex;" id="img_images_28.svg"> of the radius, the centripetal force will be
reciprocally as the power <img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{R}^{2n - 1}" src="images/29.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 5.657ex; height: 1.937ex;" id="img_images_29.svg"> of the radius; and
the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 8. The same things all hold concerning the times, the velocities,
and forces by which bodies describe the similar parts of any similar
figures that have their centres in a similar position with those
figures; as appears by applying the demonstration of the preceding
cases to those. And the application is easy, by only substituting the
equable description of areas in the place of equable motion, and using
the distances of the bodies from the centres instead of the radii.</p>

<p>COR. 9. From the same demonstration it likewise follows, that the arc
which a body, uniformly revolving in a circle by means of a given
centripetal force, describes in any time, is a mean proportional
between the diameter of the circle, and the space which the same body
falling by the same given force would descend through in the same given
time.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>The case of the 6th Corollary obtains in the celestial bodies (as Sir
Christopher Wren, Dr. Hooke, and Dr. Halley have severally observed);
and therefore in what follows, I intend to treat more at large of those
things which relate to centripetal force decreasing in a duplicate
ratio of the distances from the centres.</p>

<p>Moreover, by means of the preceding Proposition and its Corollaries,
we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span> may discover the proportion of a centripetal force to any other
known force, such as that of gravity. For if a body by means of its
gravity revolves in a circle concentric to the earth, this gravity
is the centripetal force of that body. But from the descent of
heavy bodies, the time of one entire revolution, as well as the arc
described in any given time, is given (by Cor. 9 of this Prop.).
And by such propositions, Mr. Huygens, in his excellent book <i>De
Horologio Oscillatorio</i>, has compared the force of gravity with the
centrifugal forces of revolving bodies.</p>

<p>The preceding Proposition may be likewise demonstrated after this
manner. In any circle suppose a polygon to be inscribed of any number
of sides. And if a body, moved with a given velocity along the sides
of the polygon, is reflected from the circle at the several angular
points, the force, with which at every reflection it strikes the
circle, will be as its velocity: and therefore the sum of the forces,
in a given time, will be as that velocity and the number of reflections
conjunctly; that is (if the species of the polygon be given), as the
length described in that given time, and increased or diminished in the
ratio of the same length to the radius of the circle; that is, as the
square of that length applied to the radius; and therefore the polygon,
by having its sides diminished <i>in infinitum</i>, coincides with the
circle, as the square of the arc described in a given time applied to
the radius. This is the centrifugal force, with which the body impels
the circle; and to which the contrary force, wherewith the circle
continually repels the body towards the centre, is equal.</p>

distance, the body will move in an ellipsis whose centre coincides with
the centre of force, or perhaps in a circle into which the ellipsis may
degenerate.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And the periodic times of the revolutions made in all ellipses
whatsoever about the same centre will be equal. For those times in
similar ellipses will be equal (by Corol. 3 and 8, Prop. IV); but in
ellipses that have their greater axis common, they are one to another
as the whole areas of the ellipses directly, and the parts of the areas
described in the same time inversely; that is, as the lesser axes
directly, and the velocities of the bodies in their principal vertices
inversely; that is, as those lesser axes directly, and the ordinates to
the same point of the common axes inversely; and therefore (because of
the equality of the direct and inverse ratios) in the ratio of equality.</p>

<p>If the ellipsis, by having its centre removed to an infinite distance,
degenerates into a parabola, the body will move in this parabola; and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> force, now tending to a centre infinitely remote, will become
equable. Which is <i>Galileo's</i> theorem. And if the parabolic
section of the cone (by changing the inclination of the cutting plane
to the cone) degenerates into an hyperbola, the body will move in the
perimeter of this hyperbola, having its centripetal force changed
into a centrifugal force. And in like manner as in the circle, or in
the ellipsis, if the forces are directed to the centre of the figure
placed in the abscissa, those forces by increasing or diminishing the
ordinates in any given ratio, or even by changing the angle of the
inclination of the ordinates to the abscissa, are always augmented or
diminished in the ratio of the distances from the centre; provided the
periodic times remain equal; so also in all figures whatsoever, if the
ordinates are augmented or diminished in any given ratio, or their
inclination is any way changed, the periodic time remaining the same,
the forces directed to any centre placed in the abscissa are in the
several ordinates augmented or diminished in the ratio of the distances
from the centre.</p>

force that is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance
of the places from the centre, the body will move in one of the conic

For the focus, the point of contact, and the position of the tangent,
being given, a conic section may be described, which at that point
shall have a given curvature. But the curvature is given from the

For the perpendiculars are now the lesser semi-axes, and these are as
mean proportionals between the distances and the latera recta. Let
this ratio inversely be compounded with the subduplicate ratio of the

<p>COR. 5. In the same figure, or even in different figures, whose
principal latera recta are equal, the velocity of a body is
reciprocally as the perpendicular let fall from the focus on the
tangent.</p>

<p>COR. 6. In a parabola, the velocity is reciprocally in the subduplicate
ratio of the distance of the body from the focus of the figure; it
is more variable in the ellipsis, and less in the hyperbola, than
according to this ratio. For (by Cor. 2, Lem. XIV) the perpendicular
let fall from the focus on the tangent of a parabola is in the
subduplicate ratio of the distance. In the hyperbola the perpendicular
is less variable; in the ellipsis more.</p>

<p>COR. 7. In a parabola, the velocity of a body at any distance from the
focus is to the velocity of a body revolving in a circle, at the same
distance from the centre, in the subduplicate ratio of the number 2
to 1; in the ellipsis it is less, and in the hyperbola greater, than
according to this ratio. For (by Cor. 2 of this Prop.) the velocity
at the vertex of a parabola is in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span> this ratio, and (by Cor. 6 of this
Prop. and Prop. IV) the same proportion holds in all distances. And
hence, also, in a parabola, the velocity is everywhere equal to the
velocity of a body revolving in a circle at half the distance; in the
ellipsis it is less, and in the hyperbola greater.</p>

<p>COR. 8. The velocity of a body revolving in any conic section is to
the velocity of a body revolving in a circle, at the distance of half
the principal latus rectum of the section, as that distance to the
perpendicular let fall from the focus on the tangent of the section.
This appears from Cor. 5.</p>

<p>COR. 9. Wherefore since (by Cor. 6, Prop. IV), the velocity of a body
revolving in this circle is to the velocity of another body revolving
in any other circle reciprocally in the subduplicate ratio of the
distances; therefore, <i>ex æquo</i>, the velocity of a body revolving
in a conic section will be to the velocity of a body revolving in a
circle at the same distance as a mean proportional between that common
distance, and half the principal latus rectum of the section, to the

to L. Whence PH is given both in length and position. That is, if the
velocity of the body in P is such that the latus rectum L is less than
2SP + 2KP, PH will lie on the same side of the tangent PR with the
line SP; and therefore the figure will be an ellipsis, which from the
given foci S, H, and the principal axis SP + PH, is given also. But if
the velocity of the body is so great, that the latus rectum L becomes
equal to 2SP + 2KP, the length PH will be infinite; and therefore, the
figure will be a parabola, which has its axis SH parallel to the line
PK, and is thence given. But if the body goes from its place P with a
yet greater velocity, the length PH is to be taken on the other side
the tangent; and so the tangent passing between the foci, the figure
will be an hyperbola having its principal axis equal to the difference
of the lines SP and PH, and thence is given. For if the body, in
these cases, revolves in a conic section so found, it is demonstrated
in Prop. XI, XII, and XIII, that the centripetal force will be
reciprocally as the square of the distance of the body from the centre
of force S; and therefore we have rightly determined the line PQ, which
a body let go from a given place P with a given velocity, and in the
direction of the right line PR given by position, would describe with
such a force. Q.E.F.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence in every conic section, from the principal vertex D, the
latus rectum L, and the focus S given, the other focus H is given, by
taking DH to DS as the latus rectum to the difference between the latus
rectum and 4DS. For the proportion, SP + PH to PH as 2SP + 2KP to L,
becomes, in the case of this Corollary, DS + DH to DH as 4DS to L, and
by division DS to DH as 4DS - L to L.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Whence if the velocity of a body in the principal vertex
D is given, the orbit may be readily found; to wit, by taking its
latus rectum to twice the distance DS, in the duplicate ratio of this
given velocity to the velocity of a body revolving in a circle at the
distance DS (by Cor. 3, Prop. XVI.), and then taking DH to DS as the
latus rectum to the difference between the latus rectum and 4DS.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Hence also if a body move in any conic section, and is forced
out of its orbit by any impulse, you may discover the orbit in which it
will afterwards pursue its course. For by compounding the proper motion
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span> the body with that motion, which the impulse alone would generate,
you will have the motion with which the body will go off from a given
place of impulse in the direction of a right line given in position.</p>

<p>COR. 4. And if that body is continually disturbed by the action of
some foreign force, we may nearly know its course, by collecting the
changes which that force introduces in some points, and estimating the
continual changes it will undergo in the intermediate places, from the
analogy that appears in the progress of the series.</p>

<p>CASE 1. Let the given points be A, B, C, and Z the fourth point which

Taking PM to MA as MN is to AB, erect PR perpendicular to AB, and let
fall ZR perpendicular to PR; then from the nature of the hyperbola,
ZR will be to AZ as MN is to AB. And by the like argument, the locus
of the point Z will be another hyperbola, whose foci are A, C, and

perpendicular on AC may be drawn, to which (QS) if from any point Z of

as the difference between AZ and CZ is to AC. Wherefore the ratios of
ZR and ZS to AZ are given, and consequently the ratio of ZR to ZS one

TZ and TA are drawn, the figure TRZS will be given in specie, and the

that is, as SC to SB; and by permutation, IC to SC as HB to SB, or as

so (by supposition) PQ × PR to PS × PT. And because of the similar
trapezia <i>bk</i>A<i>f</i>, PQAS, as <i>bk</i> to <i>bf</i>, so PQ to
PS. Wherefore by dividing the terms of the preceding proportion by the
correspondent terms of this, we shall have <i>bn</i> to <i>bd</i> as PR
to PT. And therefore the equiangular trapezia D<i>nbd</i>, DRPT, are
similar, and consequently their diagonals D<i>b</i>, DP do coincide.
Wherefore <i>b</i> falls in the intersection of the right lines AP, DP,
and consequently coincides with the point P. And therefore the point P,
wherever it is taken, falls to be in the assigned conic section. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. Hence if three right lines PQ, PR, PS, are drawn from a common
point P, to as many other right lines given in position, AB, CD, AC,
each to each, in as many angles respectively given, and the rectangle
PQ × PR under any two of the lines drawn be to the square of the third
PS in a given ratio; the point P, from which the right lines are drawn,
will be placed in a conic section that touches the lines AB, CD in A
and C; and the contrary. For the position of the three right lines AB,
CD, AC remaining the same, let the line BD approach to and coincide
with the line AC; then let the line PT come likewise to coincide with
the line PS; and the rectangle PS × PT will become PS<sup>2</sup>, and the right
lines AB, CD, which before did cut the curve in the points A and B, C
and D, can no longer cut, but only touch, the curve in those coinciding
points.</p>

</figure>

<p>In this Lemma, the name of conic section is to be understood in a
large sense, comprehending as well the rectilinear section through the
vertex of the cone, as the circular one parallel to the base. For if
the point <i>p</i> happens to be in a right line, by which the points
A and D, or C and B are joined, the conic section will be changed into
two right lines, one of which is that right line upon which the point
<i>p</i> falls, and the other is a right line that joins the other two
of the four points. If the two opposite angles of the trapezium taken
together are equal to two right angles, and if the four lines PQ, PR,
PS, PT, are drawn to the sides thereof at right angles, or any other
equal angles, and the rectangle PQ × PR under two of the lines drawn PQ
and PR, is equal to the rectangle PS × PT under the other two PS and
PT, the conic section will become a circle. And the same thing will
happen if the four lines are drawn in any angles, and the rectangle PQ
× PR, under one pair of the lines drawn, is to the rectangle PS × PT
under the other pair as the rectangle under the sines of the angles
S, T, in which the two last lines PS, PT are drawn to the rectangle
under the sines of the angles Q, R, in which the first two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span> PQ, PR are
drawn. In all other cases the locus of the point P will be one of the
three figures which pass commonly by the name of the conic sections.
But in room of the trapezium ABCD, we may substitute a quadrilateral
figure whose two opposite sides cross one another like diagonals. And
one or two of the four points A, B, C, D may be supposed to be removed
to an infinite distance, by which means the sides of the figure which
converge to those points, will become parallel; and in this case the
conic section will pass through the other points, and will go the same
way as the parallels <i>in infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>Suppose the lines AB, CD, to which the two right lines PQ, PR,
containing one of the rectangles, are drawn to meet two other lines,
given by position, in the points A, B, C, D. From one of those, as A,
draw any right line AH, in which you would find the point P. Let this
cut the opposite lines BD, CD, in H and I; and, because all the angles
of the figure are given, the ratio of PQ to PA, and PA to PS, and
therefore of PQ to PS, will be also given. Subducting this ratio from
the given ratio of PQ × PR to PS × PT, the ratio of PR to PT will be
given; and adding the given ratios of PI to PR, and PT to PH, the ratio
of PI to PH, and therefore the point P will be given. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence also a tangent may be drawn to any point D of the locus
of all the points P. For the chord PD, where the points P and D meet,
that is, where AH is drawn through the point D, becomes a tangent. In
which case the ultimate ratio of the evanescent lines IP and PH will be
found as above. Therefore draw CF parallel to AD, meeting BD in F, and
cut it in E in the same ultimate ratio, then DE will be the tangent;
because CF and the evanescent IH are parallel, and similarly cut in E
and P.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Hence also the locus of all the points P may be determined.
Through any of the points A, B, C, D, as A, draw AE touching the
locus, and through any other point B parallel to the tangent, draw BF
meeting the locus in F; and find the point F by this Lemma. Bisect BF
in G, and, drawing the indefinite line AG, this will be the position
of the diameter to which BG and FG are ordinates. Let this AG meet
the locus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span> in H, and AH will be its diameter or latus transversum,
to which the latus rectum will be as BG<sup>2</sup> to AG × GH. If AG nowhere
meets the locus, the line AH being infinite, the locus will be a
parabola; and its latus rectum corresponding to the diameter AG will be
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{BG}^{2}}{\mathrm{AG}}" src="images/108.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 5.361ex; height: 5.174ex;" id="img_images_108.svg">.</span></p>

<p>But if it does meet it anywhere, the locus will be an hyperbola, when
the points A and H are placed on the same side the point G; and an
ellipsis, if the point G falls between the points A and H; unless,
perhaps, the angle AGB is a right angle, and at the same time BG<sup>2</sup>
equal to the rectangle AGH, in which case the locus will be a circle.</p>

<p>And so we have given in this Corollary a solution of that famous
Problem of the ancients concerning four lines, begun by Euclid, and
carried on by Apollonius; and this not an analytical calculus, but a

<p>CASE 1. Join BP, CP, and from the point D draw the two right lines DG,
DE, of which the first DG shall be parallel to AB, and meet PB, PQ, CA
in H, I, G; and the other DE shall be parallel to AC, and meet PC, PS,
AB, in F, K, E; and (by Lem. XVII) the rectangle DE × DF will be to the
rectangle DG × DH in a given ratio. But PQ is to DE (or IQ) as PB to
HB, and consequently as PT to DH; and by permutation PQ is to PT as DE
to DH. Likewise PR is to DF as RC to DC, and therefore as (IG or) PS
to DG; and by permutation PR is to PS as DF to DG; and, by compounding
those ratios, the rectangle PQ × PR will be to the rectangle PS × PT as
the rectangle DE × DF is to the rectangle DG × DH, and consequently in
a given ratio. But PQ and PS are given, and therefore the ratio of PR
to PT is given. Q.E.D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>CASE 2. But if PR and PT are supposed to be in a given ratio one to the
other, then by going back again, by a like reasoning, it will follow
that the rectangle DE × DF is to the rectangle DG × DH in a given
ratio; and so the point D (by Lem. XVIII) will lie in a conic section
passing through the points A, B, C, P, as its locus. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if we draw BC cutting PQ in <i>r</i> and in PT take
P<i>t</i> to P<i>r</i> in the same ratio which PT has to PR; then
B<i>t</i> will touch the conic section in the point B. For suppose the
point D to coalesce with the point B, so that the chord BD vanishing,
BT shall become a tangent, and CD and BT will coincide with CB and
B<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And, vice versa, if B<i>t</i> is a tangent, and the lines
BD, CD meet in any point D of a conic section, PR will be to PT as
P<i>r</i> to P<i>t</i>. And, on the contrary, if PR is to PT as
P<i>r</i> to P<i>t</i>, then BD and CD will meet in some point D of a
conic section.</p>

<p>COR. 3. One conic section cannot cut another conic section in more
than four points. For, if it is possible, let two conic sections pass
through the five points A, B, C, P, O; and let the right line BD cut
them in the points D, <i>d</i>, and the right line C<i>d</i> cut the

BPT equal to the given angle BNM, and the angle CPR<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span> equal to the given

equal, as also the angles MCD, NCP, take away the angles NBD and NCD
that are common, and there will remain the angles NBM and PBT, NCM and
PCR equal; and therefore the triangles NBM, PBT are similar, as also
the triangles NCM, PCR. Wherefore PT is to NM as PB to NB; and PR to
NM as PC to NC. But the points, B, C, N, P are immovable: wherefore PT
and PR have a given ratio to NM, and consequently a given ratio between

M falls successively on two immovable points <i>n</i>, N. Through these
points <i>n</i>, N, draw the right line <i>n</i>N: this line <i>n</i>N
will be the perpetual locus of that moveable point M. For, if possible,
let the point M be placed in any curve line. Therefore the point D
will be placed in a conic section passing through the five points B,
C, A, <i>p</i>, P, when the point M is perpetually placed in a curve
line. But from what was demonstrated before, the point D will be also
placed in a conic section passing through the same five points B, C, A,

<p>Suppose HI, KL to be the given tangents and B, C, D, the given points.
Through any two of those points, as B, D, draw the indefinite right
line BD meeting the tangents in the points H, K. Then likewise through
any other two of these points, as C, D, draw the indefinite right line
CD meeting the tangents in the points I, L. Cut the lines drawn in R
and S, so that HR may be to KR as the mean proportional between BH and
HD is to the mean proportional between BK and KD; and IS to LS as the
mean proportional between CI and ID is to the mean proportional between
CL and LD. But you may cut, at pleasure, either within or between the
points K and H, I and L, or without them; then draw RS cutting the
tangents in A and P, and A and P will be the points of contact. For if
A and P are supposed to be the points of contact, situated anywhere
else in the tangents, and through any of the points H, I, K, L, as I,
situated in either tangent HI, a right line IY is drawn parallel to
the other tangent KL, and meeting the curve in X and Y, and in that
right line there be taken IZ equal to a mean proportional between IX
and IY, the rectangle XIY or IZ<sup>2</sup>, will (by the properties of the conic
sections) be to LP<sup>2</sup> as the rectangle CID is to the rectangle CLD,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>that is (by the construction), as SI is to SL<sup>2</sup>, and therefore IZ
is to LP as SI to SL. Wherefore the points S, P, Z, are in one right
line. Moreover, since the tangents meet in G, the rectangle XIY or
IZ<sup>2</sup> will (by the properties of the conic sections) be to IA<sup>2</sup> as GP<sup>2</sup>
is to GA<sup>2</sup>, and consequently IZ will be to IA as GP to GA. Wherefore
the points P, Z, A, lie in one right line, and therefore the points S,
P, and A are in one right line. And the same argument will prove that
the points R, P, and A are in one right line. Wherefore the points of
contact A and P lie in the right line RS. But after these points are
found, the trajectory may be described, as in the first Case of the
preceding Problem. Q.E.F.</p>

<p>In this Proposition, and Case 2 of the foregoing, the constructions are
the same, whether the right line XY cut the trajectory in X and Y, or
not; neither do they depend upon that section. But the constructions
being demonstrated where that right line does cut the trajectory, the
constructions where it does not are also known; and therefore, for
brevity's sake, I omit any farther demonstration of them.</p>

<img alt="How to transform figures into other figures of the same kind." height="176" src="images/i_141.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_141.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Suppose that any figure HGI is to be transformed. Draw, at pleasure,
two parallel lines AO, BL, cutting any third line AB, given by
position, in A and B, and from any point G of the figure, draw out any
right line GD, parallel to OA, till it meet the right line AB. Then
from any given point O in the line OA, draw to the point D the right
line OD, meeting BL in <i>d</i>; and from the point of concourse raise
the right line <i>dg</i> containing any given angle with the right line
BL, and having such ratio to O<i>d</i> as DG has to OD; and <i>g</i>
will be the point in the new figure <i>hgi</i>, corresponding to the
point G. And in like manner the several points of the first figure will
give as many correspondent points of the new figure. If we therefore
conceive the point G to be carried along by a continual motion through
all the points of the first figure, the point <i>g</i> will be likewise
carried along by a continual motion through all the points of the new
figure, and describe the same. For distinction's sake, let us call DG
the first ordinate, <i>dg</i> the new ordinate, AD the first abscissa,
<i>ad</i> the new abscissa; O the pole, OD the abscinding radius, OA
the first ordinate radius, and O<i>a</i> (by which the parallelogram
OAB<i>a</i> is completed) the new ordinate radius.</p>

<p>I say, then, that if the point G is placed in a right line given by
position, the point <i>g</i> will be also placed in a right line
given by position. If the point G is placed in a conic section, the
point <i>g</i> will be likewise placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span> in a conic section. And here
I understand the circle as one of the conic sections. But farther, if
the point G is placed in a line of the third analytical order, the
point <i>g</i> will also be placed in a line of the third order, and so
on in curve lines of higher orders. The two lines in which the points
G, <i>g</i>, are placed, will be always of the same analytical order.
For as <i>ad</i> is to OA, so are O<i>d</i> to OD, <i>dg</i> to DG,
and AB to AD; and therefore AD is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{OA} \times\, \mathrm{AB}}{ad}" src="images/109.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 10.895ex; height: 4.724ex;" id="img_images_109.svg">,</span>
and DG equal to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{OA} \times\, dg}{ad}" src="images/110.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 9.852ex; height: 4.724ex;" id="img_images_110.svg">.</span>
Now if the point G is placed in a right line, and therefore, in any
equation by which the relation between the abscissa AD and the ordinate
GD is expressed, those indetermined lines AD and DG rise no higher
than to one dimension, by writing this equation
<img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{OA} \times\, \mathrm{AB}}{ad}" src="images/109.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 10.895ex; height: 4.724ex;" id="img_images_109.svg_1"> in place of AD, and
<img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{OA} \times\, dg}{ad}" src="images/110.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.575ex; width: 9.852ex; height: 4.724ex;" id="img_images_110.svg_1"> in place of DG, a new equation
will be produced, in which the new abscissa <i>ad</i> and new ordinate
<i>dg</i> rise only to one dimension; and which therefore must denote
a right line. But if AD and DG (or either of them) had risen to two
dimensions in the first equation, <i>ad</i> and <i>dg</i> would
likewise have risen to two dimensions in the second equation. And so
on in three or more dimensions. The indetermined lines, <i>ad</i>,
<i>dg</i> in the second equation, and AD, DG, in the first, will always
rise to the same number of dimensions; and therefore the lines in which
the points G, <i>g</i>, are placed are of the same analytical order.</p>

<p>I say farther, that if any right line touches the curve line in the
first figure, the same right line transferred the same way with the
curve into the new figure will touch that curve line in the new figure,
and <i>vice versa</i>. For if any two points of the curve in the
first figure are supposed to approach one the other till they come to
coincide, the same points transferred will approach one the other till
they come to coincide in the new figure; and therefore the right lines
with which those points are joined will become together tangents of
the curves in both figures. I might have given demonstrations of these
assertions in a more geometrical form; but I study to be brief.</p>

<p>Wherefore if one rectilinear figure is to be transformed into another,
we need only transfer the intersections of the right lines of which the
first figure consists, and through the transferred intersections to
draw right lines in the new figure. But if a curvilinear figure is to
be transformed, we must transfer the points, the tangents, and other
right lines, by means of which the curve line is defined. This Lemma is
of use in the solution of the more difficult Problems; for thereby we
may transform the proposed figures, if they are intricate, into others
that are more simple. Thus any right lines converging to a point are
transformed into parallels, by taking for the first ordinate radius any
right line that passes through the point of concourse of the converging
lines, and that because their point of concourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span> is by this means made
to go off <i>in infinitum</i>; and parallel lines are such as tend to
a point infinitely remote. And after the problem is solved in the new
figure, if by the inverse operations we transform the new into the
first figure, we shall have the solution required.</p>

<p>This Lemma is also of use in the solution of solid problems. For as
often as two conic sections occur, by the intersection of which a
problem may be solved, any one of them may be transformed, if it is
an hyperbola or a parabola, into an ellipsis, and then this ellipsis
may be easily changed into a circle. So also a right line and a conic
section, in the construction of plane problems, may be transformed into
a right line and a circle.</p>

by the preceding Lemma into a new figure. In this figure those two
tangents will become parallel to each other, and the third tangent
will be parallel to the right line that passes through the two given
points. Suppose <i>hi</i>, <i>kl</i> to be those two parallel tangents,
<i>ik</i> the third tangent, and <i>hl</i> a right line parallel

the conic section ought to pass in this new figure; and completing the

first whereof is the right line <i>ik</i>, and the other two are
the square roots of the rectangles <i>ahb</i> and <i>alb</i>; and

in the same ratio; and therefore <i>hc</i> to the square root of

BC draw KL at such distance that the centre O may be placed in the

Through the points C and K, F and L, where the tangents not parallel,

And by the same method the other points of contact may be found, and

<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>Under the preceding Propositions are comprehended those Problems
wherein either the centres or asymptotes of the trajectories are given.
For when points and tangents and the centre are given, as many other
points and as many other tangents are given at an equal distance on
the other side of the centre. And an asymptote is to be considered as
a tangent, and its infinitely remote extremity (if we may say so) is a
point of contact. Conceive the point of contact of any tangent removed
<i>in infinitum</i>, and the tangent will degenerate into an asymptote,
and the constructions of the preceding Problems will be changed into
the constructions of those Problems wherein the asymptote is given.</p>

</figure>

<p>After the trajectory is described, we may find its axes and foci in
this manner. In the construction and figure of Lem. XXI, let those legs
BP, CP, of the moveable angles PBN, PCN, by the concourse of which
the trajectory was described, be made parallel one to the other; and
retaining that position, let them revolve about their poles P, C, in
that figure. In the mean while let the other legs CN, BN, of those
angles, by their concourse K or <i>k</i>, describe the circle BKGC. Let
O be the centre of this circle; and from this centre upon the ruler
MN, wherein those legs CN, BN did concur while the trajectory was
described, let fall the perpendicular OH meeting the circle in K and L.
And when those other legs CK, BK meet in the point K that is nearest
to the ruler, the first legs CP, BP will be parallel to the greater
axis, and perpendicular on the lesser; and the contrary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> will happen if
those legs meet in the remotest point L. Whence if the centre of the
trajectory is given, the axes will be given; and those being given, the
foci will be readily found.</p>

</figure>

<p>But the squares of the axes are one to the other as KH to LH, and
thence it is easy to describe a trajectory given in kind through four
given points. For if two of the given points are made the poles C,
B, the third will give the moveable angles PCK, PBK; but those being
given, the circle BGKC may be described. Then, because the trajectory
is given in kind, the ratio of OH to OK, and therefore OH itself, will
be given. About the centre O, with the interval OH, describe another
circle, and the right line that touches this circle, and passes through
the concourse of the legs CK, BK, when the first legs CP, BP meet in
the fourth given point, will be the ruler MN, by means of which the
trajectory may be described. Whence also on the other hand a trapezium
given in kind (excepting a few cases that are impossible) may be
inscribed in a given conic section.</p>

<p>There are also other Lemmas, by the help of which trajectories given
in kind may be described through given points, and touching given
lines. Of such a sort is this, that if a right line is drawn through

<p>For drawing F<i>c</i> meeting <i>a</i>D in <i>n</i>, and joining
<i>a</i>G, <i>b</i>G, QG, QD, PD, by construction the angle E<i>a</i>D
is equal to the angle CAB, and the angle <i>ac</i>F equal to the angle
ACB; and therefore the triangle <i>anc</i> equiangular to the triangle
ABC. Wherefore the angle <i>anc</i> or F<i>n</i>D is equal to the
angle ABC, and consequently to the angle F<i>b</i>D; and therefore
the point <i>n</i> falls on the point <i>b</i>. Moreover the angle
GPQ, which is half the angle GPD at the centre, is equal to the angle
G<i>a</i>D at the circumference; and the angle GQP, which is half
the angle GQD at the centre, is equal to the complement to two right
angles of the angle G<i>b</i>D at the circumference, and therefore
equal to the angle G<i>ba</i>. Upon which account the triangles GPQ,
G<i>ab</i>, are similar, and G<i>a</i> is to <i>ab</i> as GP to PQ;
that is (by construction), as G<i>a</i> to AB. Wherefore <i>ab</i> and
AB are equal; and consequently the triangles <i>abc</i>, ABC, which

<p class="nindc space-above2">LEMMA XXVIII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>There is no oval figure whose area, cut off by right lines at
pleasure, can be universally found by means of equations of any number
of finite terms and dimensions.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Suppose that within the oval any point is given, about which as a
pole a right line is perpetually revolving with an uniform motion,
while in that right line a moveable point going out from the pole
moves always forward with a velocity proportional to the square of
that right line within the oval. By this motion that point will
describe a spiral with infinite circumgyrations. Now if a portion of
the area of the oval cut off by that right line could be found by a
finite equation, the distance of the point from the pole, which is
proportional to this area, might be found by the same equation, and
therefore all the points of the spiral might be found by a finite
equation also; and therefore the intersection of a right line given
in position with the spiral might also be found by a finite equation.
But every right line infinitely produced cuts a spiral in an infinite
number of points; and the equation by which any one intersection of
two lines is found at the same time exhibits all their intersections
by as many roots, and therefore rises to as many dimensions as there
are intersections. Because two circles mutually cut one another in
two points, one of those intersections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span> is not to be found but by an
equation of two dimensions, by which the other intersection may be also
found. Because there may be four intersections of two conic sections,
any one of them is not to be found universally, but by an equation of
four dimensions, by which they may be all found together. For if those
intersections are severally sought, because the law and condition
of all is the same, the calculus will be the same in every case,
and therefore the conclusion always the same, which must therefore
comprehend all those intersections at once within itself, and exhibit
them all indifferently. Hence it is that the intersections of the conic
sections with the curves of the third order, because they may amount
to six, come out together by equations of six dimensions; and the
intersections of two curves of the third order, because they may amount
to nine, come out together by equations of nine dimensions. If this did
not necessarily happen, we might reduce all solid to plane Problems,
and those higher than solid to solid Problems. But here I speak of
curves irreducible in power. For if the equation by which the curve
is defined may be reduced to a lower power, the curve will not be one
single curve, but composed of two, or more, whose intersections may be
severally found by different calculuses. After the same manner the two
intersections of right lines with the conic sections come out always
by equations of two dimensions; the three intersections of right lines
with the irreducible curves of the third order by equations of three
dimensions; the four intersections of right lines with the irreducible
curves of the fourth order, by equations of four dimensions; and so
on <i>in infinitum</i>. Wherefore the innumerable intersections of a
right line with a spiral, since this is but one simple curve and not
reducible to more curves, require equations infinite in number of
dimensions and roots, by which they may be all exhibited together.
For the law and calculus of all is the same. For if a perpendicular
is let fall from the pole upon that intersecting right line, and that
perpendicular together with the intersecting line revolves about the
pole, the intersections of the spiral will mutually pass the one into
the other; and that which was first or nearest, after one revolution,
will be the second; after two, the third; and so on: nor will the
equation in the mean time be changed but as the magnitudes of those
quantities are changed, by which the position of the intersecting line
is determined. Wherefore since those quantities after every revolution
return to their first magnitudes, the equation will return to its first
form; and consequently one and the same equation will exhibit all the
intersections, and will therefore have an infinite number of roots,
by which they may be all exhibited. And therefore the intersection of
a right line with a spiral cannot be universally found by any finite
equation; and of consequence there is no oval figure whose area cut off
by right lines at pleasure, can be universally exhibited by any such
equation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>By the same argument, if the interval of the pole and point by which
the spiral is described is taken proportional to that part of the
perimeter of the oval which is cut off, it may be proved that the
length of the perimeter cannot be universally exhibited by any finite
equation. But here I speak of ovals that are not touched by conjugate
figures running out <i>in infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>COR. Hence the area of an ellipsis, described by a radius drawn from
the focus to the moving body, is not to be found from the time given
by a finite equation; and therefore cannot be determined by the
description of curves geometrically rational. Those curves I call
geometrically rational, all the points whereof may be determined by
lengths that are definable by equations; that is, by the complicated
ratios of lengths. Other curves (such as spirals, quadratrixes, and
cycloids) I call geometrically irrational. For the lengths which are or
are not as number to number (according to the tenth Book of Elements)
are arithmetically rational or irrational. And therefore I cut off an
area of an ellipsis proportional to the time in which it is described
by a curve geometrically irrational, in the following manner.</p>

<p>Suppose A to be the principal vertex, S the focus, and O the centre
of the ellipsis APB; and let P be the place of the body to be
found. Produce OA to G so as OG may be to OA as OA to OS. Erect the
perpendicular GH; and about the centre O, with the interval OG,
describe the circle GEF; and on the ruler GH, as a base, suppose the
wheel GEF to move forwards, revolving about its axis, and in the mean
time by its point A describing the cycloid ALI. Which done, take GK to
the perimeter GEFG of the wheel, in the ratio of the time in which the

</figure>

<p>But since the description of this curve is difficult, a solution by
approximation will be preferable. First, then, let there be found a
certain angle B which may be to an angle of 57,29578 degrees, which an
arc equal to the radius subtends, as SH, the distance of the foci, to
AB, the diameter of the ellipsis. Secondly, a certain length L, which
may be to the radius in the same ratio inversely. And these being
found, the Problem may be solved by the following analysis. By any
construction (or even by conjecture), suppose we know P the place of
the body near its true place <i>p</i>. Then letting fall on the axis
of the ellipsis the ordinate PR from the proportion of the diameters
of the ellipsis, the ordinate RQ of the circumscribed circle AQB will
be given; which ordinate is the sine of the angle AOQ, supposing AO to
be the radius, and also cuts the ellipsis in P. It will be sufficient
if that angle is found by a rude calculus in numbers near the truth.
Suppose we also know the angle proportional to the time, that is, which
is to four right angles as the time in which the body described the
arc A<i>p</i>, to the time of one revolution in the ellipsis. Let this
angle be N. Then take an angle D, which may be to the angle B as the
sine of the angle AOQ to the radius; and an angle E which may be to
the angle N - AOQ + D as the length L to the same length L diminished
by the cosine of the angle AOQ, when that angle is less than a right
angle, or increased thereby when greater. In the next place, take an
angle F that may be to the angle B as the sine of the angle AOQ + E to
the radius, and an angle G, that may be to the angle N - AOQ - E + F
as the length L to the same length L diminished by the cosine of the
angle AOQ + E, when that angle is less than a right angle, or increased
thereby when greater. For the third time take an angle H, that may be
to the angle B as the sine of the angle AOQ + E + G to the radius; and
an angle I to the angle N - AOQ - E - G + H, as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span> length L is to
the same length L diminished by the cosine of the angle AOQ + E + G,
when that angle is less than a right angle, or increased thereby when
greater. And so we may proceed <i>in infinitum</i>. Lastly, take the
angle AO<i>q</i> equal to the angle AOQ + E + G + I +, &amp;c. and from
its <img alt="" data-tex="\cos{\mathrm{O}r}" src="images/125.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 6.185ex; height: 1.645ex;" id="img_images_125.svg"> and the ordinate <i>pr</i>, which is to its
<img alt="" data-tex="\sin{qr}" src="images/126.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 5.216ex; height: 1.952ex;" id="img_images_126.svg"> as the lesser axis of the ellipsis to the greater, we
shall have <i>p</i> the correct place of the body. When the angle N
- AOQ + D happens to be negative, the sign + of the angle E must be
every where changed into -, and the sign - into +. And the same thing
is to be understood of the signs of the angles G and I, when the angles
N - AOQ - E + F, and N - AOQ - E - G + H come out negative. But the
infinite series AOQ + E + G + I +, &amp;c. converges so very fast, that
it will be scarcely ever needful to proceed beyond the second term E.
And the calculus is founded upon this Theorem, that the area APS is as
the difference between the arc AQ and the right line let fall from the
focus S perpendicularly upon the radius OQ.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_158a">

</figure>

<p>And by a calculus not unlike, the Problem is solved in the hyperbola.
Let its centre be O, its vertex A, its focus S, and asymptote OK; and
suppose the quantity of the area to be cut off is known, as being
proportional to the time. Let that be A, and by conjecture suppose
we know the position of a right line SP, that cuts off an area APS
near the truth. Join OP, and from A and P to the asymptote draw AI,
PK parallel to the other asymptote; and by the table of logarithms
the area AIKP will be given, and equal thereto the area OPA, which
subducted from the triangle OPS, will leave the area cut off APS. And
by applying 2APS - 2A, or 2A - 2APS, the double difference of the area
A that was to be cut off, and the area APS that is cut off, to the line
SN that is let fall from the focus S, perpendicular upon the tangent
TP, we shall have the length of the chord PQ. Which chord PQ is to be
inscribed between A and P, if the area APS that is cut off be greater
than the area A that was to be cut off, but towards the contrary side
of the point P, if otherwise: and the point Q will be the place of the
body more accurately. And by repeating the computation the place may be
found perpetually to greater and greater accuracy.</p>

<p>And by such computations we have a general analytical resolution of
the Problem. But the particular calculus that follows is better fitted
for astronomical purposes. Supposing AO, OB, OD, to be the semi-axis
of the ellipsis, and L its latus rectum, and D the difference betwixt
the lesser semi-axis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span> OD, and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm L" src="images/127.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.209ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_127.svg"> the half of the
latus rectum: let an angle Y be found, whose sine may be to the radius
as the rectangle under that difference D, and AO + OD the half sum
of the axes to the square of the greater axis AB. Find also an angle
Z, whose sine may be to the radius as the double rectangle under the
distance of the foci SH and that difference D to triple the square of
half the greater semi-axis AO. Those angles being once found, the place
of the body may be thus determined. Take the angle T proportional to
the time in which the arc BP was described, or equal to what is called
the mean motion; and an angle V the first equation of the mean motion
to the angle Y, the greatest first equation, as the sine of double
the angle T is to the radius; and an angle X, the second equation, to
the angle Z, the second greatest equation, as the cube of the sine of
the angle T is to the cube of the radius. Then take the angle BHP the
mean motion equated equal to T + X + V, the sum of the angles T, V, X,
if the angle T is less than a right angle; or equal to T + X - V, the
difference of the same, if that angle T is greater than one and less
than two right angles; and if HP meets the ellipsis in P, draw SP, and
it will cut off the area BSP nearly proportional to the time.</p>

<p>This practice seems to be expeditious enough, because the angles V and
X, taken in second minutes, if you please, being very small, it will
be sufficient to find two or three of their first figures. But it is
likewise sufficiently accurate to answer to the theory of the planet's
motions. For even in the orbit of Mars, where the greatest equation of
the centre amounts to ten degrees, the error will scarcely exceed one
second. But when the angle of the mean motion equated BHP is found, the
angle of the true motion BSP, and the distance SP, are readily had by
the known methods.</p>

<p>And so far concerning the motion of bodies in curve lines. But it may
also come to pass that a moving body shall ascend or descend in a right
line; and I shall now go on to explain what belongs to such kind of
motions.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Let P be the place from whence a body ought to fall, so as
that, when urged by any known uniform centripetal force (such as
gravity is vulgarly supposed to be), it may acquire in the place D
a velocity equal to the velocity which another body, falling by any
force whatever, hath acquired in that place D. In the perpendicular
DF let there be taken DR, which may be to DF as that uniform force to
the other force in the place D. Complete the rectangle PDRQ, and cut
off the area ABFD equal to that rectangle. Then A will be the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>

to the increment of the velocity of the body falling by the unequable
force; and in like manner the area PQRD to the area DRSE as half the
whole velocity to the increment of the velocity of the body falling
by the uniform force; and since those increments (by reason of the
equality of the nascent times) are as the generating forces, that is,
as the ordinates DF, DR, and consequently as the nascent areas DFGE,
DRSE; therefore, <i>ex æquo</i>, the whole areas ABFD, PQRD will be
to one another as the halves of the whole velocities; and therefore,
because the velocities are equal, they become equal also.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Whence if any body be projected either upwards or downwards
with a given velocity from any place D, and there be given the law of
centripetal force acting on it, its velocity will be found in any other

velocity to the velocity in the place D as a right line whose square
is equal to the rectangle PQRD, either increased by the curvilinear

the same area DF<i>ge</i>, if it be higher, is to the right line whose

<p>Let a body descend from A through D and E, to the centre C; and let
another body move from V in the curve line VIK<i>k</i>. From the centre
C, with any distances, describe the concentric circles DI, EK, meeting
the right line AC in D and E, and the curve VIK in I and K. Draw IC
meeting KE in N, and on IK let fall the perpendicular NT; and let the
interval DE or IN between the circumferences of the circles be very
small; and imagine the bodies in D and I to have equal velocities.
Then because the distances CD and CI are equal, the centripetal
forces in D and I will be also equal. Let those forces be expressed
by the equal lineolæ DE and IN; and let the force IN (by Cor. 2 of
the Laws of Motion) be resolved into two others, NT and IT. Then the
force NT acting in the direction of the line NT perpendicular to the
path ITK of the body will not at all affect or change the velocity
of the body in that path, but only draw it aside from a rectilinear
course, and make it deflect perpetually from the tangent of the orbit,
and proceed in the curvilinear path ITK<i>k</i>. That whole force,
therefore, will be spent in producing this effect; but the other force
IT, acting in the direction of the course of the body, will be all
employed in accelerating it, and in the least given time will produce
an acceleration proportional to itself. Therefore the accelerations
of the bodies in D and I, produced in equal times, are as the lines
DE, IT (if we take the first ratios of the nascent lines DE, IN, IK,
IT, NT); and in unequal times as those lines and the times conjunctly.
But the times in which DE and IK are described, are, by reason of the
equal velocities (in D and I) as the spaces described DE and IK, and
therefore the accelerations in the course of the bodies through the
lines DE and IK are as DE and IT, and DE and IK conjunctly; that is, as
the square of DE to the rectangle IT into IK. But the rectangle IT × IK
is equal to the square of IN, that is, equal to the square of DE; and
therefore the accelerations generated in the passage of the bodies from
D and I to E and K are equal. Therefore the velocities of the bodies in
E and K are also equal: and by the same reasoning they will always be
found equal in any subsequent equal distances. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>By the same reasoning, bodies of equal velocities and equal distances
from the centre will be equally retarded in their ascent to equal
distances. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore if a body either oscillates by hanging to a string,
or by any polished and perfectly smooth impediment is forced to move in
a curve line; and another body ascends or descends in a right line, and
their velocities be equal at any one equal altitude, their velocities
will be also equal at all other equal altitudes. For by the string of
the pendulous body, or by the impediment of a vessel perfectly smooth,
the same thing will be effected as by the transverse force NT. The body
is neither accelerated nor retarded by it, but only is obliged to leave
its rectilinear course.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Suppose the quantity P to be the greatest distance from the
centre to which a body can ascend, whether it be oscillating, or
revolving in a trajectory, and so the same projected upwards from any
point of a trajectory with the velocity it has in that point. Let the
quantity A be the distance of the body from the centre in any other
point of the orbit; and let the centripetal force be always as the
power <img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{A}^{n - 1}" src="images/147.svg" style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.889ex; height: 1.887ex;" id="img_images_147.svg"> of the quantity A, the index of which
power <i>n</i> - 1 is any number <i>n</i> diminished by unity. Then

respectively, and let the curve lines <i>ab</i>, <i>ac</i>, the foci
of the points <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, be described: and from the
point V let the perpendicular V<i>a</i> be erected to the line AC,
cutting off the curvilinear areas VD<i>ba</i>, VD<i>ca</i>, and let
the ordinates E<i>z</i>, E<i>x</i>, be erected also. Then because the
rectangle D<i>b</i> × IN or D<i>bz</i>E is equal to half the rectangle
A × KN, or to the triangle ICK; and the rectangle D<i>c</i> × IN or
D<i>cx</i>E is equal to half the rectangle YX × XC, or to the triangle
XCY; that is, because the nascent particles D<i>bz</i>E, ICK of the
areas VD<i>ba</i>, VIC are always equal; and the nascent particles
D<i>cx</i>E, XCY of the areas VD<i>ca</i>, VCX are always equal:
therefore the generated area VD<i>ba</i> will be equal to the generated
area VIC, and therefore proportional to the time; and the generated
area VD<i>ca</i> is equal to the generated sector VCX. If, therefore,
any time be given during which the body has been moving from V, there
will be also given the area proportional to it VD<i>ba</i>; and
thence will be given the altitude of the body CD or CI; and the area
VD<i>ca</i>, and the sector VCX equal thereto, together with its angle
VCI. But the angle VCI, and the altitude CI being given, there is also
given the place I, in which the body will be found at the end of that
time. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence the greatest and least altitudes of the bodies, that is, the
apsides of the trajectories, may be found very readily. For the apsides
are those points in which a right line IC drawn through the centre falls
perpendicularly upon the trajectory VIK; which comes to pass when the
right lines IK and NK become equal; that is, when the area ABFD is
equal to ZZ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>COR. 2. So also the angle KIN, in which the trajectory at any place
cuts the line IC, may be readily found by the given altitude IC of the
body: to wit, by making the sine of that angle to radius as KN to IK;
that is, as Z to the square root of the area ABFD.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_171a">
<img alt="The angle KIN, in which the trajectory at any place cuts the line IC, may be readily found by the given altitude IC of the body." height="121" src="images/i_171a.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_171a.jpg">
</figure>

<p>COR. 3. If to the centre C, and the principal vertex V, there be
described a conic section VRS; and from any point thereof, as R, there
be drawn the tangent RT meeting the axis CV indefinitely produced in
the point T; and then joining CR there be drawn the right line CP,
equal to the abscissa CT, making an angle VCP proportional to the
sector VCR; and if a centripetal force, reciprocally proportional to
the cubes of the distances of the places from the centre, tends to
the centre C; and from the place V there sets out a body with a just
velocity in the direction of a line perpendicular to the right line
CV; that body will proceed in a trajectory VPQ, which the point P will
always touch; and therefore if the conic section VRS be an hyperbola,
the body will descend to the centre; but if it be an ellipsis, it will
ascend perpetually, and go farther and farther off <i>in infinitum</i>.
And, on the contrary, if a body endued with any velocity goes off from
the place V, and according as it begins either to descend obliquely to
the centre, or ascends obliquely from it, the figure VRS be either an
hyperbola or an ellipsis, the trajectory may be found by increasing
or diminishing the angle VCP in a given ratio. And the centripetal
force becoming centrifugal, the body will ascend obliquely in the
trajectory VPQ, which is found by taking the angle VCP proportional to
the elliptic sector VRC, and the length CP equal to the length CT, as
before. All these things follow from the foregoing Proposition, by the
quadrature of a certain curve, the invention of which, as being easy
enough, for brevity's sake I omit.</p>

<p>In the orbit VPK, given by position, let the body P revolve, proceeding
from V towards K. From the centre C let there be continually drawn
C<i>p</i>, equal to CP, making the angle VC<i>p</i> proportional to
the angle VCP; and the area which the line C<i>p</i> describes will
be to the area VCP, which the line CP describes at the same time, as
the velocity of the describing line C<i>p</i> to the velocity of the
describing line CP; that is, as the angle VC<i>p</i> to the angle VCP,
therefore in a given ratio, and therefore proportional to the time.

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XLIV. THEOREM XIV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The difference of the forces, by which two bodies may be made
to move equally, one in a quiescent, the other in the same orbit
revolving, is in a triplicate ratio of their common altitudes
inversely.</i></p>
</div>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_173">
<img alt="The force difference moving two bodies—one at rest, one revolving in the same orbit—is inversely proportional to the cube of their altitudes." height="226" src="images/i_173.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_173.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Let the parts of the quiescent orbit VP, PK be similar and equal to
the parts of the revolving orbit <i>up</i>, <i>pk</i>; and let the
distance of the points P and K be supposed of the utmost smallness.
Let fall a perpendicular <i>kr</i> from the point <i>k</i> to the
right line <i>p</i>C, and produce it to <i>m</i>, so that <i>mr</i>
may be to <i>kr</i> as the angle VC<i>p</i> to the angle VCP. Because
the altitudes of the bodies PC and <i>p</i>C, KC and <i>k</i>C, are
always equal, it is manifest that the increments or decrements of the
lines PC and <i>p</i>C are always equal; and therefore if each of the
several motions of the bodies in the places P and <i>p</i> be resolved
into two (by Cor. 2 of the Laws of Motion), one of which is directed
towards the centre, or according to the lines PC, <i>p</i>C, and the
other, transverse to the former, hath a direction perpendicular to
the lines PC and <i>p</i>C; the motions towards the centre will be
equal, and the transverse motion of the body <i>p</i> will be to the
transverse motion of the body P as the angular motion of the line
<i>p</i>C to the angular motion of the line PC; that is, as the angle
VC<i>p</i> to the angle VCP. Therefore, at the same time that the
body P, by both its motions, comes to the point K, the body <i>p</i>,
having an equal motion towards the centre, will be equally moved from
<i>p</i> towards C; and therefore that time being expired, it will be
found somewhere in the line <i>mkr</i>, which, passing through the
point <i>k</i>, is perpendicular to the line <i>p</i>C; and by its
transverse motion will acquire a distance from the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span> <i>p</i>C,
that will be to the distance which the other body P acquires from the
line PC as the transverse motion of the body <i>p</i> to the transverse
motion of the other body P. Therefore since <i>kr</i> is equal to the
distance which the body P acquires from the line PC, and <i>mr</i> is
to <i>kr</i> as the angle VC<i>p</i> to the angle VCP, that is, as the
transverse motion of the body <i>p</i> to the transverse motion of the
body P, it is manifest that the body <i>p</i>, at the expiration of
that time, will be found in the place <i>m</i>. These things will be
so, if the bodies <i>p</i> and P are equally moved in the directions
of the lines <i>p</i>C and PC, and are therefore urged with equal
forces in those directions, But if we take an angle <i>p</i>C<i>n</i>
that is to the angle <i>p</i>C<i>k</i> as the angle VC<i>p</i> to the
angle VCP, and <i>n</i>C be equal to <i>k</i>C, in that case the body
<i>p</i> at the expiration of the time will really be in <i>n</i>;
and is therefore urged with a greater force than the body P, if the
angle <i>n</i>C<i>p</i> is greater than the angle <i>k</i>C<i>p</i>,
that is, if the orbit <i>upk</i>, move either <i>in consequentia</i>
or <i>in antecedentia</i>, with a celerity greater than the double
of that with which the line CP moves <i>in consequentia</i>; and
with a less force if the orbit moves slower <i>in antecedentia</i>.
And the difference of the forces will be as the interval <i>mn</i>
of the places through which the body would be carried by the action
of that difference in that given space of time. About the centre C
with the interval C<i>n</i> or C<i>k</i> suppose a circle described
cutting the lines <i>mr</i>, <i>mn</i> produced in <i>s</i> and
<i>t</i>, and the rectangle <i>mn</i> × <i>mt</i> will be equal to
the rectangle <i>mk</i> × <i>ms</i>, and therefore <i>mn</i> will
be equal to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{mk \times\, ms}{mt}" src="images/157.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 10.352ex; height: 4.676ex;" id="img_images_157.svg">.</span> But since the triangles
<i>p</i>C<i>k</i>, <i>p</i>C<i>n</i>, in a given time, are of a given
magnitude, <i>kr</i> and <i>mr</i>, and their difference <i>mk</i>, and
their sum <i>ms</i>, are reciprocally as the altitude <i>p</i>C, and
therefore the rectangle <i>mk</i> × <i>ms</i> is reciprocally as the
square of the altitude <i>p</i>C. But, moreover, <i>mt</i> is directly

hat is, the nascent lineola <i>mn</i>, and the difference
of the forces proportional thereto, are reciprocally as the cube of the
altitude <i>p</i>C. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence the difference of the forces in the places P and
<i>p</i>, or K and <i>k</i>, is to the force with which a body may
revolve with a circular motion from R to K, in the same time that
the body P in an immovable orb describes the arc PK, as the nascent

as <i>mk</i> × <i>ms</i> to the square of <i>rk</i>; that is, if we
take given quantities F and G in the same ratio to one another as
the angle VCP bears to the angle VC<i>p</i>, as GG - FF to FF. And,
therefore, if from the centre C, with any distance CP or C<i>p</i>,
there be described a circular sector equal to the whole area VPC,
which the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span> revolving in an immovable orbit has by a radius drawn
to the centre described in any certain time, the difference of the
forces, with which the body P revolves in an immovable orbit, and the
body <i>p</i> in a movable orbit, will be to the centripetal force,
with which another body by a radius drawn to the centre can uniformly
describe that sector in the same time as the area VPC is described, as
GG - FF to FF. For that sector and the area <i>p</i>C<i>k</i> are to
one another as the times in which they are described.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If the orbit VPK be an ellipsis, having its focus C, and its

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching very near to
circles.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This problem is solved arithmetically by reducing the orbit, which
a body revolving in a movable ellipsis (as in Cor. 2 and 3 of the
above Prop.) describes in an immovable plane, to the figure of the
orbit whose apsides are required; and then seeking the apsides of the
orbit which that body describes in an immovable plane. But orbits
acquire the same figure, if the centripetal forces with which they
are described, compared between themselves, are made proportional at
equal altitudes. Let the point V be the highest apsis, and write T for
the greatest altitude CV, A for any other altitude CP or C<i>p</i>,
and X for the difference of the altitudes CV - CP; and the force with
which a body moves in an ellipsis revolving about its focus C (as in
Cor. 2), and which in Cor. 2 was as
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{FF}}{\mathrm{AA}} + \dfrac{\mathrm{RGG} - \mathrm{RFF}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/168.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 20.753ex; height: 4.752ex;" id="img_images_168.svg_1">,</span>
that is as, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{FFA} + \mathrm{RGG} - \mathrm{RFF}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/173.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 21.016ex; height: 4.777ex;" id="img_images_173.svg">,</span>
by substituting T - X for A, will become as
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{RGG} - \mathrm{RFF} + \mathrm{TFF} - \mathrm{FFX}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/174.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 28.37ex; height: 4.752ex;" id="img_images_174.svg">.</span>
In like manner any other centripetal force is to be reduced to a
fraction whose denominator is A<sup>3</sup>, and the numerators are to be made
analogous by collating together the homologous terms. This will be made
plainer by Examples.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 1. Let us suppose the centripetal force to be uniform, and
therefore as <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{A}^{3}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/175.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 3.68ex; height: 5.042ex;" id="img_images_175.svg"> or, writing T -
X for A in the numerator, as
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{T}^{3} - 3\mathrm{TTX} + 3\mathrm{TXX} - \mathrm{X}^{3}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/176.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 26.852ex; height: 5.042ex;" id="img_images_176.svg">.</span>
Then collating together the correspondent terms of the numerators,
that is, those that consist of given quantities, with those of given
quantities, and those of quantities not given with those of quantities
not given, it will become RGG - RFF + TFF to T<sup>3</sup> as - FFX to 3TTX
+ 3TXX - X<sup>3</sup>, or as -FF to -3TT + 3TX - XX. Now since the orbit is
supposed extremely near to a circle, let it coincide with a circle;
and because in that case R and T become equal, and X is infinitely
diminished, the last ratios will be, as RGG to T<sup>2</sup>, so -FF to -3TT, or
as GG to TT, so FF to 3TT; and again, as GG to FF, so TT to 3TT, that
is, as 1 to 3; and therefore G is to F, that is, the angle VC<i>p</i>
to the angle VCP, as 1 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{3}" src="images/177.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.251ex; width: 3.061ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_177.svg">.</span> Therefore since the body, in an
immovable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span> ellipsis, in descending from the upper to the lower apsis,
describes an angle, if I may so speak, of 180 deg., the other body in a
movable ellipsis, and therefore in the immovable orbit we are treating
of, will in its descent from the upper to the lower apsis, describe an
angle VC<i>p</i> of <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{180}{\sqrt{3}}" src="images/178.svg" style="vertical-align: -2.308ex; width: 4.389ex; height: 5.344ex;" id="img_images_178.svg"> deg. And this comes to
pass by reason of the likeness of this orbit which a body acted upon
by an uniform centripetal force describes, and of that orbit which a
body performing its circuits in a revolving ellipsis will describe in a
quiescent plane. By this collation of the terms, these orbits are made
similar; not universally, indeed, but then only when they approach very
near to a circular figure. A body, therefore revolving with an uniform
centripetal force in an orbit nearly circular, will always describe an
angle of <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{180}{\sqrt{3}}" src="images/178.svg" style="vertical-align: -2.308ex; width: 4.389ex; height: 5.344ex;" id="img_images_178.svg_1"> deg., or 103 deg., 55 m., 23 sec.,
at the centre; moving from the upper apsis to the lower apsis when it
has once described that angle, and thence returning to the upper apsis

FF as <i>b</i>T<sup>m - 1</sup> + <i>c</i>T<sup>n - 1</sup> to <i>mb</i>T<sup>n - 1</sup>
+ <i>nc</i>T<sup>n - 1</sup>. This proportion, by expressing the greatest
altitude CV or T arithmetically by unity, becomes, GG to FF as

And therefore since the angle VCP between the upper
and the lower apsis, in an immovable ellipsis, is of 180 deg., the
angle VC<i>p</i> between the same apsides in an orbit which a body
describes with a centripetal force, that is, as 
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{b\mathrm{A}^{m} + c\mathrm{A}^{n}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/197.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 11.845ex; height: 4.777ex;" id="img_images_197.svg_1">,</span>

reasoning, if the centripetal force be as 
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{b\mathrm{A}^{m} -c\mathrm{A}^{n}}{\mathrm{A}^{3}}" src="images/204.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.627ex; width: 11.845ex; height: 4.777ex;" id="img_images_204.svg">,</span>

same manner the Problem is solved in more difficult cases. The quantity
to which the centripetal force is proportional must always be resolved
into a converging series whose denominator is A<sup>3</sup>. Then the given
part of the numerator arising from that operation is to be supposed
in the same ratio to that part of it which is not given, as the given
part of this numerator RGG - RFF + TFF - FFX is to that part of the
same numerator which is not given. And taking away the superfluous
quantities, and writing unity for T, the proportion of G to F is
obtained.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if the centripetal force be as any power of the altitude,
that power may be found from the motion of the apsides; and so
contrariwise. That is, if the whole angular motion, with which the body
returns to the same apsis, be to the angular motion of one revolution,
or 360 deg., as any number as <i>m</i> to another as <i>n</i>, and
the altitude called A; the force will be as the power <img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{A}^{\tfrac{nn}{mm} -3}" src="images/206.svg" style="vertical-align: 0; width: 7.734ex; height: 2.647ex;" id="img_images_206.svg">
of the altitude A; the index of which power is <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{nn}{mm} -3" src="images/207.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 8.865ex; height: 4.106ex;" id="img_images_207.svg">.</span>
This appears by the second example. Hence it is plain that the
force in its recess from the centre cannot decrease in a greater than
a triplicate ratio of the altitude. A body revolving with such a
force, and parting from the apsis, if it once begins to descend, can
never arrive at the lower apsis or least altitude, but will descend
to the centre, describing the curve line treated of in Cor. 3, Prop.
XLI. But if it should, at its parting from the lower apsis, begin to
ascend never so little, it will ascend <i>in infinitum</i>, and never
come to the upper apsis; but will describe the curve line spoken of
in the same Cor., and Cor. 6, Prop. XLIV. So that where the force in
its recess from the centre decreases in a greater than a triplicate
ratio of the altitude, the body at its parting from the apsis,
will either descend to the centre, or ascend <i>in infinitum</i>,
according as it descends or ascends at the beginning of its motion.
But if the force in its recess from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span> the centre either decreases in
a less than a triplicate ratio of the altitude, or increases in any
ratio of the altitude whatsoever, the body will never descend to
the centre, but will at some time arrive at the lower apsis; and,
on the contrary, if the body alternately ascending and descending
from one apsis to another never comes to the centre, then either the
force increases in the recess from the centre, or it decreases in
a less than a triplicate ratio of the altitude; and the sooner the
body returns from one apsis to another, the farther is the ratio of
the forces from the triplicate ratio. As if the body should return
to and from the upper apsis by an alternate descent and ascent in 8
revolutions, or in 4, or 2, or <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/208.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_208.svg">;</span> that is, if <i>m</i>

44 sec., and this angular motion being repeated, will return to the
upper apsis; and therefore the upper apsis in each revolution will go

as swift.</p>

<p>So much for the motion of bodies in orbits whose planes pass through
the centre of force. It now remains to determine those motions in
eccentrical planes. For those authors who treat of the motion of heavy
bodies used to consider the ascent and descent of such bodies, not
only in a perpendicular direction, but at all degrees of obliquity
upon any given planes; and for the same reason we are to consider in
this place the motions of bodies tending to centres by means of any
forces whatsoever, when those bodies move in eccentrical planes. These
planes are supposed to be perfectly smooth and polished, so as not
to retard the motion of the bodies in the least. Moreover, in these
demonstrations, instead of the planes upon which those bodies roll or
slide, and which are therefore tangent planes to the bodies, I shall
use planes parallel to them, in which the centres of the bodies move,
and by that motion describe orbits. And by the same method I afterwards
determine the motions of bodies performed in curve superficies.</p>

<p>Let S be the centre of force, SC the least distance of that centre from
the given plane, P a body issuing from the place P in the direction of
the right line PZ, Q the same body revolving in its trajectory, and PQR
the trajectory itself which is required to be found, described in that
given plane. Join CQ, QS, and if in QS we take SV proportional to the
centripetal force with which the body is attracted towards the centre
S, and draw VT parallel to CQ, and meeting SC in T; then will the force
SV be resolved into two (by Cor. 2, of the Laws of Motion), the force
ST, and the force TV; of which ST attracting the body in the direction
of a line perpendicular to that plane, does not at all change its
motion in that plane. But the action of the other force TV, coinciding
with the position of the plane itself, attracts the body directly
towards the given point C in that plane; and therefore causes the body
to move in this plane in the same manner as if the force ST were taken
away, and the body were to revolve in free space about the centre C
by means of the force TV alone. But there being given the centripetal
force TV with which the body Q revolves in free space about the given
centre C, there is given (by Prop. XLII) the trajectory PQR which the
body describes; the place Q, in which the body will be found at any
given time; and, lastly, the velocity of the body in that place Q. And
so è contra. Q.E.I.</p>

</div>

<p>For letting all things stand as in the foregoing Proposition, the force
SV, with which the body Q revolving in any plane PQR is attracted
towards the centre S, is as the distance SQ; and therefore because SV
and SQ, TV and CQ are proportional, the force TV with which the body
is attracted towards the given point C in the plane of the orbit is as
the distance CQ. Therefore the forces with which bodies found in the
plane PQR are attracted towards the point C, are in proportion to the
distances equal to the forces with which the same bodies are attracted
every way towards the centre S; and therefore the bodies will move
in the same times, and in the same figures, in any plane PQR about
the point C, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span> would do in free spaces about the centre S; and
therefore (by Cor. 2, Prop. X, and Cor. 2, Prop. XXXVIII.) they will in
equal times either describe ellipses in that plane about the centre C,
or move to and fro in right lines passing through the centre C in that
plane; completing the same periods of time in all cases. Q.E.D.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>The ascent and descent of bodies in curve superficies has a near
relation to these motions we have been speaking of. Imagine curve
lines to be described on any plane, and to revolve about any given
axes passing through the centre of force, and by that revolution to
describe curve superficies; and that the bodies move in such sort
that their centres may be always found in those superficies. If those
bodies reciprocate to and fro with an oblique ascent and descent,
their motions will be performed in planes passing through the axis,
and therefore in the curve lines, by whose revolution those curve
superficies were generated. In those cases, therefore, it will be
sufficient to consider the motion in those curve lines.</p>

to revolve in such a manner that the arcs AB, PB may be always equal
one to the other, and the given point P in the perimeter of the wheel
may describe in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span> mean time the curvilinear path AP. Let AP be the
whole curvilinear path described since the wheel touched the globe in
A, and the length of this path AP will be to twice the versed sine of
the arc <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{PB}" src="images/247.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.938ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_247.svg"> as 2CE to CB. For let the right
line CE (produced if need be) meet the wheel in V, and join CP, BP,
EP, VP; produce CP, and let fall thereon the perpendicular VF. Let PH,
VH, meeting in H, touch the circle in P and V, and let PH cut VF in G,
and to VP let fall the perpendiculars GI, HK. From the centre C with
any interval let there be described the circle <i>nom</i>, cutting the

and the curvilinear path AP in <i>m</i>; and from the centre V with the
interval V<i>o</i> let there be described a circle cutting VP produced
in <i>q</i>.</p>

<p>Because the wheel in its progress always revolves about the point of
contact B, it is manifest that the right line BP is perpendicular
to that curve line AP which the point P of the wheel describes, and
therefore that the right line VP will touch this curve in the point
P. Let the radius of the circle <i>nom</i> be gradually increased or
diminished so that at last it become equal to the distance CP; and by
reason of the similitude of the evanescent figure P<i>nomq</i>, and the
figure PFGVI, the ultimate ratio of the evanescent lineolæ P<i>m</i>,
P<i>n</i>, P<i>o</i>, P<i>q</i>, that is, the ratio of the momentary

the right line VP, will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span> the same as of the lines PV, PF, PG, PI,
respectively. But since VF is perpendicular to CF, and VH to CV, and
therefore the angles HVG, VCF equal; and the angle VHG (because the
angles of the quadrilateral figure HVEP are right in V and P) is equal
to the angle CEP, the triangles VHG, CEP will be similar; and thence
it will come to pass that as EP is to CE so is HG to HV or HP, and
so KI to KP, and by composition or division as CB to CE so is PI to
PK, and doubling the consequents as CB to 2CE so PI to PV, and so is
P<i>q</i> to P<i>m</i>. Therefore the decrement of the line VP, that
is, the increment of the line BV - VP to the increment of the curve
line AP is in a given ratio of CB to 2CE, and therefore (by Cor. Lem.

motion tends, and fold itself round that curve line, as if it were some
solid obstacle, the remaining part of the same thread PT which has not
yet touched the semi-cycloid continuing straight. Then will the weight
T oscillate in the given cycloid QRS. Q.E.F.</p>

<p>For let the thread PT meet the cycloid QRS in T, and the circle QOS in
V, and let CV be drawn; and to the rectilinear part of the thread PT
from the extreme points P and T let there be erected the perpendiculars
BP, TW, meeting the right line CV in B and W. It is evident, from the
construction and generation of the similar figures AS, SR, that those
perpendiculars PB, TW, cut off from CV the lengths VB, VW equal the
diameters of the wheels OA, OR. Therefore TP is to VP (which is double
the sine of the angle VBP when <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{BV}" src="images/249.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.094ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_249.svg_1"> is radius)
as BW to BV, or AO + OR to AO, that is (since CA and CO, CO and CR, and
by division AO and OR are proportional), as CA + CO to CA, or, if BV
be bisected in E, as 2CE to CB. Therefore (by Cor. 1, Prop. XLIX), the
length of the rectilinear part of the thread PT is always equal to the
arc of the cycloid PS, and the whole thread APT is always equal to the
half of the cycloid APS, that is (by Cor. 2, Prop. XLIX), to the length
AR. And therefore contrariwise, if the string remain always equal to
the length AR, the point T will always move in the given cycloid QRS.
Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. The string AR is equal to the semi-cycloid AS, and therefore has
the same ratio to AC the semi-diameter of the exterior globe as the
like semi-cycloid SR has to CO the semi-diameter of the interior globe.</p>

<p>For upon the tangent TW infinitely produced let fall the perpendicular
CX, and join CT. Because the centripetal force with which the body T
is impelled towards C is as the distance CT, let this (by Cor. 2, of
the Laws) be resolved into the parts CX, TX, of which CX impelling the
body directly from P stretches the thread PT, and by the resistance
the thread makes to it is totally employed, producing no other effect;
but the other part TX, impelling the body transversely or towards X,
directly accelerates the motion in the cycloid. Then it is plain that
the acceleration of the body, proportional to this accelerating force,
will be every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span> moment as the length TX, that is (because CV, WV, and
TX, TW proportional to them are given), as the length TW, that is (by
Cor. 1, Prop. XLIX) as the length of the arc of the cycloid TR. If
therefore two pendulums APT, A<i>pt</i>, be unequally drawn aside from
the perpendicular AR, and let fall together, their accelerations will
be always as the arcs to be described TR, <i>t</i>R. But the parts
described at the beginning of the motion are as the accelerations,
that is, as the wholes that are to be described at the beginning, and
therefore the parts which remain to be described, and the subsequent
accelerations proportional to those parts, are also as the wholes, and
so on. Therefore the accelerations, and consequently the velocities
generated, and the parts described with those velocities, and the parts
to be described, are always as the wholes; and therefore the parts
to be described preserving a given ratio to each other will vanish
together, that is, the two bodies oscillating will arrive together
at the perpendicular AR. And since on the other hand the ascent of
the pendulums from the lowest place R through the same cycloidal arcs
with a retrograde motion, is retarded in the several places they pass
through by the same forces by which their descent was accelerated; it
is plain that the velocities of their ascent and descent through the
same arcs are equal, and consequently performed in equal times; and,
therefore, since the two parts of the cycloid RS and RQ lying on either
side of the perpendicular are similar and equal, the two pendulums will
perform as well the wholes as the halves of their oscillations in the
same times. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. The force with which the body T is accelerated or retarded in any
place T of the cycloid, is to the whole weight of the same body in the

HIK equal to the centripetal force in the perimeter of the globe QOS

LG, and therefore if TR and LG are equal, are also equal in the places

Therefore by Prop. XXXVIII, the time in which the body describes the
arc ST is to the time of one oscillation, as the arc HI the time in
which the body H arrives at L, to the semi-periphery HKM, the time in
which the body H will come to M. And the velocity of the pendulous
body in the place T is to its velocity in the lowest place R, that
is, the velocity of the body H in the place L to its velocity in the
place G, or the momentary increment of the line HL to the momentary
increment of the line HG (the arcs HI, HK increasing with an equable
flux) as the ordinate LI to the radius GK, or as <img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{\mathrm{SR}^{2} - \mathrm{TR}^{2}}" src="images/250.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.276ex; width: 13.27ex; height: 2.851ex;" id="img_images_250.svg">
to SR. Hence, since in unequal oscillations there
are described in equal time arcs proportional to the entire arcs of
the oscillations, there are obtained from the times given, both the
velocities and the arcs described in all the oscillations universally.
Which was first required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>Let now any pendulous bodies oscillate in different cycloids described
within different globes, whose absolute forces are also different; and
if the absolute force of any globe QOS be called V, the accelerative
force with which the pendulum is acted on in the circumference of
this globe, when it begins to move directly towards its centre, will
be as the distance of the pendulous body from that centre and the
absolute force of the globe conjunctly, that is, as CO × V. Therefore
the lineola HY, which is as this accelerated force CO × V, will be
described in a given time; and if there be erected the perpendicular
YZ meeting the circumference in Z, the nascent arc HZ will denote
that given time. But that nascent arc HZ is in the subduplicate
ratio of the rectangle GHY, and therefore as 
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{\mathrm{GH} \times\, \mathrm{CO} \times\, \mathrm V}" src="images/251.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.206ex; width: 16.78ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_251.svg">.</span>
Whence the time of an entire oscillation in the cycloid QRS (it being
as the semi-periphery HKM, which denotes that entire oscillation,
directly; and as the arc HZ which in like manner denotes a given time
inversely) will be as GH directly and <img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{\mathrm{GH} \times\,\mathrm{CO} \times\, \mathrm V}" src="images/252.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.206ex; width: 16.78ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_252.svg">
inversely; that is, because GH and SR are equal, as
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{\dfrac{\mathrm{SR}}{\mathrm{CO} \times\, \mathrm {V}}}" src="images/253.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.801ex; width: 11.537ex; height: 5.566ex;" id="img_images_253.svg">,</span>

Therefore the oscillations in all globes and cycloids, performed
with what absolute forces soever, are in a ratio compounded of the
subduplicate ratio of the length of the string directly, and the
subduplicate ratio of the distance between the point of suspension and
the centre of the globe inversely, and the subduplicate ratio of the
absolute force of the globe inversely also. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence also the times of oscillating, falling, and revolving
bodies may be compared among themselves. For if the diameter of
the wheel with which the cycloid is described within the globe is
supposed equal to the semi-diameter of the globe, the cycloid will
become a right line passing through the centre of the globe, and the
oscillation will be changed into a descent and subsequent ascent in
that right line. Whence there is given both the time of the descent
from any place to the centre, and the time equal to it in which
the body revolving uniformly about the centre of the globe at any
distance describes an arc of a quadrant. For this time (by Case 2)
is to the time of half the oscillation in any cycloid QRS as 1 to
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{\dfrac{\mathrm{AR}}{\mathrm{AC}}}" src="images/255.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.787ex; width: 6.665ex; height: 5.566ex;" id="img_images_255.svg">.</span></p>

<p>COR. 2. Hence also follow what Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i> and M.
<i>Huygens</i> have discovered concerning the vulgar cycloid. For
if the diameter of the globe be infinitely increased, its spherical
superficies will be changed into a plane, and the centripetal force
will act uniformly in the direction of lines perpendicular to that
plane, and this cycloid of our's will become the same with the common
cycloid. But in that case the length of the arc of the cycloid between
that plane and the describing point will become equal to four times the
versed sine of half the arc of the wheel between the same plane and the
describing point, as was discovered by Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i>. And
a pendulum between two such cycloids will oscillate in a similar and
equal cycloid in equal times, as M. <i>Huygens</i> demonstrated. The
descent of heavy bodies also in the time of one oscillation will be the
same as M. <i>Huygens</i> exhibited.</p>

<p>The propositions here demonstrated are adapted to the true constitution
of the Earth, in so far as wheels moving in any of its great circles
will describe, by the motions of nails fixed in their perimeters,
cycloids without the globe; and pendulums, in mines and deep caverns
of the Earth, must oscillate in cycloids within the globe, that those
oscillations may be performed in equal times. For gravity (as will be
shewn in the third book) decreases in its progress from the superficies
of the Earth; upwards in a duplicate ratio of the distances from the
centre of the Earth; downwards in a simple ratio of the same.</p>

perpendicular to the tangent. Draw CT meeting that perpendicular in Z,
and the centripetal force will be proportional to the right line TZ.

<p>For if the force with which the body is attracted from T towards C be
expressed by the right line TZ taken proportional to it, that force
will be resolved into two forces TY, YZ, of which YZ drawing the body
in the direction of the length of the thread PT, does not at all change
its motion; whereas the other force TY directly accelerates or retards
its motion in the curve STRQ. Wherefore since that force is as the
space to be described TR, the accelerations or retardations of the body
in describing two proportional parts (a greater and a less) of two
oscillations, will be always as those parts, and therefore will cause
those parts to be described together. But bodies which continually
describe together parts proportional to the wholes, will describe the
wholes together also. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if the body T, hanging by a rectilinear thread AT from
the centre A, describe the circular arc STRQ, and in the mean time
be acted on by any force tending downwards with parallel directions,
which is to the uniform force of gravity as the arc TR to its sine TN,
the times of the several oscillations will be equal. For because TZ,
AR are parallel, the triangles ATN, ZTY are similar; and therefore TZ
will be to AT as TY to TN; that is, if the uniform force of gravity
be expressed by the given length AT, the force TZ, by which the
oscillations become isochronous, will be to the force of gravity AT, as
the arc TR equal to TY is to TN the sine of that arc.</p>

machine upon the pendulum which preserves the motion, and so compounded
with the force of gravity that the whole force tending downwards should
be always as a line produced by applying the rectangle under the arc

</div>

<p>I have hitherto been treating of the attractions of bodies towards an
immovable centre; though very probably there is no such thing existent
in nature. For attractions are made towards bodies, and the actions of
the bodies attracted and attracting are always reciprocal and equal,
by Law III; so that if there are two bodies, neither the attracted
nor the attracting body is truly at rest, but both (by Cor. 4, of the
Laws of Motion), being as it were mutually attracted, revolve about a
common centre of gravity. And if there be more bodies, which are either
attracted by one single one which is attracted by them again, or which
all of them, attract each other mutually, these bodies will be so moved
among themselves, as that their common centre of gravity will either be
at rest, or move uniformly forward in a right line. I shall therefore
at present go on to treat of the motion of bodies mutually attracting
each other; considering the centripetal forces as attractions; though
perhaps in a physical strictness they may more truly be called
impulses. But these propositions are to be considered as purely
mathematical; and therefore, laying aside all physical considerations,
I make use of a familiar way of speaking, to make myself the more
easily understood by a mathematical reader.</p>

their common term with an equable angular motion, because lying in
the same right line they never change their inclination to each other
mutually. But right lines that are in a given ratio to each other, and
revolve about their terms with an equal angular motion, describe upon

<p>Let the bodies S and P revolve about their common centre of gravity C,
proceeding from S to T, and from P to Q. From the given point <i>s</i>
let there be continually drawn <i>sp</i>, <i>sq</i>, equal and parallel
to SP, TQ; and the curve <i>pqv</i>, which the point <i>p</i> describes
in its revolution round the immovable point <i>s</i>, will be similar
and equal to the curves which the bodies S and P describe about each
other mutually; and therefore, by Theor. XX, similar to the curves ST
and PQV which the same bodies describe about their common centre of
gravity C; and that because the proportions of the lines SC, CP, and SP
or <i>sp</i>, to each other, are given.</p>

<p>CASE 1. The common centre of gravity C (by Cor. 4, of the Laws of
Motion) is either at rest, or moves uniformly in a right line. Let
us first suppose it at rest, and in <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> let there
be placed two bodies, one immovable in <i>s</i>, the other movable
in <i>p</i>, similar and equal to the bodies S and P. Then let the
right lines PR and <i>pr</i> touch the curves PQ and <i>pq</i> in P
and <i>p</i>, and produce CQ and <i>sq</i> to R and r. And because
the figures CPRQ, <i>sprq</i> are similar, RQ will be to <i>rq</i>
as CP to <i>sp</i>, and therefore in a given ratio. Hence if the
force with which the body P is attracted towards the body S, and by
consequence towards the intermediate point the centre C, were to the
force with which the body <i>p</i> is attracted towards the centre
<i>s</i>, in the same given ratio, these forces would in equal times
attract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span> the bodies from the tangents PR, <i>pr</i> to the arcs PQ,
<i>pq</i>, through the intervals proportional to them RQ, <i>rq</i>;
and therefore this last force (tending to <i>s</i>) would make the
body <i>p</i> revolve in the curve <i>pqv</i>, which would become
similar to the curve PQV, in which the first force obliges the body P
to revolve; and their revolutions would be completed in the same times.
But because those forces are not to each other in the ratio of CP to
<i>sp</i>, but (by reason of the similarity and equality of the bodies
S and <i>s</i>, P and <i>p</i> and the equality of the distances SP,
<i>sp</i>) mutually equal, the bodies in equal times will be equally
drawn from the tangents; and therefore that the body <i>p</i> may be
attracted through the greater interval <i>rq</i>, there is required a
greater time, which will be in the subduplicate ratio of the intervals;
because, by Lemma X, the spaces described at the very beginning of
the motion are in a duplicate ratio of the times. Suppose, then the
velocity of the body <i>p</i> to be to the velocity of the body P in
a subduplicate ratio of the distance <i>sp</i> to the distance CP, so
that the arcs <i>pq</i>, PQ, which are in a simple proportion to each
other, may be described in times that are in a subduplicate ratio of
the distances; and the bodies P, <i>p</i>, always attracted by equal
forces, will describe round the quiescent centres C and <i>s</i>
similar figures PQV, <i>pqv</i>, the latter of which <i>pqv</i> is
similar and equal to the figure which the body P describes round the
movable body S. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 2. Suppose now that the common centre of gravity, together with
the space in which the bodies are moved among themselves, proceeds
uniformly in a right line; and (by Cor. 6, of the Laws of Motion) all
the motions in this space will be performed in the same manner as
before; and therefore the bodies will describe mutually about each
other the same figures as before, which will be therefore similar and
equal to the figure <i>pqv</i>. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence two bodies attracting each other with forces proportional
to their distance, describe (by Prop. X) both round their common centre
of gravity, and round each other mutually concentrical ellipses; and,
<i>vice versa</i>, if such figures are described, the forces are
proportional to the distances.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And two bodies, whose forces are reciprocally proportional to
the square of their distance, describe (by Prop. XI, XII, XIII), both
round their common centre of gravity, and round each other mutually,
conic sections having their focus in the centre about which the figures
are described. And, <i>vice versa</i>, if such figures are described,
the centripetal forces are reciprocally proportional to the squares of
the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>COR. 3. Any two bodies revolving round their common centre of gravity
describe areas proportional to the times, by radii drawn both to that
centre and to each other mutually.</p>

<p>Suppose the first two bodies T and L to have their common centre of
gravity in D. These, by Cor. 1, Theor. XXI, will describe ellipses
having their centres in D, the magnitudes of which ellipses are known
by Prob. V.</p>

<p>Let now a third body S attract the two former T and L with the
accelerative forces ST, SL, and let it be attracted again by them. The
force ST (by Cor. 2, of the Laws of Motion) is resolved into the forces
SD, DT; and the force SL into the forces SD and DL. Now the forces DT,
DL, which are as their sum TL, and therefore as the accelerative forces
with which the bodies T and L attract each other mutually, added to
the forces of the bodies T and L, the first to the first, and the last
to the last, compose forces proportional to the distances DT and DL as
before, but only greater than those former forces: and therefore (by
Cor. 1, Prop. X, and Cor. 1, and 8, Prop. IV) they will cause those
bodies to describe ellipses as before, but with a swifter motion. The
remaining accelerative forces SD and DL, by the motive forces SD × T
and SD × L, which are as the bodies attracting those bodies equally
and in the direction of the lines TI, LK parallel to DS, do not at
all change their situations with respect to one another, but cause
them equally to approach to the line IK; which must be imagined drawn
through the middle of the body S, and perpendicular to the line DS. But
that approach to the line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span> IK will be hindered by causing the system
of the bodies T and L on one side, and the body S on the other, with
proper velocities, to revolve round the common centre of gravity C.
With such a motion the body S, because the sum of the motive forces SD
× T and SD × L is proportional to the distance CS, tends to the centre
C, will describe an ellipsis round the same centre C; and the point
D, because the lines CS and CD are proportional, will describe a like
ellipsis over against it. But the bodies T and L, attracted by the
motive forces SD × T and SD × L, the first by the first, and the last
by the last, equally and in the direction of the parallel lines TI and
LK, as was said before, will (by Cor. 5 and 6, of the Laws of Motion)
continue to describe their ellipses round the movable centre D, as
before. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>Let there be added a fourth body V, and, by the like reasoning, it will
be demonstrated that this body and the point C will describe ellipses
about the common centre of gravity B; the motions of the bodies T,
L, and S round the centres D and C remaining the same as before; but
accelerated. And by the same method one may add yet more bodies at
pleasure. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>This would be the case, though the bodies T and L attract each other
mutually with accelerative forces either greater or less than those
with which they attract the other bodies in proportion to their
distance. Let all the mutual accelerative attractions be to each other
as the distances multiplied into the attracting bodies; and from what
has gone before it will easily be concluded that all the bodies will
describe different ellipses with equal periodical times about their
common centre of gravity B, in an immovable plane. Q.E.I.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION LXV. THEOREM XXV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Bodies, whose forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of their
distances from their centres, may move among themselves in ellipses;
and by radii drawn to the foci may describe areas proportional to the
times very nearly.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the last Proposition we demonstrated that case in which the motions
will be performed exactly in ellipses. The more distant the law of the
forces is from the law in that case, the more will the bodies disturb
each other's motions; neither is it possible that bodies attracting
each other mutually according to the law supposed in this Proposition
should move exactly in ellipses, unless by keeping a certain proportion
of distances from each other. However, in the following cases the
orbits will not much differ from ellipses.</p>

<p>CASE 1. Imagine several lesser bodies to revolve about some very great
one at different distances from it, and suppose absolute forces tending
to every one of the bodies proportional to each. And because (by Cor.
4, of the Laws) the common centre of gravity of them all is either at
rest, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span> moves uniformly forward in a right line, suppose the lesser
bodies so small that the great body may be never at a sensible distance
from that centre; and then the great body will, without any sensible
error, be either at rest, or move uniformly forward in a right line;
and the lesser will revolve about that great one in ellipses, and by
radii drawn thereto will describe areas proportional to the times; if
we except the errors that may be introduced by the receding of the
great body from the common centre of gravity, or by the mutual actions
of the lesser bodies upon each other. But the lesser bodies may be
so far diminished, as that this recess and the mutual actions of the
bodies on each other may become less than any assignable; and therefore
so as that the orbits may become ellipses, and the areas answer to the
times, without any error that is not less than any assignable. Q.E.O.</p>

<p>CASE 2. Let us imagine a system of lesser bodies revolving about a very
great one in the manner just described, or any other system of two
bodies revolving about each other to be moving uniformly forward in a
right line, and in the mean time to be impelled sideways by the force
of another vastly greater body situate at a great distance. And because
the equal accelerative forces with which the bodies are impelled in
parallel directions do not change the situation of the bodies with
respect to each other, but only oblige the whole system to change its
place while the parts still retain their motions among themselves, it
is manifest that no change in those motions of the attracted bodies
can arise from their attractions towards the greater, unless by the
inequality of the accelerative attractions, or by the inclinations of
the lines towards each other, in whose directions the attractions are
made. Suppose, therefore, all the accelerative attractions made towards
the great body to be among themselves as the squares of the distances
reciprocally; and then, by increasing the distance of the great body
till the differences of the right lines drawn from that to the others
in respect of their length, and the inclinations of those lines to
each other, be less than any given, the motions of the parts of the
system will continue without errors that are not less than any given.
And because, by the small distance of those parts from each other, the
whole system is attracted as if it were but one body, it will therefore
be moved by this attraction as if it were one body; that is, its centre
of gravity will describe about the great body one of the conic sections
(that is, a parabola or hyperbola when the attraction is but languid
and an ellipsis when it is more vigorous); and by radii drawn thereto,
it will describe areas proportional to the times, without any errors
but those which arise from the distances of the parts, which are by the
supposition exceedingly small, and may be diminished at pleasure. Q.E.O.</p>

<p>By a like reasoning one may proceed to more compounded cases <i>in
infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 1. In the second Case, the nearer the very great body approaches
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span> the system of two or more revolving bodies, the greater will
the perturbation be of the motions of the parts of the system among
themselves; because the inclinations of the lines drawn from that
great body to those parts become greater; and the inequality of the
proportion is also greater.</p>

<p>COR. 2. But the perturbation will be greatest of all, if we suppose
the accelerative attractions of the parts of the system towards the
greatest body of all are not to each other reciprocally as the squares
of the distances from that great body; especially if the inequality of
this proportion be greater than the inequality of the proportion of the
distances from the great body. For if the accelerative force, acting in
parallel directions and equally, causes no perturbation in the motions
of the parts of the system, it must of course, when it acts unequally,
cause a perturbation somewhere, which will be greater or less as the
inequality is greater or less. The excess of the greater impulses
acting upon some bodies, and not acting upon others, must necessarily
change their situation among themselves. And this perturbation, added
to the perturbation arising from the inequality and inclination of the
lines, makes the whole perturbation greater.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Hence if the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles
without any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are
at all impelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the
impulse is very weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in
parallel directions upon all of them.</p>

drawn to the innermost and greatest, describe round that body areas

if that great body be agitated by those attractions, than it would
do if that great body were not attracted at all by the lesser, but
remained at rest; or than it would if that great body were very much
more or very much less attracted, or very much more or very much less
agitated, by the attractions.</i></p>

<p>This appears plainly enough from the demonstration of the second
Corollary of the foregoing Proposition; but it may be made out after
this manner by a way of reasoning more distinct and more universally
convincing.</p>

</figure>

<p>CASE 1. Let the lesser bodies P and S revolve in the same plane about
the greatest body T, the body P describing the interior orbit PAB, and
S<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span> the exterior orbit ESE. Let SK be the mean distance of the bodies
P and S; and let the accelerative attraction of the body P towards S,
at that mean distance, be expressed by that line SK. Make SL to SK as
the square of SK to the square of SP, and SL will be the accelerative
attraction of the body P towards S at any distance SP. Join PT, and
draw LM parallel to it meeting ST in M; and the attraction SL will
be resolved (by Cor. 2, of the Laws of Motion) into the attractions
SM, LM. And so the body P will be urged with a threefold accelerative
force. One of these forces tends towards T, and arises from the mutual
attraction of the bodies T and P. By this force alone the body P would
describe round the body T, by the radius PT, areas proportional to the
times, and an ellipsis whose focus is in the centre of the body T; and
this it would do whether the body T remained unmoved, or whether it
were agitated by that attraction. This appears from Prop. XI, and Cor.
2 and 3 of Theor. XXI. The other force is that of the attraction LM,
which, because it tends from P to T, will be superadded to and coincide
with the former force; and cause the areas to be still proportional to
the times, by Cor. 3, Theor. XXI. But because it is not reciprocally
proportional to the square of the distance PT, it will compose, when
added to the former, a force varying from that proportion; which
variation will be the greater by how much the proportion of this force
to the former is greater, <i>cæteris paribus</i>. Therefore, since by
Prop. XI, and by Cor. 2, Theor. XXI, the force with which the ellipsis
is described about the focus T ought to be directed to that focus, and
to be reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance PT, that
compounded force varying from that proportion will make the orbit PAB
vary from the figure of an ellipsis that has its focus in the point T;
and so much the more by how much the variation from that proportion is
greater; and by consequence by how much the proportion of the second
force LM to the first force is greater, <i>cæteris paribus</i>. But
now the third force SM, attracting the body P in a direction parallel
to ST, composes with the other forces a new force which is no longer
directed from P to T; and which varies so much more from this direction
by how much the proportion of this third force to the other forces
is greater, <i>cæteris paribus</i>; and therefore causes the body P
to describe, by the radius TP, areas no longer proportional to the
times; and therefore makes the variation from that proportionality so
much greater by how much the proportion of this force to the others is
greater. But this third force will increase the variation of the orbit
PAB from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span> elliptical figure before-mentioned upon two accounts;
first because that force is not directed from P to T; and, secondly,
because it is not reciprocally proportional to the square of the
distance PT. These things being premised, it is manifest that the areas
are then most nearly proportional to the times, when that third force
is the least possible, the rest preserving their former quantity; and
that the orbit PAB does then approach nearest to the elliptical figure
above-mentioned, when both the second and third, but especially the
third force, is the least possible; the first force remaining in its
former quantity.</p>

<p>Let the accelerative attraction of the body T towards S be expressed by
the line SN; then if the accelerative attractions SM and SN were equal,
these, attracting the bodies T and P equally and in parallel directions
would not at all change their situation with respect to each other.
The motions of the bodies between themselves would be the same in that
case as if those attractions did not act at all, by Cor. 6, of the Laws
of Motion. And, by a like reasoning, if the attraction SN is less than
the attraction SM, it will take away out of the attraction SM the part
SN, so that there will remain only the part (of the attraction) MN to
disturb the proportionality of the areas and times, and the elliptical
figure of the orbit. And in like manner if the attraction SN be greater
than the attraction SM, the perturbation of the orbit and proportion
will be produced by the difference MN alone. After this manner the
attraction SN reduces always the attraction SM to the attraction MN,
the first and second attractions remaining perfectly unchanged; and
therefore the areas and times come then nearest to proportionality,
and the orbit PAB to the above-mentioned elliptical figure, when the
attraction MN is either none, or the least that is possible; that
is, when the accelerative attractions of the bodies P and T approach
as near as possible to equality; that is, when the attraction SN is
neither none at all, nor less than the least of all the attractions
SM, but is, as it were, a mean between the greatest and least of all
those attractions SM, that is, not much greater nor much less than the
attraction SK. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 2. Let now the lesser bodies P, S, revolve about a greater T in
different planes; and the force LM, acting in the direction of the line
PT situate in the plane of the orbit PAB, will have the same effect as
before; neither will it draw the body P from the plane of its orbit.
But the other force NM acting in the direction of a line parallel to ST
(and which, therefore, when the body S is without the line of the nodes
is inclined to the plane of the orbit PAB), besides the perturbation
of the motion just now spoken of as to longitude, introduces another
perturbation also as to latitude, attracting the body P out of the
plane of its orbit. And this perturbation, in any given situation of
the bodies P and T to each other, will be as the generating force MN;
and therefore becomes least when the force MN is least, that is (as was
just now shewn), where the attraction SN is not much greater nor much
less than the attraction SK. Q.E.D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence it may be easily collected, that if several less bodies
P S, R, &amp;c., revolve about a very great body T, the motion of the
innermost revolving body P will be least disturbed by the attractions
of the others, when the great body is as well attracted and agitated
by the rest (according to the ratio of the accelerative forces) as the
rest are by each other mutually.</p>

<p>COR. 2. In a system of three bodies, T, P, S, if the accelerative
attractions of any two of them towards a third be to each other
reciprocally as the squares of the distances, the body P, by the
radius PT, will describe its area about the body T swifter near the
conjunction A and the opposition B than it will near the quadratures
C and D. For every force with which the body P is acted on and the
body T is not, and which does not act in the direction of the line
PT, does either accelerate or retard the description of the area,
according as it is directed, whether <i>in consequentia</i> or <i>in
antecedentia</i>. Such is the force NM. This force in the passage
of the body P from C to A is directed <i>in consequentia</i> to
its motion, and therefore accelerates it; then as far as D <i>in
antecedentia</i>, and retards the motion; then <i>in consequentia</i>
as far as B; and lastly <i>in antecedentia</i> as it moves from B to C.</p>

<p>COR. 3. And from the same reasoning it appears that the body P
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, moves more swiftly in the conjunction and
opposition than in the quadratures.</p>

<p>COR. 4. The orbit of the body P, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, is more curve
at the quadratures than at the conjunction and opposition. For the
swifter bodies move, the less they deflect from a rectilinear path.
And besides the force KL, or NM, at the conjunction and opposition, is
contrary to the force with which the body T attracts the body P, and
therefore diminishes that force; but the body P will deflect the less
from a rectilinear path the less it is impelled towards the body T.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width500" style="width: 500px;" id="i_205">
<img alt="Body P’s orbit curves more at quadratures than conjunctions or oppositions; faster bodies deviate less from straight paths due to opposing forces reducing attraction." height="148" src="images/i_205.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i_205.jpg">
</figure>

<p>COR. 5. Hence the body P, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, goes farther from
the body T at the quadratures than at the conjunction and opposition.
This is said, however, supposing no regard had to the motion of
eccentricity. For if the orbit of the body P be eccentrical, its
eccentricity (as will be shewn presently by Cor. 9) will be greatest
when the apsides are in the syzygies; and thence it may sometimes come
to pass that the body P, in its near approach to the farther apsis, may
go farther from the body T at the syzygies than at the quadratures.</p>

<p>COR. 6. Because the centripetal force of the central body T, by which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
the body P is retained in its orbit, is increased at the quadratures
by the addition caused by the force LM, and diminished at the syzygies
by the subduction caused by the force KL, and, because the force
KL is greater than LM, it is more diminished than increased; and,
moreover, since that centripetal force (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV) is in a
ratio compounded of the simple ratio of the radius TP directly, and
the duplicate ratio of the periodical time inversely; it is plain that
this compounded ratio is diminished by the action of the force KL; and
therefore that the periodical time, supposing the radius of the orbit
PT to remain the same, will be increased, and that in the subduplicate
of that ratio in which the centripetal force is diminished; and,
therefore, supposing this radius increased or diminished, the
periodical time will be increased more or diminished less than in the
sesquiplicate ratio of this radius, by Cor. 6, Prop. IV. If that force
of the central body should gradually decay, the body P being less and
less attracted would go farther and farther from the centre T; and,
on the contrary, if it were increased, it would draw nearer to it.
Therefore if the action of the distant body S, by which that force is
diminished, were to increase and decrease by turns, the radius TP will
be also increased and diminished by turns; and the periodical time will
be increased and diminished in a ratio compounded of the sesquiplicate
ratio of the radius, and of the subduplicate of that ratio in which the
centripetal force of the central body T is diminished or increased, by
the increase or decrease of the action of the distant body S.</p>

<p>COR. 7. It also follows, from what was before laid down, that the axis
of the ellipsis described by the body P, or the line of the apsides,
does as to its angular motion go forwards and backwards by turns, but
more forwards than backwards, and by the excess of its direct motion is
in the whole carried forwards. For the force with which the body P is
urged to the body T at the quadratures, where the force MN vanishes,
is compounded of the force LM and the centripetal force with which
the body T attracts the body P. The first force LM, if the distance
PT be increased, is increased in nearly the same proportion with that
distance, and the other force decreases in the duplicate ratio of the
distance; and therefore the sum of these two forces decreases in a less
than the duplicate ratio of the distance PT; and therefore, by Cor. 1,
Prop. XLV, will make the line of the apsides, or, which is the same
thing, the upper apsis, to go backward. But at the conjunction and
opposition the force with which the body P is urged towards the body
T is the difference of the force KL, and of the force with which the
body T attracts the body P; and that difference, because the force KL
is very nearly increased in the ratio of the distance PT, decreases in
more than the duplicate ratio of the distance PT; and therefore, by
Cor. 1, Prop. XLV, causes the line of the apsides to go forwards. In
the places between the syzygies and the quadratures, the motion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span> of the
line of the apsides depends upon both of these causes conjunctly, so
that it either goes forwards or backwards in proportion to the excess
of one of these causes above the other. Therefore since the force
KL in the syzygies is almost twice as great as the force LM in the
quadratures, the excess will be on the side of the force KL, and by
consequence the line of the apsides will be carried forwards.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width500" style="width: 500px;" id="i_207">
<img alt="The ellipse axis of body P shifts back and forth but moves forward overall due to a greater forward angular motion." height="151" src="images/i_207.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i_207.jpg">
</figure>

<p class="nind">
The truth of this and the foregoing Corollary will be more easily
understood by conceiving the system of the two bodies T and P to be
surrounded on every side by several bodies S, S, S, &amp;c., disposed about
the orbit ESE. For by the actions of these bodies the action of the
body T will be diminished on every side, and decrease in more than a
duplicate ratio of the distance.</p>

<p>COR. 8. But since the progress or regress of the apsides depends upon
the decrease of the centripetal force, that is, upon its being in a
greater or less ratio than the duplicate ratio of the distance TP, in
the passage of the body from the lower apsis to the upper; and upon a
like increase in its return to the lower apsis again; and therefore
becomes greatest where the proportion of the force at the upper apsis
to the force at the lower apsis recedes farthest from the duplicate
ratio of the distances inversely; it is plain, that, when the apsides
are in the syzygies, they will, by reason of the subducting force KL
or NM - LM, go forward more swiftly; and in the quadratures by the
additional force LM go backward more slowly. Because the velocity of
the progress or slowness of the regress is continued for a long time;
this inequality becomes exceedingly great.</p>

<p>COR. 9. If a body is obliged, by a force reciprocally proportional to
the square of its distance from any centre, to revolve in an ellipsis
round that centre; and afterwards in its descent from the upper apsis
to the lower apsis, that force by a perpetual accession of new force is
increased in more than a duplicate ratio of the diminished distance; it
is manifest that the body, being impelled always towards the centre by
the perpetual accession of this new force, will incline more towards
that centre than if it were urged by that force alone which decreases
in a duplicate ratio of the diminished distance, and therefore will
describe an orbit interior to that elliptical orbit, and at the lower
apsis approaching nearer to the centre than before. Therefore the orbit
by the accession of this new force will become more eccentrical. If
now, while the body is returning from the lower to the upper apsis, it
should decrease by the same degrees by which it increases before the
body would return to its first distance: and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span> if the force
decreases in a yet greater ratio, the body, being now less attracted
than before, will ascend to a still greater distance, and so the
eccentricity of the orbit will be increased still more. Therefore if
the ratio of the increase and decrease of the centripetal force be
augmented each revolution, the eccentricity will be augmented also;
and, on the contrary, if that ratio decrease, it will be diminished.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, in the system of the bodies T, P, S, when the apsides
of the orbit PAB are in the quadratures, the ratio of that increase
and decrease is least of all, and becomes greatest when the apsides
are in the syzygies. If the apsides are placed in the quadratures, the
ratio near the apsides is less, and near the syzygies greater, than the
duplicate ratio of the distances; and from that greater ratio arises a
direct motion of the line of the apsides, as was just now said. But if
we consider the ratio of the whole increase or decrease in the progress
between the apsides, this is less than the duplicate ratio of the
distances. The force in the lower is to the force in the upper apsis in
less than a duplicate ratio of the distance of the upper apsis from the
focus of the ellipsis to the distance of the lower apsis from the same
focus; and, contrariwise, when the apsides are placed in the syzygies,
the force in the lower apsis is to the force in the upper apsis in a
greater than a duplicate ratio of the distances. For the forces LM in
the quadratures added to the forces of the body T compose forces in a
less ratio; and the forces KL in the syzygies subducted from the forces
of the body T, leave the forces in a greater ratio. Therefore the ratio
of the whole increase and decrease in the passage between the apsides
is least at the quadratures and greatest at the syzygies; and therefore
in the passage of the apsides from the quadratures to the syzygies
it is continually augmented, and increases the eccentricity of the
ellipsis; and in the passage from the syzygies to the quadratures it is
perpetually decreasing, and diminishes the eccentricity.</p>

<p>COR. 10. That we may give an account of the errors as to latitude,
let us suppose the plane of the orbit EST to remain immovable; and
from the cause of the errors above explained, it is manifest, that,
of the two forces NM, ML, which are the only and entire cause of
them, the force ML acting always in the plane of the orbit PAB never
disturbs the motions as to latitude; and that the force NM, when
the nodes are in the syzygies, acting also in the same plane of the
orbit, does not at that time affect those motions. But when the nodes
are in the quadratures, it disturbs them very much, and, attracting
the body P perpetually out of the plane of its orbit, it diminishes
the inclination of the plane in the passage of the body from the
quadratures to the syzygies, and again increases the same in the
passage from the syzygies to the quadratures. Hence it comes to pass
that when the body is in the syzygies, the inclination is then least of
all, and returns to the first magnitude nearly, when the body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span> arrives
at the next node.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width500" style="width: 500px;" id="i_209">
<img alt="At syzygies, the inclination is minimal and nearly returns to its original value when the body reaches the next node." height="144" src="images/i_209.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i_209.jpg">
</figure>

<p class="nind">
But if the nodes are situate at the octants after the quadratures,
that is, between C and A, D and B, it will appear, from what was
just now shewn, that in the passage of the body P from either node
to the ninetieth degree from thence, the inclination of the plane
is perpetually diminished; then, in the passage through the next
45 degrees to the next quadrature, the inclination is increased;
and afterwards, again, in its passage through another 45 degrees
to the next node, it is diminished. Therefore the inclination is
more diminished than increased, and is therefore always less in the
subsequent node than in the preceding one. And, by a like reasoning,
the inclination is more increased than diminished when the nodes
are in the other octants between A and D, B and C. The inclination,
therefore, is the greatest of all when the nodes are in the syzygies
In their passage from the syzygies to the quadratures the inclination
is diminished at each appulse of the body to the nodes; and becomes
least of all when the nodes are in the quadratures, and the body in the
syzygies; then it increases by the same degrees by which it decreased
before; and, when the nodes come to the next syzygies, returns to its
former magnitude.</p>

<p>COR. 11. Because when the nodes are in the quadratures the body P is
perpetually attracted from the plane of its orbit; and because this
attraction is made towards S in its passage from the node C through the
conjunction A to the node D; and to the contrary part in its passage
from the node D through the opposition B to the node C; it is manifest
that, in its motion from the node C, the body recedes continually from
the former plane CD of its orbit till it comes to the next node; and
therefore at that node, being now at its greatest distance from the
first plane CD, it will pass through the plane of the orbit EST not
in D, the other node of that plane, but in a point that lies nearer
to the body S, which therefore becomes a new place of the node <i>in
antecedentia</i> to its former place. And, by a like reasoning, the
nodes will continue to recede in their passage from this node to the
next. The nodes, therefore, when situate in the quadratures, recede
perpetually; and at the syzygies, where no perturbation can be produced
in the motion as to latitude, are quiescent: in the intermediate
places they partake of both conditions, and recede more slowly; and,
therefore, being always either retrograde or stationary, they will be
carried backwards, or <i>in antecedentia</i>, each revolution.</p>

<p>COR. 12. All the errors described in these corollaries are a little
greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span> at the conjunction of the bodies P, S, than at their
opposition; because the generating forces NM and ML are greater.</p>

<p>COR. 13. And since the causes and proportions of the errors and
variations mentioned in these Corollaries do not depend upon the
magnitude of the body S, it follows that all things before demonstrated
will happen, if the magnitude of the body S be imagined so great as
that the system of the two bodies P and T may revolve about it. And
from this increase of the body S, and the consequent increase of its
centripetal force, from which the errors of the body P arise, it will
follow that all these errors, at equal distances, will be greater in
this case, than in the other where the body S revolves about the system
of the bodies P and T.</p>

<p>COR. 14. But since the forces NM, ML, when the body S is exceedingly
distant, are very nearly as the force SK and the ratio PT to ST
conjunctly; that is, if both the distance PT, and the absolute force
of the body S be given, as ST<sup>3</sup> reciprocally; and since those forces
NM, ML are the causes of all the errors and effects treated of in the
foregoing Corollaries; it is manifest that all those effects, if the
system of bodies T and P continue as before, and only the distance ST
and the absolute force of the body S be changed, will be very nearly
in a ratio compounded of the direct ratio of the absolute force of the
body S, and the triplicate inverse ratio of the distance ST. Hence if
the system of bodies T and P revolve about a distant body S, those
forces NM, ML, and their effects, will be (by Cor. 2 and 6, Prop. IV)
reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the periodical time. And thence,
also, if the magnitude of the body S be proportional to its absolute
force, those forces NM, ML, and their effects, will be directly as the
cube of the apparent diameter of the distant body S viewed from T, and
so <i>vice versa</i>. For these ratios are the same as the compounded
ratio above mentioned.</p>

<p>COR. 15. And because if the orbits ESE and PAB, retaining their
figure, proportions, and inclination to each other, should alter their
magnitude; and the forces of the bodies S and T should either remain,
or be changed in any given ratio; these forces (that is, the force of
the body T, which obliges the body P to deflect from a rectilinear
course into the orbit PAB, and the force of the body S, which causes
the body P to deviate from that orbit) would act always in the same
manner, and in the same proportion; it follows, that all the effects
will be similar and proportional, and the times of those effects
proportional also; that is, that all the linear errors will be as the
diameters of the orbits, the angular errors the same as before; and
the times of similar linear errors, or equal angular errors, as the
periodical times of the orbits.</p>

<p>COR. 16. Therefore if the figures of the orbits and their inclination
to each other be given, and the magnitudes, forces, and distances of
the bodies be any how changed, we may, from the errors and times of
those errors in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span> one case, collect very nearly the errors and times of
the errors in any other case. But this may be done more expeditiously
by the following method. The forces NM, ML, other things remaining
unaltered, are as the radius TP; and their periodical effects (by Cor.
2, Lem. X) are as the forces and the square of the periodical time of
the body P conjunctly. These are the linear errors of the body P; and
hence the angular errors as they appear from the centre T (that is, the
motion of the apsides and of the nodes, and all the apparent errors as
to longitude and latitude) are in each revolution of the body P as the
square of the time of the revolution, very nearly. Let these ratios be
compounded with the ratios in Cor. 14, and in any system of bodies T,
P, S, where P revolves about T very near to it, and T revolves about S
at a great distance, the angular errors of the body P, observed from
the centre T, will be in each revolution of the body P as the square
of the periodical time of the body P directly, and the square of the
periodical time of the body T inversely. And therefore the mean motion
of the line of the apsides will be in a given ratio to the mean motion
of the nodes; and both those motions will be as the periodical time
of the body P directly, and the square of the periodical time of the
body T inversely. The increase or diminution of the eccentricity and
inclination of the orbit PAB makes no sensible variation in the motions
of the apsides and nodes, unless that increase or diminution be very
great indeed.</p>

</figure>

<p>COR. 17. Since the line LM becomes sometimes greater and sometimes less
than the radius PT, let the mean quantity of the force LM be expressed
by that radius PT; and then that mean force will be to the mean force
SK or SN (which may be also expressed by ST) as the length PT to the
length ST. But the mean force SN or ST, by which the body T is retained
in the orbit it describes about S, is to the force with which the body
P is retained in its orbit about T in a ratio compounded of the ratio
of the radius ST to the radius PT, and the duplicate ratio of the
periodical time of the body P about T to the periodical time of the
body T about S. And, <i>ex æquo</i>, the mean force LM is to the force
by which the body P is retained in its orbit about T (or by which the
same body P might revolve at the distance PT in the same periodical
time about any immovable point T) in the same duplicate ratio of the
periodical times. The periodical times therefore being given, together
with the distance PT, the mean force LM is also given; and that force
being given, there is given also the force MN, very nearly, by the
analogy of the lines PT and MN.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>COR. 18. By the same laws by which the body P revolves about the body
T, let us suppose many fluid bodies to move round T at equal distances
from it; and to be so numerous, that they may all become contiguous
to each other, so as to form a fluid annulus, or ring, of a round
figure, and concentrical to the body T; and the several parts of this
annulus, performing their motions by the same law as the body P, will
draw nearer to the body T, and move swifter in the conjunction and
opposition of themselves and the body S, than in the quadratures. And
the nodes of this annulus, or its intersections with the plane of the
orbit of the body S or T, will rest at the syzygies; but out of the
syzygies they will be carried backward, or <i>in antecedentia</i>; with
the greatest swiftness in the quadratures, and more slowly in other
places. The inclination of this annulus also will vary, and its axis
will oscillate each revolution, and when the revolution is completed
will return to its former situation, except only that it will be
carried round a little by the præcession of the nodes.</p>

<p>COR. 19. Suppose now the sphærical body T, consisting of some matter
not fluid, to be enlarged, and to extend itself on every side as far as
that annulus, and that a channel were cut all round its circumference
containing water; and that this sphere revolves uniformly about its
own axis in the same periodical time. This water being accelerated and
retarded by turns (as in the last Corollary), will be swifter at the
syzygies, and slower at the quadratures, than the surface of the globe,
and so will ebb and flow in its channel after the manner of the sea. If
the attraction of the body S were taken away, the water would acquire
no motion of flux and reflux by revolving round the quiescent centre of
the globe. The case is the same of a globe moving uniformly forwards
in a right line, and in the mean time revolving about its centre (by
Cor. 5 of the Laws of Motion), and of a globe uniformly attracted from
its rectilinear course (by Cor. 6, of the same Laws). But let the body
S come to act upon it, and by its unequable attraction the water will
receive this new motion; for there will be a stronger attraction upon
that part of the water that is nearest to the body, and a weaker upon
that part which is more remote. And the force LM will attract the water
downwards at the quadratures, and depress it as far as the syzygies;
and the force KL will attract it upwards in the syzygies, and withhold
its descent, and make it rise as far as the quadratures; except only in
so far as the motion of flux and reflux may be directed by the channel
of the water, and be a little retarded by friction.</p>

<p>COR. 20. If, now, the annulus becomes hard, and the globe is
diminished, the motion of flux and reflux will cease; but the
oscillating motion of the inclination and the præcession of the nodes
will remain. Let the globe have the same axis with the annulus, and
perform its revolutions in the same times, and at its surface touch
the annulus within, and adhere to it; then the globe partaking of the
motion of the annulus, this whole compages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span> will oscillate, and the
nodes will go backward, for the globe, as we shall shew presently, is
perfectly indifferent to the receiving of all impressions. The greatest
angle of the inclination of the annulus single is when the nodes are in
the syzygies. Thence in the progress of the nodes to the quadratures,
it endeavours to diminish its inclination, and by that endeavour
impresses a motion upon the whole globe. The globe retains this motion
impressed, till the annulus by a contrary endeavour destroys that
motion, and impresses a new motion in a contrary direction.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width500" style="width: 500px;" id="i_213">
<img alt="If the annulus becomes hard, and the globe is diminished, the motion of flux and reflux will cease." height="148" src="images/i_213.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i_213.jpg">
</figure>

<p class="nind">
And by this means the greatest motion of the decreasing inclination
happens when the nodes are in the quadratures, and the least angle
of inclination in the octants after the quadratures; and, again,
the greatest motion of reclination happens when the nodes are in
the syzygies; and the greatest angle of reclination in the octants
following. And the case is the same of a globe without this annulus,
if it be a little higher or a little denser in the equatorial than in
the polar regions; for the excess of that matter in the regions near
the equator supplies the place of the annulus. And though we should
suppose the centripetal force of this globe to be any how increased, so
that all its parts were to tend downwards, as the parts of our earth
gravitate to the centre, yet the phænomena of this and the preceding
Corollary would scarce be altered; except that the places of the
greatest and least height of the water will be different; for the water
is now no longer sustained and kept in its orbit by its centrifugal
force, but by the channel in which it flows. And, besides, the force
LM attracts the water downwards most in the quadratures, and the force
KL or NM - LM attracts it upwards most in the syzygies. And these
forces conjoined cease to attract the water downwards, and begin to
attract it upwards in the octants before the syzygies; and cease to
attract the water upwards, and begin to attract the water downwards in
the octants after the syzygies. And thence the greatest height of the
water may happen about the octants after the syzygies; and the least
height about the octants after the quadratures; excepting only so far
as the motion of ascent or descent impressed by these forces may by the
<i>vis insita</i> of the water continue a little longer, or be stopped
a little sooner by impediments in its channel.</p>

<p>COR. 21. For the same reason that redundant matter in the equatorial
regions of a globe causes the nodes to go backwards, and therefore by
the increase of that matter that retrogradation is increased, by the
diminution is diminished, and by the removal quite ceases: it follows,
that, if more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span> that redundant matter be taken away, that is, if
the globe be either more depressed, or of a more rare consistence near
the equator than near the poles, there will arise a motion of the nodes
<i>in consequentia</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 22. And thence from the motion of the nodes is known
the constitution of the globe. That is, if the globe retains
unalterably the same poles, and the motion (of the nodes) be <i>in
antecedentia</i>, there is a redundance of the matter near the equator;
but if <i>in consequentia</i>, a deficiency. Suppose a uniform and
exactly sphærical globe to be first at rest in a free space; then by
some impulse made obliquely upon its superficies to be driven from
its place, and to receive a motion partly circular and partly right
forward. Because this globe is perfectly indifferent to all the axes
that pass through its centre, nor has a greater propensity to one axis
or to one situation of the axis than to any other, it is manifest that
by its own force it will never change its axis, or the inclination
of it. Let now this globe be impelled obliquely by a new impulse in
the same part of its superficies as before, and since the effect of
an impulse is not at all changed by its coming sooner or later, it is
manifest that these two impulses, successively impressed, will produce
the same motion as if they were impressed at the same time; that is,
the same motion as if the globe had been impelled by a simple force
compounded of them both (by Cor. 2, of the Laws), that is, a simple
motion about an axis of a given inclination. And the case is the same
if the second impulse were made upon any other place of the equator
of the first motion; and also if the first impulse were made upon any
place in the equator of the motion which would be generated by the
second impulse alone; and therefore, also, when both impulses are made
in any places whatsoever; for these impulses will generate the same
circular motion as if they were impressed together, and at once, in
the place of the intersections of the equators of those motions, which
would be generated by each of them separately. Therefore, a homogeneous
and perfect globe will not retain several distinct motions, but will
unite all those that are impressed on it, and reduce them into one;
revolving, as far as in it lies, always with a simple and uniform
motion about one single given axis, with an inclination perpetually
invariable. And the inclination of the axis, or the velocity of the
rotation, will not be changed by centripetal force. For if the globe be
supposed to be divided into two hemispheres, by any plane whatsoever
passing through its own centre, and the centre to which the force is
directed, that force will always urge each hemisphere equally; and
therefore will not incline the globe any way as to its motion round
its own axis. But let there be added any where between the pole and
the equator a heap of new matter like a mountain, and this, by its
perpetual endeavour to recede from the centre of its motion, will
disturb the motion of the globe, and cause its poles to wander about
its superficies, describing circles about themselves and their opposite
points. Neither can this enormous evagation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span> of the poles be corrected,
unless by placing that mountain either in one of the poles; in which
case, by Cor. 21, the nodes of the equator will go forwards; or in
the equatorial regions, in which case, by Cor. 20, the nodes will
go backwards; or, lastly, by adding on the other side of the axis a
new quantity of matter, by which the mountain may be balanced in its
motion; and then the nodes will either go forwards or backwards, as the
mountain and this newly added matter happen to be nearer to the pole or
to the equator.</p>

<p>For the attractions of the body S towards T and P compose its absolute

gravity of the bodies T and P, than it is to the greatest body T; and
which is more in a reciprocal proportion to the square of the distance

by a little consideration.</p>

well as the rest, than it would do if that body were either at rest as
not attracted, or were much more or much less attracted, or much more
or much less agitated.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This may be demonstrated after the same manner as Prop. LXVI, but
by a more prolix reasoning, which I therefore pass over. It will be
sufficient to consider it after this manner. From the demonstration
of the last Proposition it is plain, that the centre, towards which
the body S is urged by the two forces conjunctly, is very near to the
common centre of gravity of those two other bodies. If this centre were
to coincide with that common centre, and moreover the common centre
of gravity of all the three bodies were at rest, the body S on one
side, and the common centre of gravity of the other two bodies on the
other side, would describe true ellipses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span> about that quiescent common
centre. This appears from Cor. 2, Prop. LVIII, compared with what was
demonstrated in Prop. LXIV, and LXV.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_216">

</figure>

<p class="nind">
Now this accurate elliptical motion will be disturbed a little by
the distance of the centre of the two bodies from the centre towards
which the third body S is attracted. Let there be added, moreover, a
motion to the common centre of the three, and the perturbation will be
increased yet more. Therefore the perturbation is least when the common
centre of the three bodies is at rest; that is, when the innermost and
greatest body T is attracted according to the same law as the rest are;
and is always greatest when the common centre of the three, by the
diminution of the motion of the body T, begins to be moved, and is more
and more agitated.</p>

<p>COR. And hence if more lesser bodies revolve about the great one,
it may easily be inferred that the orbits described will approach
nearer to ellipses; and the descriptions of areas will be more nearly
equable, if all the bodies mutually attract and agitate each other with
accelerative forces that are as their absolute forces directly, and
the squares of the distances inversely: and if the focus of each orbit
be placed in the common centre of gravity of all the interior bodies
(that is, if the focus of the first and innermost orbit be placed in
the centre of gravity of the greatest and innermost body; the focus of
the second orbit in the common centre of gravity of the two innermost
bodies; the focus of the third orbit in the common centre of gravity
of the three innermost; and so on), than if the innermost body were at
rest, and was made the common focus of all the orbits.</p>

<p>For the accelerative attractions of all the bodies B, C, D, towards
A, are by the supposition equal to each other at equal distances; and
in like manner the accelerative attractions of all the bodies towards
B are also equal to each other at equal distances. But the absolute
attractive force of the body A is to the absolute attractive force of
the body B as the accelerative attraction of all the bodies towards A
to the accelerative attraction of all the bodies towards B at equal
distances; and so is also the accelerative attraction of the body B
towards A to the accelerative attraction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span> of the body A towards B.
But the accelerative attraction of the body B towards A is to the
accelerative attraction of the body A towards B as the mass of the body
A to the mass of the body B; because the motive forces which (by the
2d, 7th, and 8th Definition) are as the accelerative forces and the
bodies attracted conjunctly are here equal to one another by the third
Law. Therefore the absolute attractive force of the body A is to the
absolute attractive force of the body B as the mass of the body A to
the mass of the body B. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore if each of the bodies of the system A, B, C, D, &amp;c.
does singly attract all the rest with accelerative forces that are
reciprocally as the squares of the distances from the attracting body,
the absolute forces of all those bodies will be to each other as the
bodies themselves.</p>

<p>COR. 2. By a like reasoning, if each of the bodies of the system A, B,
C, D, &amp;c., do singly attract all the rest with accelerative forces,
which are either reciprocally or directly in the ratio of any power
whatever of the distances from the attracting body; or which are
defined by the distances from each of the attracting bodies according
to any common law; it is plain that the absolute forces of those bodies
are as the bodies themselves.</p>

to that great body describe areas proportional to the times exactly;
the absolute forces of those bodies to each other will be either
accurately or very nearly in the ratio of the bodies. And so on the
contrary. This appears from Cor. of Prop. XLVIII, compared with the
first Corollary of this Prop.</p>

<p>These Propositions naturally lead us to the analogy there is between
centripetal forces, and the central bodies to which those forces used
to be directed; for it is reasonable to suppose that forces which
are directed to bodies should depend upon the nature and quantity of
those bodies, as we see they do in magnetical experiments. And when
such cases occur, we are to compute the attractions of the bodies
by assigning to each of their particles its proper force, and then
collecting the sum of them all. I here use the word attraction in
general for any endeavour, of what kind soever, made by bodies to
approach to each other; whether that endeavour arise from the action
of the bodies themselves, as tending mutually to or agitating each
other by spirits emitted; or whether it arises from the action of the
æther or of the air, or of any medium whatsoever, whether corporeal
or incorporeal, any how impelling bodies placed therein towards each
other. In the same general sense I use the word impulse, not defining
in this treatise the species or physical qualities of forces, but
investigating the quantities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span> and mathematical proportions of them;
as I observed before in the Definitions. In mathematics we are to
investigate the quantities of forces with their proportions consequent
upon any conditions supposed; then, when we enter upon physics, we
compare those proportions with the phænomena of Nature, that we may
know what conditions of those forces answer to the several kinds of
attractive bodies. And this preparation being made, we argue more
safely concerning the physical species, causes, and proportions of the
forces. Let us see, then, with what forces sphærical bodies consisting
of particles endued with attractive powers in the manner above spoken
of must act mutually upon one another; and what kind of motions will
follow from thence.</p>

the sphærical superficies, terminated by right lines passing through
P, will be in the duplicate ratio of those distances. Therefore the
forces of these particles exerted upon the body P are equal between
themselves. For the forces are as the particles directly, and the
squares of the distances inversely. And these two ratios compose the
ratio of equality. The attractions therefore, being made equally

PHK, PIL, <i>phk</i>, <i>pil</i>, cutting off from the great circles
AHB, <i>ahb</i>, the equal arcs HK, <i>hk</i>, IL, <i>il</i>; and to
those lines let fall the perpendiculars SD, <i>sd</i>, SE, <i>se</i>,

DS and <i>ds</i>, ES and <i>es</i> are equal, the lines PE, PF, and
<i>pe</i>, <i>pf</i>, and the lineolæ DF, <i>df</i> may be taken for
equal; because their last ratio, when the angles DPE, <i>dpe</i> vanish
together, is the ratio of equality. These things then supposed, it
will be, as PI to PF so is RI to DF, and as <i>pf</i> to <i>pi</i>

several particles of the attracted sphere with the same force with
which they are attracted by it. But that attraction of the corpuscle

<p>Imagine several concentric similar spheres, AB, CD, EF, &amp;c.; the
innermost of which added to the outermost may compose a matter more
dense towards the centre, or subducted from them may leave the same
more lax and rare. Then, by Prop. LXXV, these spheres will attract
other similar concentric<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span> spheres GH, IK, LM, &amp;c., each the other,
with forces reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance
SP. And, by composition or division, the sum of all those forces, or
the excess of any of them above the others; that is, the entire force
with which the whole sphere AB (composed of any concentric spheres or
of their differences) will attract the whole sphere GH (composed of
any concentric spheres or their differences) in the same ratio. Let
the number of the concentric spheres be increased <i>in infinitum</i>,
so that the density of the matter together with the attractive force
may, in the progress from the circumference to the centre, increase or
decrease according to any given law; and by the addition of matter not
attractive, let the deficient density be supplied, that so the spheres
may acquire any form desired; and the force with which one of these
attracts the other will be still, by the former reasoning, in the same
ratio of the square of the distance inversely. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if many spheres of this kind, similar in all respects,
attract each other mutually, the accelerative attractions of each to
each, at any equal distances of the centres, will be as the attracting
spheres.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And at any unequal distances, as the attracting spheres applied
to the squares of the distances between the centres.</p>

<p>COR. 3. The motive attractions, or the weights of the spheres towards
one another, will be at equal distances of the centres as the
attracting and attracted spheres conjunctly; that is, as the products
arising from multiplying the spheres into each other.</p>

<p>COR. 4. And at unequal distances, as those products directly, and the
squares of the distances between the centres inversely.</p>

<p>COR. 5. These proportions take place also when the attraction arises
from the attractive virtue of both spheres mutually exerted upon each
other. For the attraction is only doubled by the conjunction of the
forces, the proportions remaining as before.</p>

<p>COR. 6. If spheres of this kind revolve about others at rest, each
about each; and the distances between the centres of the quiescent and
revolving bodies are proportional to the diameters of the quiescent
bodies; the periodic times will be equal.</p>

<p>COR. 7. And, again, if the periodic times are equal, the distances will
be proportional to the diameters.</p>

<p>COR. 8. All those truths above demonstrated, relating to the motions
of bodies about the foci of conic sections, will take place when an
attracting sphere, of any form and condition like that above described,
is placed in the focus.</p>

<p>CASE 1. Let AEBF be a sphere; S its centre.; P a corpuscle
attracted; PASB the axis of the sphere passing through the centre
of the corpuscle; EF, <i>ef</i> two planes cutting the sphere, and
perpendicular to the axis, and equi-distant, one on one side, the
other on the other, from the centre of the sphere; G and <i>g</i> the
intersections of the planes and the axis; and H any point in the plane
EF. The centripetal force of the point H upon the corpuscle P, exerted
in the direction of the line PH, is as the distance PH; and (by Cor.
2, of the Laws) the same exerted in the direction of the line PG, or
towards the centre S, is as the length PG. Therefore the force of all
the points in the plane EF (that is, of that whole plane) by which
the corpuscle P is attracted towards the centre S is as the distance
PG multiplied by the number of those points, that is, as the solid
contained under that plane EF and the distance PG. And in like manner
the force of the plane <i>ef</i>, by which the corpuscle P is attracted
towards the centre S, is as that plane drawn into its distance
P<i>g</i>, or as the equal plane EF drawn into that distance P<i>g</i>;
and the sum of the forces of both planes as the plane EF drawn into
the sum of the distances PG + P<i>g</i>, that is, as that plane drawn
into twice the distance PS of the centre and the corpuscle; that is,
as twice the plane EF drawn into the distance PS, or as the sum of
the equal planes EF + <i>ef</i> drawn into the same distance. And, by
a like reasoning, the forces of all the planes in the whole sphere,
equi-distant on each side from the centre of the sphere, are as the
sum of those planes drawn into the distance PS, that is, as the whole
sphere and the distance PS conjunctly. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 2. Let now the corpuscle P attract the sphere AEBF. And, by the
same reasoning, it will appear that the force with which the sphere is
attracted is as the distance PS. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 3. Imagine another sphere composed of innumerable corpuscles P;
and because the force with which every corpuscle is attracted is as
the distance of the corpuscle from the centre of the first sphere, and
as the same sphere conjunctly, and is therefore the same as if it all
proceeded from a single corpuscle situate in the centre of the sphere,
the entire force with which all the corpuscles in the second sphere are
attracted, that is, with which that whole sphere is attracted, will be
the same as if that sphere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span> were attracted by a force issuing from a
single corpuscle in the centre of the first sphere; and is therefore
proportional to the distance between the centres of the spheres. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 4. Let the spheres attract each other mutually, and the force will
be doubled, but the proportion will remain. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 5. Let the corpuscle <i>p</i> be placed within the sphere AEBF;
and because the force of the plane <i>ef</i> upon the corpuscle is as
the solid contained under that plane and the distance <i>pg</i>; and
the contrary force of the plane EF as the solid contained under that
plane and the distance <i>p</i>G; the force compounded of both will
be as the difference of the solids, that is, as the sum of the equal
planes drawn into half the difference of the distances; that is, as
that sum drawn into <i>p</i>S, the distance of the corpuscle from the
centre of the sphere. And, by a like reasoning, the attraction of all
the planes EF, <i>ef</i>, throughout the whole sphere, that is, the
attraction of the whole sphere, is conjunctly as the sum of all the
planes, or as the whole sphere, and as <i>p</i>S, the distance of the
corpuscle from the centre of the sphere. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 6. And if there be composed a new sphere out of innumerable
corpuscles such as <i>p</i>, situate within the first sphere AEBF, it
may be proved, as before, that the attraction, whether single of one
sphere towards the other, or mutual of both towards each other, will be

<p>I have now explained the two principal cases of attractions; to wit,
when the centripetal forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the
distances, or increase in a simple ratio of the distances, causing
the bodies in both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span> cases to revolve in conic sections, and composing
sphærical bodies whose centripetal forces observe the same law of
increase or decrease in the recess from the centre as the forces of the
particles themselves do; which is very remarkable. It would be tedious
to run over the other cases, whose conclusions are less elegant and
important, so particularly as I have done these. I choose rather to
comprehend and determine them all by one general method as follows.</p>

</figure>

<p>As if the centripetal forces of the particles of the sphere be
reciprocally as the distances of the corpuscle attracted by them; the
force with which the corpuscle situate in I is attracted by the entire
sphere will be to the force with which it is attracted in P in a ratio
compounded of the subduplicate ratio of the distance SI to the distance
SP, and the subduplicate ratio of the centripetal force in the place I
arising from any particle in the centre to the centripetal force in the
place P arising from the same particle in the centre; that is, in the
subduplicate ratio of the distances SI, SP to each other reciprocally.
These two subduplicate ratios compose the ratio of equality, and
therefore the attractions in I and P produced by the whole sphere are
equal. By the like calculation, if the forces of the particles of
the sphere are reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of the distances,
it will be found that the attraction in I is to the attraction in P
as the distance SP to the semi-diameter SA of the sphere. If those
forces are reciprocally in a triplicate ratio of the distances, the
attractions in I and P will be to each other as SP<sup>2</sup> to SA<sup>2</sup>; if in a
quadruplicate ratio, as SP<sup>3</sup> to SA<sup>3</sup>. Therefore since the attraction
in P was found in this last case to be reciprocally as PS<sup>3</sup> × PI, the
attraction in I will be reciprocally as SA<sup>3</sup> × PI, that is, because
SA<sup>3</sup> is given reciprocally as PI. And the progression is the same <i>in
infinitum</i>. The demonstration of this Theorem is as follows:</p>

<i>Of the attractive forces of bodies which are not of a sphærical
figure.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION LXXXV. THEOREM XLII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If a body be attracted by another, and its attraction be vastly
stronger when it is contiguous to the attracting body than when they
are separated from one another by a very small interval; the forces of
the particles of the attracting body decrease, in the recess of the
body attracted, in more than a duplicate ratio of the distance of the
particles.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For if the forces decrease in a duplicate ratio of the distances from
the particles, the attraction towards a sphærical body being (by Prop.
LXXIV) reciprocally as the square of the distance of the attracted
body from the centre of the sphere, will not be sensibly increased
by the contact, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span> will be still less increased by it, if the
attraction, in the recess of the body attracted, decreases in a still
less proportion. The proposition, therefore, is evident concerning
attractive spheres. And the case is the same of concave sphærical
orbs attracting external bodies. And much more does it appear in orbs
that attract bodies placed within them, because there the attractions
diffused through the cavities of those orbs are (by Prop. LXX)
destroyed by contrary attractions, and therefore have no effect even in
the place of contact. Now if from these spheres and sphærical orbs we
take away any parts remote from the place of contact, and add new parts
any where at pleasure, we may change the figures of the attractive
bodies at pleasure; but the parts added or taken away, being remote
from the place of contact, will cause no remarkable excess of the
attraction arising from the contact of the two bodies. Therefore the
proposition holds good in bodies of all figures. Q.E.D.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION LXXXVI. THEOREM XLIII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If the forces of the particles of which an attractive body is
composed decrease, in the recess of the attractive body, in a
triplicate or more than a triplicate ratio of the distance from the
particles, the attraction will be vastly stronger in the point of
contact than when the attracting and attracted bodies are separated
from each other, though by never so small an interval.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For that the attraction is infinitely increased when the attracted
corpuscle comes to touch an attracting sphere of this kind, appears,
by the solution of Problem XLI, exhibited in the second and third
Examples. The same will also appear (by comparing those Examples
and Theorem XLI together) of attractions of bodies made towards
concavo-convex orbs, whether the attracted bodies be placed without
the orbs, or in the cavities within them. And by adding to or taking
from those spheres and orbs any attractive matter any where without
the place of contact, so that the attractive bodies may receive
any assigned figure, the Proposition will hold good of all bodies
universally. Q.E.D.</p>

bodies proportional to the wholes, and alike situated in them.</i></p>

<p>For if the bodies are divided into particles proportional to the

<p>COR. 1. Therefore if, as the distances of the corpuscles attracted
increase, the attractive forces of the particles decrease in the ratio
of any power of the distances, the accelerative attractions towards
the whole bodies will be as the bodies directly, and those powers of
the distances inversely. As if the forces of the particles decrease
in a duplicate ratio of the distances from the corpuscles attracted,
and the bodies are as A<sup>3</sup> and B<sup>3</sup>, and therefore both the cubic
sides of the bodies, and the distance of the attracted corpuscles
from the bodies, are as A and B; the accelerative attractions

bodies attract corpuscles similarly situated, may be collected the

may so speak) as those particles drawn into their distances AZ, BZ

Cor. 2, of the Laws) be resolved into the forces A × GZ and A × AG; and
the force B × BZ into the forces B × GZ and B × BG. Now the forces A ×
AG and B × BG, because A is proportional to B, and BG to AG, are equal,
and therefore having contrary directions destroy one another. There
remain then the forces A × GZ and B × GZ. These tend from Z towards the

spheroid, S its centre, and P the body attracted. Through the body
P let there be drawn the semi-diameter SPA, and two right lines DE,
FG meeting the spheroid in D and E, F and G; and let PCM, HLN be the
superficies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span> two interior spheroids similar and concentrical to the
exterior, the first of which passes through the body P, and cuts the
right lines DE, FG in B and C; and the latter cuts the same right lines
in H and I, K and L. Let the spheroids have all one common axis, and
the parts of the right lines intercepted on both sides DP and BE, FP
and CG, DH and IE, FK and LG, will be mutually equal; because the right
lines DE, PB, and HI, are bisected in the same point, as are also the
right lines FG, PC, and KL. Conceive now DPF, EPG to represent opposite
cones described with the infinitely small vertical angles DPF, EPG,
and the lines DH, EI to be infinitely small also. Then the particles
of the cones DHKF, GLIE, cut off by the spheroidical superficies, by
reason of the equality of the lines DH and EI, will be to one another
as the squares of the distances from the body P, and will therefore
attract that corpuscle equally. And by a like reasoning if the spaces
DPF, EGCB be divided into particles by the superficies of innumerable
similar spheroids concentric to the former and having one common axis,
all these particles will equally attract on both sides the body P
towards contrary parts. Therefore the forces of the cone DPF, and of
the conic segment EGCB, are equal, and by their contrariety destroy
each other. And the case is the same of the forces of all the matter
that lies without the interior spheroid PCBM. Therefore the body P is
attracted by the interior spheroid PCBM alone, and therefore (by Cor.
3, Prop. LXXII) its attraction is to the force with which the body A is
attracted by the whole spheroid AGOD as the distance PS to the distance

the distance between the corpuscle and the plane compared with
the dimensions of the attracting body be extremely small; and the
attracting body consist of homogeneous particles, whose attractive
forces decrease in the ratio of any power of the distances greater
than the quadruplicate; the attractive force of the whole body will
decrease very nearly in the ratio of a power whose side is that
very small distance, and the index less by 3 than the index of the
former power. This assertion does not hold good, however, of a body
consisting of particles whose attractive forces decrease in the ratio
of the triplicate power of the distances; because, in that case, the
attraction of the remoter part of the infinite body in the second
Corollary is always infinitely greater than the attraction of the

<p>If a body is attracted perpendicularly towards a given plane, and from
the law of attraction given, the motion of the body be required; the
Problem will be solved by seeking (by Prop. XXXIX) the motion of the
body descending in a right line towards that plane, and (by Cor. 2, of
the Laws) compounding that motion with an uniform motion performed in
the direction of lines parallel to that plane. And, on the contrary, if
there be required the law of the attraction tending towards the plane
in perpendicular directions, by which the body may be caused to move in
any given curve line, the Problem will be solved by working after the
manner of the third Problem.</p>

<p>These attractions bear a great resemblance to the reflexions and
refractions of light made in a given ratio of the secants, as was
discovered by <i>Snellius</i>; and consequently in a given ratio of the
sines, as was exhibited by <i>Des Cartes</i>. For it is now certain
from the phenomena of <i>Jupiter's</i> satellites, confirmed by the
observations of different astronomers, that light is propagated in
succession, and requires about seven or eight minutes to travel from
the sun to the earth. Moreover, the rays of light that are in our air
(as lately was discovered by <i>Grimaldus</i>, by the admission of
light into a dark room through a small hole, which I have also tried)
in their passage near the angles of bodies, whether transparent or
opaque (such as the circular and rectangular edges of gold, silver
and brass coins, or of knives, or broken pieces of stone or glass),
are bent or inflected round those bodies as if they were attracted to
them; and those rays which in their passage come nearest to the bodies
are the most inflected, as if they were most attracted; which thing I
myself have also carefully observed. And those which pass at greater
distances are less inflected; and those at still greater distances are
a little inflected the contrary way, and form three fringes of colours.</p>

In the figure <i>s</i> represents the edge of a knife, or any kind

<i>dlsld</i>, are rays inflected towards the knife in the arcs
<i>owo</i>, <i>nvn</i>, <i>mtm</i>, <i>lsl</i>; which inflection is
greater or less according to their distance from the knife. Now since
this inflection of the rays is performed in the air without the knife,
it follows that the rays which fall upon the knife are first inflected
in the air before they touch the knife. And the case is the same of
the rays falling upon glass. The refraction, therefore, is made not in
the point of incidence, but gradually, by a continual inflection of
the rays; which is done partly in the air before they touch the glass,
partly (if I mistake not) within the glass, after they have entered it;
as is represented in the rays <i>ckzc</i>, <i>biyb</i>, <i>ahxa</i>,
falling upon <i>r</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>p</i>, and inflected between

Therefore because of the analogy there is between the propagation of
the rays of light and the motion of bodies, I thought it not amiss to
add the following Propositions for optical uses; not at all considering
the nature of the rays of light, or inquiring whether they are bodies
or not; but only determining the trajectories of bodies which are
extremely like the trajectories of the rays.</p>

<p>Let a line joining AB cut the first superficies in C and the second in
E, the point D being taken any how at pleasure. And supposing the sine
of incidence on the first superficies to the sine of emergence from
the same, and the sine of emergence from the second superficies to the
sine of incidence on the same, to be as any given quantity M to another
given quantity N; then produce AB to G, so that BG may be to CE as M
- N to N; and AD to H, so that AH may be equal to AG; and DF to K, so
that DK may be to DH as N to M. Join KB, and about the centre D with
the interval DH describe a circle meeting KB produced in L, and draw BF
parallel to DL; and the point F will touch the line EF, which, being
turned round the axis AB, will describe the superficies sought. Q.E.F.</p>

<p>For conceive the lines CP, CQ to be every where perpendicular to AD,
DF, and the lines ER, ES to FB, FD respectively, and therefore QS to be
always equal to CE; and (by Cor. 2, Prop. XCVII) PD will be to QD as M
to N, and therefore as DL to DK, or FB to FK; and by division as DL -
FB or PH - PD - FB to FD or FQ - QD; and by composition as PH - FB to
FQ, that is (because PH and CG, QS and CE, are equal), as CE + BG - FR
to CE - FS. But (because BG is to CE as M - N to N) it comes to pass
also that CE + BG is to CE as M to N; and therefore, by division, FR is
to FS as M to N; and therefore (by Cor. 2, Prop. XCVII) the superficies
EF compels a body, falling upon it in the direction DF, to go on in the
line FR to the place B. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>In the same manner one may go on to three or more superficies. But of
all figures the sphærical is the most proper for optical uses. If the
object glasses of telescopes were made of two glasses of a sphærical
figure, containing water between them, it is not unlikely that the
errors of the refractions made in the extreme parts of the superficies
of the glasses may be accurately enough corrected by the refractions
of the water. Such object glasses are to be preferred before elliptic
and hyperbolic glasses, not only because they may be formed with more
ease and accuracy, but because the pencils of rays situate without
the axis of the glass would be more accurately refracted by them. But
the different refrangibility of different rays is the real obstacle
that hinders optics from being made perfect by sphærical or any other
figures. Unless the errors thence arising can be corrected, all the
labour spent in correcting the others is quite thrown away.</p>

<p><i>If a body is resisted in the ratio of its velocity, the motion lost
by resistance is as the space gone over in its motion.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For since the motion lost in each equal particle of time is as the
velocity, that is, as the particle of space gone over, then, by
composition, the motion lost in the whole time will be as the whole
space gone over. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. Therefore if the body, destitute of all gravity, move by its
innate force only in free spaces, and there be given both its whole
motion at the beginning, and also the motion remaining after some part
of the way is gone over, there will be given also the whole space which
the body can describe in an infinite time. For that space will be to
the space now described as the whole motion at the beginning is to the
part lost of that motion.</p>

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION II. THEOREM II.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If a body is resisted in the ratio of its velocity, and moves, by
its <span class="antiqua">vis insita</span> only, through a similar medium, and the times be
taken equal, the velocities in the beginning of each of the times are
in a geometrical progression, and the spaces described in each of the
times are as the velocities.</i></p>
</div>

<p>CASE 1. Let the time be divided into equal particles; and if at the
very beginning of each particle we suppose the resistance to act
with one single impulse which is as the velocity, the decrement
of the velocity in each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span> the particles of time will be as
the same velocity. Therefore the velocities are proportional to
their differences, and therefore (by Lem. 1, Book II) continually
proportional. Therefore if out of an equal number of particles there
be compounded any equal portions of time, the velocities at the
beginning of those times will be as terms in a continued progression,
which are taken by intervals, omitting every where an equal number of
intermediate terms. But the ratios of these terms are compounded of the
equal ratios of the intermediate terms equally repeated, and therefore
are equal. Therefore the velocities, being proportional to those terms,
are in geometrical progression. Let those equal particles of time be
diminished, and their number increased <i>in infinitum</i>, so that the
impulse of resistance may become continual; and the velocities at the
beginnings of equal times, always continually proportional, will be
also in this case continually proportional. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 2. And, by division, the differences of the velocities, that is,
the parts of the velocities lost in each of the times, are as the
wholes; but the spaces described in each of the times are as the lost
parts of the velocities (by Prop. 1, Book I), and therefore are also as
the wholes. Q.E.D.</p>

at the very beginning of the motion, be expressed by any given line

time may be expressed by the area ABGD, and the space described in
that time by the line AD. For if that area, by the motion of the point
D, be uniformly increased in the same manner as the time, the right
line DC will decrease in a geometrical ratio in the same manner as the
velocity; and the parts of the right line AC, described in equal times,

<p>For let the rectangle BACH be resolved into innumerable rectangles
A<i>k</i>, K<i>l</i>, L<i>m</i>, M<i>n</i>, &amp;c., which shall be as the

0, A<i>k</i>, A<i>l</i>, A<i>m</i>, A<i>n</i>, &amp;c., be as the whole

ABHC to AB<i>k</i>K, as the force of gravity to the resistance in the

the resistances, and ABHC, K<i>k</i>HC, L<i>l</i>HC, M<i>m</i>HC,

I) as the increments of the velocities, that is, as the rectangles
A<i>k</i>, K<i>l</i>, L<i>m</i>, M<i>n</i>, &amp;c., and therefore (by
Lem. 1, Book II) in a geometrical progression. Therefore, if the

the like reasoning, the areas <i>q</i>KL<i>r</i>, <i>r</i>LM<i>s</i>,

<i>smnt</i>, &amp;c., as the gravitating forces to the resistances in the

the equal areas BAK<i>q</i>, <i>q</i>KL<i>r</i>, <i>r</i>LM<i>s</i>,

areas B<i>kq</i>, <i>qklr</i>, <i>rlms</i>, <i>smnt</i>, &amp;c., will be
analogous to the resistances in the middle of each of the times, that
is (by supposition), to the velocities, and so to the spaces described.
Take the sums of the analogous quantities, and the areas B<i>kq</i>,
B<i>lr</i>, B<i>ms</i>, B<i>nt</i>, &amp;c., will be analogous to the
whole spaces described; and also the areas AB<i>q</i>K, AB<i>r</i>L,
AB<i>s</i>M, AB<i>t</i>N, &amp;c., to the times. Therefore the body, in
descending, will in any time AB<i>r</i>L describe the space B<i>lr</i>,
and in the time L<i>rt</i>N the space <i>rlnt</i>. Q.E.D. And the like
demonstration holds in ascending motion.</p>

<p>COROL. 1. Therefore the greatest velocity that the body can acquire
by falling is to the velocity acquired in any given time as the given
force of gravity which perpetually acts upon it to the resisting force
which opposes it at the end of that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>COROL. 2. But the time being augmented in an arithmetical progression,
the sum of that greatest velocity and the velocity in the ascent,
and also their difference in the descent, decreases in a geometrical
progression.</p>

<p>COROL. 3. Also the differences of the spaces, which are described
in equal differences of the times, decrease in the same geometrical
progression.</p>

<p>COROL. 4. The space described by the body is the difference of two
spaces, whereof one is as the time taken from the beginning of the
descent, and the other as the velocity; which [spaces] also at the

× DA being given, there is given both the resistance of the medium at
the beginning of the motion, and the latus rectum of the parabola; and
thence the velocity at the beginning of the motion is given also. Then
from the length of the tangent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span> L there is given both the velocity
proportional to it, and the resistance proportional to the velocity in
any place <i>r</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 6. But since the length 2DP is to the latus rectum of the
parabola as the gravity to the resistance in D; and, from the velocity
augmented, the resistance is augmented in the same ratio, but the latus
rectum of the parabola is augmented in the duplicate of that ratio, it
is plain that the length 2DP is augmented in that simple ratio only;
and is therefore always proportional to the velocity; nor will it be
augmented or diminished by the change of the angle CDP, unless the
velocity be also changed.</p>

<p>COR. 7. Hence appears the method of determining the curve D<i>ra</i>F
nearly from the phenomena, and thence collecting the resistance
and velocity with which the body is projected. Let two similar and
equal bodies be projected with the same velocity, from the place
D, in different angles CDP, CD<i>p</i>; and let the places F,
<i>f</i>, where they fall upon the horizontal plane DC, be known.
Then taking any length for DP or D<i>p</i> suppose the resistance
in D to be to the gravity in any ratio whatsoever, and let that
ratio be expounded by any length SM. Then, by computation, from that
assumed length DP, find the lengths DF, D<i>f</i>; and from the ratio
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{F}f}{\mathrm{DF}}" src="images/371.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 4.201ex; height: 4.676ex;" id="img_images_371.svg">,</span> found by calculation, subduct the
same ratio as found by experiment; and let the difference be expounded
by the perpendicular MN. Repeat the same a second and a third time,
by assuming always a new ratio SM of the resistance to the gravity,
and collecting a new difference MN. Draw the affirmative differences
on one side of the right line SM, and the negative on the other side;
and through the points N, N, N, draw a regular curve NNN, cutting the
right line SMMM in X, and SX will be the true ratio of the resistance
to the gravity, which was to be found. From this ratio the length DF is
to be collected by calculation; and a length, which is to the assumed
length DP as the length DF known by experiment to the length DF just
now found, will be the true length DP. This being known, you will have
both the curve line D<i>ra</i>F which the body describes, and also the
velocity and resistance of the body in each place.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>But, yet, that the resistance of bodies is in the ratio of the
velocity, is more a mathematical hypothesis than a physical one. In
mediums void of all tenacity, the resistances made to bodies are in the
duplicate ratio of the velocities. For by the action of a swifter body,
a greater motion in proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> to a greater velocity is communicated
to the same quantity of the medium in a less time; and in an equal
time, by reason of a greater quantity of the disturbed medium, a motion
is communicated in the duplicate ratio greater; and the resistance (by
Law II and III) is as the motion communicated. Let us, therefore, see
what motions arise from this law of resistance.</p>

</figure>

<p>For since the resistance of the medium is proportional to the square of
the velocity, and the decrement of the velocity is proportional to the
resistance: if the time be divided into innumerable equal particles,
the squares of the velocities at the beginning of each of the times
will be proportional to the differences of the same velocities. Let
those particles of time be AK, KL, LM, &amp;c., taken in the right line CD;
and erect the perpendiculars AB, K<i>k</i>, L<i>l</i>, M<i>m</i>, &amp;c.,
meeting the hyperbola B<i>klm</i>G, described with the centre C, and
the rectangular asymptotes CD, CH, in B, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>,
&amp;c.; then AB will be to K<i>k</i> as CK to CA, and, by division, AB -
K<i>k</i> to K<i>k</i> as AK to CA, and alternately, AB - K<i>k</i>
to AK as K<i>k</i> to CA; and therefore as AB × K<i>k</i> to AB ×
CA. Therefore since AK and AB × CA are given, AB - K<i>k</i> will be
as AB × K<i>k</i>; and, lastly, when AB and K<i>k</i> coincide, as
AB<sup>2</sup>. And, by the like reasoning, K<i>k</i> - L<i>l</i>, L<i>l</i> -
M<i>m</i>, &amp;c., will be as K<i>k<sup>2</sup></i>, L<i>l<sup>2</sup></i>, &amp;c. Therefore
the squares of the lines AB, K<i>k</i>, L<i>l</i>, M<i>m</i>, &amp;c.,
are as their differences; and, therefore, since the squares of the
velocities were shewn above to be as their differences, the progression
of both will be alike. This being demonstrated it follows also that
the areas described by these lines are in a like progression with the
spaces described by these velocities. Therefore if the velocity at the
beginning of the first time AK be expounded by the line AB,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span> and the
velocity at the beginning of the second time KL by the line K<i>k</i>
and the length described in the first time by the area AK<i>k</i>B,
all the following velocities will be expounded by the following lines
L<i>l</i>, M<i>m</i>, &amp;c. and the lengths described, by the areas
K<i>l</i>, L<i>m</i>, &amp;c. And, by composition, if the whole time be
expounded by AM, the sum of its parts, the whole length described will
be expounded by AM<i>m</i>B the sum of its parts. Now conceive the time
AM to be divided into the parts AK, KL, LM, &amp;c. so that CA, CK, CL,
CM, &amp;c. may be in a geometrical progression; and those parts will be
in the same progression, and the velocities AB, K<i>k</i>, L<i>l</i>,
M<i>m</i>, &amp;c., will be in the same progression inversely, and the
spaces described A<i>k</i>, K<i>l</i>, L<i>m</i>, &amp;c., will be equal.

<p>COR. 1. Hence it appears, that if the time be expounded by any part
AD of the asymptote, and the velocity in the beginning of the time by
the ordinate AB, the velocity at the end of the time will be expounded
by the ordinate DG; and the whole space described by the adjacent
hyperbolic area ABGD; and the space which any body can describe in the
same time AD, with the first velocity AB, in a non-resisting medium, by
the rectangle AB × AD.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Hence the space described in a resisting medium is given, by
taking it to the space described with the uniform velocity AB in a
non-resisting medium, as the hyperbolic area ABGD to the rectangle AB ×
AD.</p>

<p>COR. 3. The resistance of the medium is also given, by making it
equal, in the very beginning of the motion, to an uniform centripetal
force, which could generate, in a body falling through a non-resisting
medium, the velocity AB in the time AC. For if BT be drawn touching
the hyperbola in B, and meeting the asymptote in T, the right line
AT will be equal to AC, and will express the time in which the first
resistance, uniformly continued, may take away the whole velocity AB.</p>

<p>COR. 4. And thence is also given the proportion of this resistance to
the force of gravity, or any other given centripetal force.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And, <i>vice versa</i>, if there is given the proportion of the
resistance to any given centripetal force, the time AC is also given,
in which a centripetal force equal to the resistance may generate any
velocity as AB; and thence is given the point B, through which the
hyperbola, having CH, CD for its asymptotes, is to be described: as
also the space ABGD, which a body, by beginning its motion with that
velocity AB, can describe in any time AD, in a similar resisting medium.</p>

</div>

<p>For the parts of the motions lost are as the resistances and times
conjunctly. Therefore, that those parts may be proportional to the
wholes, the resistance and time conjunctly ought to be as the motion.
Therefore the time will be as the motion directly and the resistance
inversely. Wherefore the particles of the times being taken in that
ratio, the bodies will always lose parts of their motions proportional
to the wholes, and therefore will retain velocities always proportional
to their first velocities. And because of the given ratio of the
velocities, they will always describe spaces which are as the first
velocities and the times conjunctly. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore if bodies equally swift are resisted in a duplicate
ratio of their diameters, homogeneous globes moving with any velocities
whatsoever, by describing spaces proportional to their diameters,
will lose parts of their motions proportional to the wholes. For the
motion of each globe will be as its velocity and mass conjunctly, that
is, as the velocity and the cube of its diameter; the resistance (by
supposition) will be as the square of the diameter and the square of
the velocity conjunctly; and the time (by this proposition) is in the
former ratio directly, and in the latter inversely, that is, as the
diameter directly and the velocity inversely; and therefore the space,
which is proportional to the time and velocity is as the diameter.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If bodies equally swift are resisted in a sesquiplicate ratio
of their diameters, homogeneous globes, moving with any velocities
whatsoever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span> by describing spaces that are in a sesquiplicate ratio of
the diameters, will lose parts of their motions proportional to the
wholes.</p>

<p>COR. 3. And universally, if equally swift bodies are resisted in the
ratio of any power of the diameters, the spaces, in which homogeneous
globes, moving with any velocity whatsoever, will lose parts of their
motions proportional to the wholes, will be as the cubes of the
diameters applied to that power. Let those diameters be D and E; and if
the resistances, where the velocities are supposed equal, are as D<sup>n</sup>
and E<sup>n</sup>; the spaces in which the globes, moving with any velocities
whatsoever, will lose parts of their motions proportional to the
wholes, will be as <img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{D}^{3 - n}" src="images/372.svg" style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.921ex; height: 1.885ex;" id="img_images_372.svg"> and <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{E}^{3 - n}" src="images/373.svg" style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.733ex; height: 1.885ex;" id="img_images_373.svg">.</span>
And therefore homogeneous globes, in describing spaces proportional to

<p>COR. 4. Now if the globes are not homogeneous, the space described by
the denser globe must be augmented in the ratio of the density. For the
motion, with an equal velocity, is greater in the ratio of the density,
and the time (by this Prop.) is augmented in the ratio of motion
directly, and the space described in the ratio of the time.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And if the globes move in different mediums, the space, in
a medium which, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, resists the most, must be
diminished in the ratio of the greater resistance. For the time
(by this Prop.) will be diminished in the ratio of the augmented
resistance, and the space in the ratio of the time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The moment of any <span class="antiqua">genitum</span> is equal to the moments of each
of the generating sides drawn into the indices of the powers of those
sides, and into their co-efficients continually.</i></p>
</div>

<p>I call any quantity a <i>genitum</i> which is not made by addition or
subduction of divers parts, but is generated or produced in arithmetic
by the multiplication, division, or extraction of the root of any terms
whatsoever; in geometry by the invention of contents and sides, or
of the extremes and means of proportionals. Quantities of this kind
are products, quotients, roots, rectangles, squares, cubes, square
and cubic sides, and the like. These quantities I here consider as
variable and indetermined, and increasing or decreasing, as it were,
by a perpetual motion or flux; and I understand their momentaneous
increments or decrements by the name of moments; so that the increments
may be esteemed as added or affirmative moments; and the decrements
as subducted or negative ones. But take care not to look upon finite
particles as such. Finite particles are not moments, but the very
quantities generated by the moments. We are to conceive them as the
just nascent principles of finite magnitudes. Nor do we in this Lemma
regard the magnitude of the moments, but their first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> proportion, as
nascent. It will be the same thing, if, instead of moments, we use
either the velocities of the increments and decrements (which may also
be called the motions, mutations, and fluxions of quantities), or any
finite quantities proportional to those velocities. The co-efficient
of any generating side is the quantity which arises by applying the
genitum to that side.</p>

<p>In a letter of mine to Mr. <i>J. Collins</i>, dated <i>December 10,
1672</i>, having described a method of tangents, which I suspected to
be the same with <i>Slusius's</i> method, which at that time was not
made public, I subjoined these words: <i>This is one particular, or
rather a Corollary, of a general method,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span> which extends itself, without
any troublesome calculation, not only to the drawing of tangents to any
curve lines, whether geometrical or mechanical, or any how respecting
right lines or other curves, but also to the resolving other abstruser
kinds of problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centres
of gravity of curves, &amp;c.; nor is it (as <span class="antiqua">Hudden's</span> method de
<span class="antiqua">Maximis &amp; Minimis</span>) limited to equations which are free from surd
quantities. This method I have interwoven with that other of working in
equations, by reducing them to infinite series.</i> So far that letter.
And these last words relate to a treatise I composed on that subject in
the year 1671. The foundation of that general method is contained in
the preceding Lemma.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION VIII. THEOREM VI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If a body in an uniform medium, being uniformly acted upon by the
force of gravity, ascends or descends in a right line; and the whole
space described be distinguished into equal parts, and in the beginning
of each of the parts (by adding or subducting the resisting force of
the medium to or from the force of gravity, when the body ascends or
descends) you collect the absolute forces; I say, that those absolute
forces are in a geometrical progression.</i></p>

<p>For let the force of gravity be expounded by the given line AC; the
force of resistance by the indefinite line AK; the absolute force in
the descent of the body by the difference KC; the velocity of the body
by a line AP, which shall be a mean proportional between AK and AC,
and therefore in a subduplicate ratio of the resistance; the increment
of the resistance made in a given particle of time by the lineola KL,
and the contemporaneous increment of the velocity by the lineola PQ;
and with the centre C, and rectangular asymptotes CA, CH, describe any
hyperbola BNS meeting the erected perpendiculars AB, KN, LO in B, N
and O. Because AK is as AP<sup>2</sup>, the moment KL of the one will be as the
moment 2APQ of the other, that is, as AP × KC; for the increment PQ of
the velocity is (by Law II) proportional to the generating force KC.
Let the ratio of KL be compounded with the ratio KN, and the rectangle
KL × KN will become as AP × KC × KN; that is (because the rectangle
KC × KN is given), as AP. But the ultimate ratio of the hyperbolic
area KNOL to the rectangle KL × KN becomes, when the points K and L
coincide, the ratio of equality. Therefore that hyperbolic evanescent
area is as AP. Therefore the whole hyperbolic area ABOL is composed
of particles KNOL which are always proportional to the velocity AP;
and therefore is itself proportional to the space described with that
velocity. Let that area be now divided into equal parts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span> as ABMI,
IMNK, KNOL, &amp;c., and the absolute forces AC, IC, KC, LC, &amp;c., will be
in a geometrical progression. Q.E.D. And by a like reasoning, in the
ascent of the body, taking, on the contrary side of the point A, the
equal areas AB<i>mi</i>, <i>imnk</i>, <i>knol</i>, &amp;c., it will appear
that the absolute forces AC, <i>i</i>C, <i>k</i>C, <i>l</i>C, &amp;c., are
continually proportional. Therefore if all the spaces in the ascent and
descent are taken equal, all the absolute forces <i>l</i>C, <i>k</i>C,
<i>i</i>C, AC, IC, KC, LC, &amp;c., will be continually proportional. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if the space described be expounded by the hyperbolic
area ABNK, the force of gravity, the velocity of the body, and the
resistance of the medium, may be expounded by the lines AC, AP, and AK
respectively; and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And the greatest velocity which the body can ever acquire in an
infinite descent will be expounded by the line AC.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Therefore if the resistance of the medium answering to any
given velocity be known, the greatest velocity will be found, by taking
it to that given velocity in a ratio subduplicate of the ratio which
the force of gravity bears to that known resistance of the medium.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if AB be equal to a fourth part of AC, the space which a
body will describe by falling in any time will be to the space which
the body could describe, by moving uniformly on in the same time with
its greatest velocity AC, as the area ABNK, which expresses the space
described in falling to the area ATD, which expresses the time. For
since AC is to AP as AP to AK, then (by Cor. 1, Lem. II, of this Book)
LK is to PQ as 2AK to AP, that is, as 2AP to AC, and thence LK is to
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{PQ}" src="images/440.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.096ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_440.svg"> as AP to <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4}\mathrm{AC}" src="images/441.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.126ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_441.svg"> or AB;
and KN is to AC or AD as AB to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span> CK; and therefore, <i>ex æquo</i>, LKNO
to DPQ as AP to CK. But DPQ was to DTV as CK to AC. Therefore, <i>ex
æquo</i>, LKNO is to DTV as AP to AC; that is, as the velocity of the
falling body to the greatest velocity which the body by falling can
acquire. Since, therefore, the moments LKNO and DTV of the areas ABNK
and ATD are as the velocities, all the parts of those areas generated
in the same time will be as the spaces described in the same time; and
therefore the whole areas ABNK and ADT, generated from the beginning,
will be as the whole spaces described from the beginning of the
descent. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 2. The same is true also of the space described in the ascent.
That is to say, that all that space is to the space described in the
same time, with the uniform velocity AC, as the area AB<i>nk</i> is to
the sector AD<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 3. The velocity of the body, falling in the time ATD, is to the
velocity which it would acquire in the same time in a non-resisting
space, as the triangle APD to the hyperbolic sector ATD. For the
velocity in a non-resisting medium would be as the time ATD, and
in a resisting medium is as AP, that is, as the triangle APD. And
those velocities, at the beginning of the descent, are equal among
themselves, as well as those areas ATD, APD.</p>

<p>COR. 4. By the same argument, the velocity in the ascent is to the
velocity with which the body in the same time, in a non-resisting
space, would lose all its motion of ascent, as the triangle A<i>p</i>D
to the circular sector A<i>t</i>D; or as the right line A<i>p</i> to
the arc A<i>t</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 5. Therefore the time in which a body, by falling in a resisting
medium, would acquire the velocity AP, is to the time in which it would
acquire its greatest velocity AC, by falling in a non-resisting space,
as the sector ADT to the triangle ADC: and the time in which it would
lose its velocity A<i>p</i>, by ascending in a resisting medium, is to
the time in which it would lose the same velocity by ascending in a
non-resisting space, as the arc A<i>t</i> to its tangent A<i>p</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 6. Hence from the given time there is given the space described in
the ascent or descent. For the greatest velocity of a body descending
<i>in infinitum</i> is given (by Corol. 2 and 3, Theor. VI, of this
Book); and thence the time is given in which a body would acquire that
velocity by falling in a non-resisting space. And taking the sector
ADT or AD<i>t</i> to the triangle ADC in the ratio of the given time
to the time just now found, there will be given both the velocity AP
or A<i>p</i>, and the area ABNK or AB<i>nk</i>, which is to the sector
ADT, or AD<i>t</i>, as the space sought to the space which would, in
the given time, be uniformly described with that greatest velocity
found just before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>COR. 7. And by going backward, from the given space of ascent or
descent AB<i>nk</i> or ABNK, there will be given the time AD<i>t</i> or
ADT.</p>

<p>Let PQ be a plane perpendicular to the plane of the scheme itself;
PFHQ a curve line meeting that plane in the points P and Q; G, H, I,
K four places of the body going on in this curve from F to Q; and
GB, HC, ID, KE four parallel ordinates let fall from these points to
the horizon, and standing on the horizontal line PQ at the points
B, C, D, E; and let the distances BC, CD, DE, of the ordinates be
equal among themselves. From the points G and H let the right lines
GL, HN, be drawn touching the curve in G and H, and meeting the
ordinates CH, DI, produced upwards, in L and N: and complete the
parallelogram HCDM. And the times in which the body describes the
arcs GH, HI, will be in a subduplicate ratio of the altitudes LH, NI,
which the bodies would describe in those times, by falling from the
tangents; and the velocities will be as the lengths described GH, HI
directly, and the times inversely. Let the times be expounded by T and
<i>t</i>, and the velocities by <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{GH}}{\mathrm T}" src="images/442.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 4.468ex; height: 4.676ex;" id="img_images_442.svg"> and

This decrement arises from the
resistance which retards the body, and from the gravity which
accelerates it. Gravity, in a falling body, which in its fall describes
the space NI, produces a velocity with which it would be able to
describe twice that space in the same time, as <i>Galileo</i> has
demonstrated; that is, the velocity <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{2\mathrm{NI}}{t}" src="images/445.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 4.64ex; height: 4.652ex;" id="img_images_445.svg">:</span>

Let this velocity be added to the before-mentioned

the value of the ordinate be resolved into a converging series, the
Problem will be expeditiously solved by the first terms of the series;
as in the following examples.</p>

<p>EXAMPLE 1. Let the line PFHQ be a semi-circle described upon the
diameter PQ, to find the density of the medium that shall make a
projectile move in that line.</p>

<p>Bisect the diameter PQ in A; and call AQ, <i>n</i>; AC, <i>a</i>;
CH, <i>e</i>; and CD, <i>o</i>; then DI<sup>2</sup> or AQ<sup>2</sup> - AD<sup>2</sup> =
<i>nn</i> - <i>aa</i> - 2<i>ao</i> - <i>oo</i>, or <i>ee</i> -
2<i>ao</i> - <i>oo</i>; and the root being extracted by our method,
will give <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{DI} = e - \dfrac{ao}{e} - \dfrac{oo}{2e} - \dfrac{aaoo}{2e^{3}} - \dfrac{ao^{2}}{2e^{3}} - \dfrac{a^{3}o^{3}}{2e^{5}} - " src="images/469.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 43.811ex; height: 5.07ex;" id="img_images_469.svg">,</span>
&amp;c. Here put <i>nn</i> for <i>ee</i> + <i>aa</i>, and DI will become
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="= e - \dfrac{ao}{e} - \dfrac{nnoo}{2e^{3}} - \dfrac{anno^{3}}{2e^{5}} -" src="images/470.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.654ex; width: 29.687ex; height: 5.068ex;" id="img_images_470.svg">,</span>
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Such series I distinguish into successive terms after this manner:
I call that the first term in which the infinitely small quantity
<i>o</i> is not found; the second, in which that quantity is of one
dimension only; the third, in which it arises to two dimensions; the
fourth, in which it is of three; and so <i>ad infinitum</i>. And the
first term, which here is <i>e</i>, will always denote the length of
the ordinate CH, standing at the beginning of the indefinite quantity
<i>o</i>. The second term, which here is <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{ao}{e}" src="images/471.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.29ex; height: 4.104ex;" id="img_images_471.svg">,</span> will denote
the difference between CH and DN; that is, the lineola MN which is
cut off by completing the parallelogram HCDM; and therefore always
determines the position of the tangent HN; as, in this case, by taking
MN to HM as <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{ao}{e}" src="images/471.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 3.29ex; height: 4.104ex;" id="img_images_471.svg_1"> to <i>o</i>, or <i>a</i> to <i>e</i>. The
third term, which here is <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{nnoo}{2e^{3}}" src="images/472.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.652ex; width: 5.905ex; height: 4.182ex;" id="img_images_472.svg">,</span> will represent the
lineola IN, which lies between the tangent and the curve; and therefore
determines the angle of contact IHN, or the curvature which the curve
line<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span> has in H. If that lineola IN is of a finite magnitude, it will
be expressed by the third term, together with those that follow <i>in
infinitum</i>. But if that lineola be diminished <i>in infinitum</i>,
the terms following become infinitely less than the third term, and
therefore may be neglected. The fourth term determines the variation of
the curvature; the fifth, the variation of the variation; and so on.
Whence, by the way, appears no contemptible use of these series in the
solution of problems that depend upon tangents, and the curvature of
curves.</p>

<p>But if the same body should go from the place P, in the direction of

impeded by a resisting one.</p>

<p>Because there can be no motion in a parabola except in a non-resisting
medium, but in the hyperbolas here described it is produced by a
perpetual resistance; it is evident that the line which a projectile
describes in an uniformly resisting medium approaches nearer to these
hyperbolas than to a parabola. That line is certainly of the hyperbolic
kind, but about the vertex it is more distant from the asymptotes, and
in the parts remote from the vertex draws nearer to them than these
hyperbolas here described. The difference, however, is not so great
between the one and the other but that these latter may be commodiously
enough used in practice instead of the former. And perhaps these may
prove more useful than an hyperbola that is more accurate, and at the
same time more compounded. They may be made use of, then, in this
manner.</p>

<p>Therefore if a body projected from the place A, in the direction
of the right line AH, describes the hyperbola AGK and AH produced
meets the asymptote NX in H, and AI drawn parallel to it meets
the other asymptote MX in I; the density of the medium in A
will be reciprocally as AH, and the velocity of the body as
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{\tfrac{\mathrm{AH}^{2}}{\mathrm{AI}}}" src="images/528.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.098ex; width: 6.401ex; height: 4.208ex;" id="img_images_528.svg">,</span> and the resistance

Hence the following rules are deduced.</p>

<p>RULE 1. If the density of the medium at A, and the velocity with which
the body is projected remain the same, and the angle NAH be changed,
the lengths AH, AI, HX will remain. Therefore if those lengths, in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
one case, are found, the hyperbola may afterwards be easily determined
from any given angle NAH.</p>

<p>RULE 2. If the angle NAH, and the density of the medium at A, remain
the same, and the velocity with which the body is projected be changed,
the length AH will continue the same; and AI will be changed in a
duplicate ratio of the velocity reciprocally.</p>

<p>RULE 3. If the angle NAH, the velocity of the body at A, and the
accelerative gravity remain the same, and the proportion of the
resistance at A to the motive gravity be augmented in any ratio; the
proportion of AH to AI will be augmented in the same ratio, the latus
rectum of the above-mentioned parabola remaining the same, and also
the length <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{AH}^{2}}{\mathrm{AI}}" src="images/530.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 5.377ex; height: 5.149ex;" id="img_images_530.svg"> proportional to it;
and therefore AH will be diminished in the same ratio, and AI will be
diminished in the duplicate of that ratio. But the proportion of the
resistance to the weight is augmented, when either the specific gravity
is made less, the magnitude remaining equal, or when the density of
the medium is made greater, or when, by diminishing the magnitude, the
resistance becomes diminished in a less ratio than the weight.</p>

<p>RULE 4. Because the density of the medium is greater near the vertex
of the hyperbola than it is in the place A, that a mean density may be
preserved, the ratio of the least of the tangents GT to the tangent AH
ought to be found, and the density in A augmented in a ratio a little
greater than that of half the sum of those tangents to the least of the
tangents GT.</p>

<p>RULE 5. If the lengths AH, AI are given, and the figure AGK is to be
described, produce HN to X, so that HX may be to AI as <i>n</i> + 1
to 1; and with the centre X, and the asymptotes MX, NX, describe an
hyperbola through the point A, such that AI may be to any of the lines
VG as XV<sup>n</sup> to XI<sup>n</sup>.</p>

<p>RULE 6. By how much the greater the number <i>n</i> is, so much the
more accurate are these hyperbolas in the ascent of the body from A,
and less accurate in its descent to K; and the contrary. The conic
hyperbola keeps a mean ratio between these, and is more simple than
the rest. Therefore if the hyperbola be of this kind, and you are to
find the point K, where the projected body falls upon any right line AN
passing through the point A, let AN produced meet the asymptotes MX, NX
in M and N, and take NK equal to AM.</p>

<img alt="How the conic hyperbola keeps a mean ratio between these, and is more simple than the rest." height="194" src="images/i_277.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i_277.jpg">
</figure>

<p>RULE 7. And hence appears an expeditious method of determining this
hyperbola from the phenomena. Let two similar and equal bodies be
projected with the same velocity, in different angles HAK, <i>h</i>Ak,
and let them fall upon the plane of the horizon in K and <i>k</i>;
and note the proportion of AK to A<i>k</i>. Let it be as <i>d</i> to
<i>e</i>. Then erecting a perpendicular AI of any length, assume any
how the length AH or A<i>h</i>, and thence graphically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span> or by scale
and compass, collect the lengths AK, Ak (by Rule 6). If the ratio of
AK to Ak be the same with that of d to e, the length of AH was rightly
assumed. If not, take on the indefinite right line SM, the length SM
equal to the assumed AH; and erect a perpendicular MN equal to the
difference <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{AK}}{\mathrm{A}k} - \dfrac{d}{e}" src="images/531.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 9.39ex; height: 4.726ex;" id="img_images_531.svg"> of
the ratios drawn into any given right line. By the like method, from
several assumed lengths AH, you may find several points N; and draw
through them all a regular curve NNXN, cutting the right line SMMM in
X. Lastly, assume AH equal to the abscissa SX, and thence find again
the length AK; and the lengths, which are to the assumed length AI, and
this last AH, as the length AK known by experiment, to the length AK
last found, will be the true lengths AI and AH, which were to be found.
But these being given, there will be given also the resisting force of
the medium in the place A, it being to the force of gravity as AH to
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{4}{3}\mathrm{AI}" src="images/532.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 4.64ex; height: 4.663ex;" id="img_images_532.svg">.</span> Let the density of the medium be increased
by Rule 4, and if the resisting force just found be increased in the
same ratio, it will become still more accurate.</p>

<p>RULE 8. The lengths AH, HX being found; let there be now required the
position of the line AH, according to which a projectile thrown with
that given velocity shall fall upon any point K. At the points A and
K, erect the lines AC, KF perpendicular to the horizon; whereof let AC

With the asymptotes AK, KF, describe an hyperbola, whose conjugate
shall pass through the point C; and from the centre A, with the
interval AH, describe a circle cutting that hyperbola in the point H;
then the projectile thrown in the direction of the right line AH will
fall upon the point K. Q.E.I. For the point H, because of the given
length AH, must be somewhere in the circumference of the described
circle. Draw CH meeting AK and KF in E and F; and because CH, MX are
parallel, and AC, AI equal, AE will be equal to AM, and therefore also
equal to KN. But CE is to AE as FH to KN, and therefore CE and FH are
equal. Therefore the point H falls upon the hyperbolic curve described
with the asymptotes AK, KF whose conjugate passes through the point C;
and is therefore found in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span> common intersection of this hyperbolic
curve and the circumference of the described circle. Q.E.D. It is to
be observed that this operation is the same, whether the right line
AKN be parallel to the horizon, or inclined thereto in any angle; and
that from two intersections H, <i>h</i>, there arise two angles NAH,
NA<i>h</i>; and that in mechanical practice it is sufficient once
to describe a circle, then to apply a ruler CH, of an indeterminate
length, so to the point C, that its part FH, intercepted between the
circle and the right line FK, may be equal to its part CE placed
between the point C and the right line AK.</p>

<p>What has been said of hyperbolas may be easily applied to parabolas.
For if a parabola be represented by XAGK, touched by a right line
XV in the vertex X, and the ordinates IA, VG be as any powers XI<sup>n</sup>,
XV<sup>n</sup>, of the abscissas XI, XV; draw XT, GT, AH, whereof let XT be

body projected from any place A, in the direction of the right line
AH, with a due velocity, will describe this parabola, if the density
of the medium in each of the places G be reciprocally as the tangent
GT. In that case the velocity in G will be the same as would cause a
body, moving in a non-resisting space, to describe a conic parabola,
having G for its vertex, VG produced downwards for its diameter, and

NAK represent an horizontal line, and both the density of the medium

Therefore since the area DPQ is as BD<sup>2</sup> - BP<sup>2</sup>, the area DTV will be
as the given quantity BD<sup>2</sup>. Therefore the area EDT increases uniformly
in the several equal particles of time by the addition of as many
given particles DTV, and therefore is proportional to the time of the
descent. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. If with the centre D and the semi-diameter DA there be drawn
through the vertex A an arc A<i>t</i> similar to the arc ET, and
similarly subtending the angle ADT, the velocity AP will be to the
velocity which the body in the time EDT, in a non-resisting space,
can lose in its ascent, or acquire in its descent, as the area of
the triangle DAP to the area of the sector DA<i>t</i>; and therefore
is given from the time given. For the velocity in a non-resisting
medium is proportional to the time, and therefore to this sector; in
a resisting medium, it is as the triangle; and in both mediums, where
it is least, it approaches to the ratio of equality, as the sector and
triangle do.</p>

<p>The resistance of spherical bodies in fluids arises partly from the
tenacity, partly from the attrition, and partly from the density of the
medium. And that part of the resistance which arises from the density
of the fluid is, as I said, in a duplicate ratio of the velocity; the
other part, which arises from the tenacity of the fluid, is uniform, or
as the moment of the time; and, therefore, we might now proceed to the
motion of bodies, which are resisted partly by an uniform force, or in
the ratio of the moments of the time, and partly in the duplicate ratio
of the velocity. But it is sufficient to have cleared the way to this
speculation in Prop. VIII and IX foregoing, and their Corollaries. For
in those Propositions, instead of the uniform resistance made to an
ascending body arising from its gravity, one may substitute the uniform
resistance which arises from the tenacity of the medium, when the body
moves by its <i>vis insita</i> alone; and when the body ascends in a
right line, add this uniform resistance to the force of gravity, and
subduct it when the body descends in a right line. One might also go
on to the motion of bodies which are resisted in part uniformly, in
part in the ratio of the velocity, and in part in the duplicate ratio
of the same velocity. And I have opened a way to this in Prop. XIII
and XIV foregoing, in which the uniform resistance arising from the
tenacity of the medium may be substituted for the force of gravity, or
be compounded with it as before. But I hasten to other things.</p>

which passes through the points OSP will pass also through the point Q.
Let the points P and Q coincide, and this circle will touch the spiral
in the place of coincidence PQ, and will therefore cut the right line
OP perpendicularly. Therefore OP will become a diameter of this circle,

<p>Suppose every thing to be as in the foregoing Lemma, and produce
SQ to V so that SV may be equal to SP. In any time let a body, in
a resisting medium, describe the least arc PQ, and in double the
time the least arc PR; and the decrements of those arcs arising from
the resistance, or their differences from the arcs which would be
described in a non-resisting medium in the same times, will be to
each other as the squares of the times in which they are generated;
therefore the decrement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span> arc PQ, is the fourth part of the
decrement of the arc PR. Whence also if the area QS<i>r</i> be
taken equal to the area PSQ, the decrement of the arc PQ will be
equal to half the lineola R<i>r</i>; and therefore the force of
resistance and the centripetal force are to each other as the lineola

which is generated by that force, is in a ratio compounded of the
ratio of this force and the duplicate ratio of the time in which the

continually proportional, describe as many circles; and suppose the
time of the revolutions between the perimeters of any two of those
circles, in the medium whereof we treated, to be to the time of the
revolutions between the same in the medium proposed as the mean density
of the proposed medium between those circles to the mean density of the
medium whereof we treated, between the same circles, nearly: and that
the secant of the angle in which the spiral above determined, in the
medium whereof we treated, cuts the radius AS, is in the same ratio
to the secant of the angle in which the new spiral, in the proposed
medium, cuts the same radius: and also that the number of all the
revolutions between the same two circles is nearly as the tangents of
those angles. If this be done every where between every two circles,
the motion will be continued through all the circles. And by this means
one may without difficulty conceive at what rate and in what time
bodies ought to revolve in any regular medium.</p>

<p>COR. 9. And although these motions becoming eccentrical should be
performed in spirals approaching to an oval figure, yet, conceiving
the several revolutions of those spirals to be at the same distances
from each other, and to approach to the centre by the same degrees as
the spiral above described, we may also understand how the motions of
bodies may be performed in spirals of that kind.</p>

Whence, in mediums whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> force of resistance is not as the density,
the density must be so much augmented or diminished, that either the

<i>A fluid is any body whose parts yield to any force impressed on it,
by yielding, are easily moved among themselves.</i></p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XIX. THEOREM XIV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>All the parts of a homogeneous and unmoved fluid included in any
unmoved vessel, and compressed on every side (setting aside the
consideration of condensation, gravity, and all centripetal forces),
will be equally pressed on every side, and remain in their places

</figure>

<p>CASE 1. Let a fluid be included in the spherical vessel ABC, and
uniformly compressed on every side: I say, that no part of it will be
moved by that pressure. For if any part, as D, be moved, all such parts
at the same distance from the centre on every side must necessarily
be moved at the same time by a like motion; because the pressure of
them all is similar and equal; and all other motion is excluded that
does not arise from that pressure. But if these parts come all of them
nearer to the centre, the fluid must be condensed towards the centre,
contrary to the supposition. If they recede from it, the fluid must
be condensed towards the circumference; which is also contrary to the
supposition. Neither can they move in any one direction retaining their
distance from the centre, because for the same reason, they may move in
a contrary direction; but the same part cannot be moved contrary ways
at the same time. Therefore no part of the fluid will be moved from its
place. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 2. I say now, that all the spherical parts of this fluid are
equally pressed on every side. For let EF be a spherical part of the
fluid; if this be not pressed equally on every side, augment the lesser
pressure till it be pressed equally on every side; and its parts (by
Case 1) will remain in their places. But before the increase of the
pressure, they would remain in their places (by Case 1); and by the
addition of a new pressure they will be moved, by the definition of a
fluid, from those places. Now these two conclusions contradict each
other. Therefore it was false to say that the sphere EF was not pressed
equally on every side. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 3. I say besides, that different spherical parts have equal
pressures. For the contiguous spherical parts press each other mutually
and equally in the point of contact (by Law III). But (by Case 2)
they are pressed on every side with the same force. Therefore any two
spherical parts not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span> contiguous, since an intermediate spherical part
can touch both, will be pressed with the same force. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 4. I say now, that all the parts of the fluid are every where
pressed equally. For any two parts may be touched by spherical parts in
any points whatever; and there they will equally press those spherical
parts (by Case 3), and are reciprocally equally pressed by them (by Law
III). Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 5. Since, therefore, any part GHI of the fluid is inclosed by the
rest of the fluid as in a vessel, and is equally pressed on every side;
and also its parts equally press one another, and are at rest among
themselves; it is manifest that all the parts of any fluid as GHI,
which is pressed equally on every side, do press each other mutually
and equally, and are at rest among themselves. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>CASE 6. Therefore if that fluid be included in a vessel of a yielding
substance, or that is not rigid, and be not equally pressed on every
side, the same will give way to a stronger pressure, by the Definition
of fluidity.</p>

<p>CASE 7. And therefore, in an inflexible or rigid vessel, a fluid will
not sustain a stronger pressure on one side than on the other, but
will give way to it, and that in a moment of time; because the rigid
side of the vessel does not follow the yielding liquor. But the fluid,
by thus yielding, will press against the opposite side, and so the
pressure will tend on every side to equality. And because the fluid,
as soon as it endeavours to recede from the part that is most pressed,
is withstood by the resistance of the vessel on the opposite side, the
pressure will on every side be reduced to equality, in a moment of
time, without any local motion: and from thence the parts of the fluid
(by Case 5) will press each other mutually and equally, and be at rest
among themselves. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. Whence neither will a motion of the parts of the fluid among
themselves be changed by a pressure communicated to the external

be somewhere altered, or that all the parts of the fluid, by pressing

difficulty among themselves.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XX. THEOREM XV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If all the parts of a spherical fluid, homogeneous at equal
distances from the centre, lying on a spherical concentric bottom,
gravitate towards the centre of the whole, the bottom will sustain
the weight of a cylinder, whose base is equal to the superficies of
the bottom, and whose altitude is the same with that of the incumbent
fluid.</i></p>

</figure>

<p>Let DHM be the superficies of the bottom, and AEI the upper superficies
of the fluid. Let the fluid be distinguished into concentric orbs of
equal thickness, by the innumerable spherical superficies BFK, CGL:
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span> conceive the force of gravity to act only in the upper superficies
of every orb, and the actions to be equal on the equal parts of all
the superficies. Therefore the upper superficies AE is pressed by the
single force of its own gravity, by which all the parts of the upper
orb, and the second superficies BFK, will (by Prop. XIX), according
to its measure, be equally pressed. The second superficies BFK is
pressed likewise by the force of its own gravity, which, added to the
former force, makes the pressure double. The third superficies CGL is,
according to its measure, acted on by this pressure and the force of
its own gravity besides, which makes its pressure triple. And in like
manner the fourth superficies receives a quadruple pressure, the fifth
superficies a quintuple, and so on. Therefore the pressure acting on
every superficies is not as the solid quantity of the incumbent fluid,
but as the number of the orbs reaching to the upper surface of the
fluid; and is equal to the gravity of the lowest orb multiplied by
the number of orbs: that is, to the gravity of a solid whose ultimate
ratio to the cylinder above-mentioned (when the number of the orbs is
increased and their thickness diminished, <i>ad infinitum</i>, so that
the action of gravity from the lowest superficies to the uppermost
may become continued) is the ratio of equality. Therefore the lowest
superficies sustains the weight of the cylinder above determined.
Q.E.D. And by a like reasoning the Proposition will be evident, where
the gravity of the fluid decreases in any assigned ratio of the
distance from the centre, and also where the fluid is more rare above
and denser below. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore the bottom is not pressed by the whole weight of the
incumbent fluid, but only sustains that part of it which is described
in the Proposition; the rest of the weight being sustained archwise by
the spherical figure of the fluid.</p>

<p>COR. 2. The quantity of the pressure is the same always at equal
distances from the centre, whether the superficies pressed be
parallel to the horizon, or perpendicular, or oblique; or whether
the fluid, continued upwards from the compressed superficies, rises
perpendicularly in a rectilinear direction, or creeps obliquely through
crooked cavities and canals, whether those passages be regular or
irregular, wide or narrow. That the pressure is not altered by any of
these circumstances, may be collected by applying the demonstration of
this Theorem to the several cases of fluids.</p>

<p>COR. 3. From the same demonstration it may also be collected (by
Prop. XIX), that the parts of a heavy fluid acquire no motion among
themselves by the pressure of the incumbent weight, except that motion
which arises from condensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>COR. 4. And therefore if another body of the same specific gravity,
incapable of condensation, be immersed in this fluid, it will acquire
no motion by the pressure of the incumbent weight: it will neither
descend nor ascend, nor change its figure. If it be spherical, it will
remain so, notwithstanding the pressure; if it be square, it will
remain square; and that, whether it be soft or fluid; whether it swims
freely in the fluid, or lies at the bottom. For any internal part of
a fluid is in the same state with the submersed body; and the case of
all submersed bodies that have the same magnitude, figure, and specific
gravity, is alike. If a submersed body, retaining its weight, should
dissolve and put on the form of a fluid, this body, if before it would
have ascended, descended, or from any pressure assume a new figure,
would now likewise ascend, descend, or put on a new figure; and that,
because its gravity and the other causes of its motion remain. But (by
Case 5, Prop. XIX) it would now be at rest, and retain its figure.
Therefore also in the former case.</p>

<p>COR. 5. Therefore a body that is specifically heavier than a fluid
contiguous to it will sink; and that which is specifically lighter will
ascend, and attain so much motion and change of figure as that excess
or defect of gravity is able to produce. For that excess or defect
is the same thing as an impulse, by which a body, otherwise <i>in
equilibrio</i> with the parts of the fluid, is acted on; and may be
compared with the excess or defect of a weight in one of the scales of
a balance.</p>

<p>COR. 6. Therefore bodies placed in fluids have a twofold gravity; the
one true and absolute, the other apparent, vulgar, and comparative.
Absolute gravity is the whole force with which the body tends
downwards; relative and vulgar gravity is the excess of gravity with
which the body tends downwards more than the ambient fluid. By the
first kind of gravity the parts of all fluids and bodies gravitate in
their proper places; and therefore their weights taken together compose
the weight of the whole. For the whole taken together is heavy, as may
be experienced in vessels full of liquor; and the weight of the whole
is equal to the weights of all the parts, and is therefore composed of
them. By the other kind of gravity bodies do not gravitate in their
places; that is, compared with one another, they do not preponderate,
but, hindering one another's endeavours to descend, remain in their
proper places, as if they were not heavy. Those things which are in
the air, and do not preponderate, are commonly looked on as not heavy.
Those which do preponderate are commonly reckoned heavy, in as much as
they are not sustained by the weight of the air. The common weights
are nothing else but the excess of the true weights above the weight
of the air. Hence also, vulgarly, those things are called light which
are less heavy, and, by yielding to the preponderating air, mount
upwards. But these are only comparatively light and not truly so,
because they descend <i>in vacuo</i>. Thus, in water, bodies which, by
their greater or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span> less gravity, descend or ascend, are comparatively
and apparently heavy or light; and their comparative and apparent
gravity or levity is the excess or defect by which their true gravity
either exceeds the gravity of the water or is exceeded by it. But those
things which neither by preponderating descend, nor, by yielding to the
preponderating fluid, ascend, although by their true weight they do
increase the weight of the whole, yet comparatively, and in the sense
of the vulgar, they do not gravitate in the water. For these cases are
alike demonstrated.</p>

<p>COR. 7. These things which have been demonstrated concerning gravity
take place in any other centripetal forces.</p>

<p>COR. 8. Therefore if the medium in which any body moves be acted on
either by its own gravity, or by any other centripetal force, and the
body be urged more powerfully by the same force; the difference of the
forces is that very motive force, which, in the foregoing Propositions,
I have considered as a centripetal force. But if the body be more
lightly urged by that force, the difference of the forces becomes a
centrifugal force, and is to be considered as such.</p>

<p>COR. 9. But since fluids by pressing the included bodies do not change
their external figures, it appears also (by Cor. Prop. XIX) that they
will not change the situation of their internal parts in relation to
one another; and therefore if animals were immersed therein, and that
all sensation did arise from the motion of their parts, the fluid will
neither hurt the immersed bodies, nor excite any sensation, unless so
far as those bodies may be condensed by the compression. And the case
is the same of any system of bodies encompassed with a compressing
fluid. All the parts of the system will be agitated with the same
motions as if they were placed in a vacuum, and would only retain their
comparative gravity; unless so far as the fluid may somewhat resist
their motions, or be requisite to conglutinate them by compression.</p>

steps. And these gravities drawn into the altitudes AB, BC, CD, &amp;c.,
will give the pressures AH, BI, CK, &amp;c., by which the bottom ATV is
acted on (by Theor. XV). Therefore the particle A sustains all the
pressures AH, BI, CK, DL, &amp;c., proceeding <i>in infinitum</i>; and the
particle B sustains the pressures of all but the first AH; and the

be in a geometrical progression as Dr. <i>Halley</i> has found. If
the gravity be as the distance, and the squares of the distances be
in arithmetical progression, the densities will be in geometrical
progression. And so <i>in infinitum</i>. These things will be so, when
the density of the fluid condensed by compression is as the force of
compression; or, which is the same thing, when the space possessed by
the fluid is reciprocally as this force. Other laws of condensation
may be supposed, as that the cube of the compressing force may be as
the biquadrate of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span> density; or the triplicate ratio of the force
the same with the quadruplicate ratio of the density: in which case,
if the gravity be reciprocally as the square of the distance from the
centre, the density will be reciprocally as the cube of the distance.
Suppose that the cube of the compressing force be as the quadrato-cube
of the density; and if the gravity be reciprocally as the square of the
distance, the density will be reciprocally in a sesquiplicate ratio of
the distance. Suppose the compressing force to be in a duplicate ratio
of the density, and the gravity reciprocally in a duplicate ratio of
the distance, and the density will be reciprocally as the distance. To
run over all the cases that might be offered would be tedious. But as
to our own air, this is certain from experiment, that its density is
either accurately, or very nearly at least, as the compressing force;
and therefore the density of the air in the atmosphere of the earth is
as the weight of the whole incumbent air, that is, as the height of the
mercury in the barometer.</p>

<p>Let the fluid be supposed to be included in a cubic space ACE, and then
to be reduced by compression into a lesser cubic space <i>ace</i>; and
the distances of the particles retaining a like situation with respect
to each other in both the spaces, will be as the sides AB, <i>ab</i>
of the cubes; and the densities of the mediums will be reciprocally
as the containing spaces AB<sup>3</sup>, <i>ab<sup>3</sup></i>. In the plane side of the
greater cube ABCD take the square DP equal to the plane side <i>db</i>
of the lesser cube: and, by the supposition, the pressure with which
the square DP urges the inclosed fluid will be to the pressure with
which that square <i>db</i> urges the inclosed fluid as the densities
of the mediums are to each other, that is, as <i>ab<sup>3</sup></i> to AB<sup>3</sup>.
But the pressure with which the square DB urges the included fluid is
to the pressure with which the square DP urges the same fluid as the
square DB to the square DP, that is, as AB<sup>2</sup> to <i>ab<sup>2</sup></i>. Therefore,
<i>ex æquo</i>, the pressure with which the square DB urges the fluid
is to the pressure with which the square <i>db</i> urges the fluid as
<i>ab</i> to AB. Let the planes FGH, <i>fgh</i>, be drawn through the
middles of the two cubes, and divide the fluid into two parts. These
parts will press each other mutually with the same forces with which
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span> are themselves pressed by the planes AC, <i>ac</i>, that is,
in the proportion of <i>ab</i> to AB: and therefore the centrifugal
forces by which these pressures are sustained are in the same ratio.
The number of the particles being equal, and the situation alike, in
both cubes, the forces which all the particles exert, according to the
planes FGH, <i>fgh</i>, upon all, are as the forces which each exerts
on each. Therefore the forces which each exerts on each, according
to the plane FGH in the greater cube, are to the forces which each
exerts on each, according to the plane <i>fgh</i> in the lesser cube,
as <i>ab</i> to AB, that is, reciprocally as the distances of the
particles from each other. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>And, <i>vice versa</i>, if the forces of the single particles are
reciprocally as the distances, that is, reciprocally as the sides of
the cubes AB, <i>ab</i>; the sums of the forces will be in the same
ratio, and the pressures of the sides DB, <i>db</i> as the sums of
the forces; and the pressure of the square DP to the pressure of the
side DB as <i>ab<sup>2</sup></i> to AB<sup>2</sup>. And, <i>ex æquo</i>, the pressure of
the square DP to the pressure of the side <i>db</i> as <i>ab<sup>3</sup></i> to
AB<sup>3</sup>; that is, the force of compression in the one to the force of
compression in the other as the density in the former to the density in
the latter. Q.E.D.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>By a like reasoning, if the centrifugal forces of the particles are
reciprocally in the duplicate ratio of the distances between the
centres, the cubes of the compressing forces will be as the biquadrates
of the densities. If the centrifugal forces be reciprocally in the
triplicate or quadruplicate ratio of the distances, the cubes of the
compressing forces will be as the quadrato-cubes, or cubo-cubes of
the densities. And universally, if D be put for the distance, and E
for the density of the compressed fluid, and the centrifugal forces
be reciprocally as any power D<sup>n</sup> of the distance, whose index is the
number <i>n</i>, the compressing forces will be as the cube roots of
the power <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{E}^{n + 2}" src="images/617.svg" style="vertical-align: 0; width: 4.733ex; height: 1.887ex;" id="img_images_617.svg">,</span> whose index is the number <i>n</i>
+ 2; and the contrary. All these things are to be understood of
particles whose centrifugal forces terminate in those particles that
are next them, or are diffused not much further. We have an example
of this in magnetical bodies. Their attractive virtue is terminated
nearly in bodies of their own kind that are next them. The virtue of
the magnet is contracted by the interposition of an iron plate, and is
almost terminated at it: for bodies further off are not attracted by
the magnet so much as by the iron plate. If in this manner particles
repel others of their own kind that lie next them, but do not exert
their virtue on the more remote, particles of this kind will compose
such fluids as are treated of in this Proposition. If the virtue of any
particle diffuse itself every way <i>in infinitum</i>, there will be
required a greater force to produce an equal condensation of a greater
quantity of the fluid. But whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span> elastic fluids do really consist
of particles so repelling each other, is a physical question. We have
here demonstrated mathematically the property of fluids consisting of
particles of this kind, that hence philosophers may take occasion to
discuss that question.</p>

<i>Of the motion and resistance of funependulous bodies.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXIV. THEOREM XIX.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The quantities of matter in funependulous bodies, whose centres of
oscillation are equally distant from the centre of suspension, are in a
ratio compounded of the ratio of the weights and the duplicate ratio of
the times of the oscillations in vacuo.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For the velocity which a given force can generate in a given matter
in a given time is as the force and the time directly, and the matter
inversely. The greater the force or the time is, or the less the
matter, the greater velocity will be generated. This is manifest from
the second Law of Motion. Now if pendulums are of the same length, the
motive forces in places equally distant from the perpendicular are as
the weights: and therefore if two bodies by oscillating describe equal
arcs, and those arcs are divided into equal parts; since the times
in which the bodies describe each of the correspondent parts of the
arcs are as the times of the whole oscillations, the velocities in the
correspondent parts of the oscillations will be to each other as the
motive forces and the whole times of the oscillations directly, and
the quantities of matter reciprocally: and therefore the quantities of
matter are as the forces and the times of the oscillations directly and
the velocities reciprocally. But the velocities reciprocally are as the
times, and therefore the times directly and the velocities reciprocally
are as the squares of the times; and therefore the quantities of matter
are as the motive forces and the squares of the times, that is, as the
weights and the squares of the times. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore if the times are equal, the quantities of matter in
each of the bodies are as the weights.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If the weights are equal, the quantities of matter will be as
the squares of the times.</p>

<p>COR. 3. If the quantities of matter are equal, the weights will be
reciprocally as the squares of the times.</p>

<p>COR. 4. Whence since the squares of the times, <i>cæteris paribus</i>,
are as the lengths of the pendulums, therefore if both the times and
quantities of matter are equal, the weights will be as the lengths of
the pendulums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span></p>

<p>COR. 5. And universally, the quantity of matter in the pendulous body
is as the weight and the square of the time directly, and the length of
the pendulum inversely.</p>

<p>COR. 6. But in a non-resisting medium, the quantity of matter in the
pendulous body is as the comparative weight and the square of the time
directly, and the length of the pendulum inversely. For the comparative
weight is the motive force of the body in any heavy medium, as was
shewn above; and therefore does the same thing in such a non-resisting
medium as the absolute weight does in a vacuum.</p>

<p>COR. 7. And hence appears a method both of comparing bodies one among
another, as to the quantity of matter in each; and of comparing the
weights of the same body in different places, to know the variation of
its gravity. And by experiments made with the greatest accuracy, I have
always found the quantity of matter in bodies to be proportional to
their weight.</p>

<p><i>Funependulous bodies that are, in any medium, resisted in the
ratio of the moments of time, and funependulous bodies that move in
a non-resisting medium of the same specific gravity, perform their
oscillations in a cycloid in the same time, and describe proportional
parts of arcs together.</i></p>

</figure>

<p>Let AB be an arc of a cycloid, which a body D, by vibrating in a
non-resisting medium, shall describe in any time. Bisect that arc in
C, so that C may be the lowest point thereof; and the accelerative
force with which the body is urged in any place D, or <i>d</i> or E,
will be as the length of the arc CD, or C<i>d</i>, or CE. Let that
force be expressed by that same arc; and since the resistance is as the
moment of the time, and therefore given, let it be expressed by the
given part CO of the cycloidal arc, and take the arc O<i>d</i> in the
same ratio to the arc CD that the arc OB has to the arc CB: and the
force with which the body in <i>d</i> is urged in a resisting medium,
being the excess of the force C<i>d</i> above the resistance CO, will
be expressed by the arc O<i>d</i>, and will therefore be to the force
with which the body D is urged in a non-resisting medium in the place
D, as the arc O<i>d</i> to the arc CD; and therefore also in the place
B, as the arc OB to the arc CB. Therefore if two bodies D, <i>d</i>
go from the place B, and are urged by these forces; since the forces
at the beginning are as the arc CB and OB, the first velocities and
arcs first described will be in the same ratio. Let those arcs be BD
and B<i>d</i>, and the remaining arcs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span> CD, O<i>d</i>, will be in the
same ratio. Therefore the forces, being proportional to those arcs
CD, O<i>d</i>, will remain in the same ratio as at the beginning, and
therefore the bodies will continue describing together arcs in the same
ratio. Therefore the forces and velocities and the remaining arcs CD,
O<i>d</i>, will be always as the whole arcs CB, OB, and therefore those
remaining arcs will be described together. Therefore the two bodies D
and <i>d</i> will arrive together at the places C and O; that which
moves in the non-resisting medium, at the place C, and the other, in
the resisting medium, at the place O. Now since the velocities in C
and O are as the arcs CB, OB, the arcs which the bodies describe when
they go farther will be in the same ratio. Let those arcs be CE and
O<i>e</i>. The force with which the body D in a non-resisting medium
is retarded in E is as CE, and the force with which the body <i>d</i>
in the resisting medium is retarded in <i>e</i>, is as the sum of the
force C<i>e</i> and the resistance CO, that is, as O<i>e</i>; and
therefore the forces with which the bodies are retarded are as the
arcs CB, OB, proportional to the arcs CE, O<i>e</i>; and therefore the
velocities, retarded in that given ratio, remain in the same given
ratio. Therefore the velocities and the arcs described with those
velocities are always to each other in that given ratio of the arcs
CB and OB; and therefore if the entire arcs AB, <i>a</i>B are taken
in the same ratio, the bodies D and <i>d</i> will describe those
arcs together, and in the places A and a will lose all their motion
together. Therefore the whole oscillations are isochronal, or are
performed in equal times; and any parts of the arcs, as BD, B<i>d</i>,
or BE, B<i>e</i>, that are described together, are proportional to the
whole arcs BA, B<i>a</i>. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. Therefore the swiftest motion in a resisting medium does not fall
upon the lowest point C, but is found in that point O, in which the
whole arc described B<i>a</i>, is bisected. And the body, proceeding
from thence to <i>a</i>, is retarded at the same rate with which it was
accelerated before in its descent from B to O.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXVI. THEOREM XXI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Funependulous bodies, that are resisted in the ratio of the
velocity, have their oscillations in a cycloid isochronal.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For if two bodies, equally distant from their centres of suspension,
describe, in oscillating, unequal arcs, and the velocities in the
correspondent parts of the arcs be to each other as the whole arcs;
the resistances, proportional to the velocities, will be also to each
other as the same arcs. Therefore if these resistances be subducted
from or added to the motive forces arising from gravity which are as
the same arcs, the differences or sums will be to each other in the
same ratio of the arcs; and since the increments and decrements of the
velocities are as these differences or sums, the velocities will be
always as the whole arcs; therefore if the velocities are in any one
case as the whole arcs, they will remain always in the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span> ratio. But
at the beginning of the motion, when the bodies begin to descend and
describe those arcs, the forces, which at that time are proportional to
the arcs, will generate velocities proportional to the arcs. Therefore
the velocities will be always as the whole arcs to be described, and
therefore those arcs will be described in the same time. Q.E.D.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXVII. THEOREM XXII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If funependulous bodies are resisted in the duplicate ratio of their
velocities, the differences between the times of the oscillations in a
resisting medium, and the times of the oscillations in a non-resisting
medium of the same specific gravity, will be proportional to the arcs
described in oscillating nearly.</i></p>

<img alt="If funependulous bodies face resistance proportional to the square of their velocities, the time differences from non-resisting cases scale with arc length." height="134" src="images/i_306.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_306.jpg">
</figure>

<p>For let equal pendulums in a resisting medium describe the unequal
arcs A, B; and the resistance of the body in the arc A will be to the
resistance of the body in the correspondent part of the arc B in the
duplicate ratio of the velocities, that is, as AA to BB nearly. If the
resistance in the arc B were to the resistance in the arc A as AB to
AA, the times in the arcs A and B would be equal (by the last Prop.).
Therefore the resistance AA in the arc A, or AB in the arc B, causes
the excess of the time in the arc A above the time in a non-resisting
medium; and the resistance BB causes the excess of the time in the arc
B above the time in a non-resisting medium. But those excesses are as
the efficient forces AB and BB nearly, that is, as the arcs A and B.
Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence from the times of the oscillations in unequal arcs in
a resisting medium, may be known the times of the oscillations in a
non-resisting medium of the same specific gravity. For the difference
of the times will be to the excess of the time in the lesser arc above
the time in a non-resisting medium as the difference of the arcs to the
lesser arc.</p>

<p>COR. 2. The shorter oscillations are more isochronal, and very short
ones are performed nearly in the same times as in a non-resisting
medium. But the times of those which are performed in greater arcs are
a little greater, because the resistance in the descent of the body, by
which the time is prolonged, is greater, in proportion to the length
described in the descent than the resistance in the subsequent ascent,
by which the time is contracted. But the time of the oscillations,
both short and long, seems to be prolonged in some measure by the
motion of the medium. For retarded bodies are resisted somewhat less
in proportion to the velocity, and accelerated bodies somewhat more
than those that proceed uniformly forwards;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span> because the medium, by the
motion it has received from the bodies, going forwards the same way
with them, is more agitated in the former case, and less in the latter;
and so conspires more or less with the bodies moved. Therefore it
resists the pendulums in their descent more, and in their ascent less,
than in proportion to the velocity; and these two causes concurring
prolong the time.</p>

<p>Then if V represent the force arising from the gravity, proportional to
the arc CD to be described, by which the body is acted upon in D, and
R be put for the resistance, V - R will be the whole force with which
the body is urged in D. Therefore the increment of the velocity is as V
- R and the particle of time in which it is generated conjunctly. But
the velocity itself is as the contemporaneous increment of the space
described directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span> and the same particle of time inversely. Therefore,
since the resistance is, by the supposition, as the square of the
velocity, the increment of the resistance will (by Lem. II) be as the
velocity and the increment of the velocity conjunctly, that is, as the
moment of the space and V - R conjunctly; and, therefore, if the moment
of the space be given, as V - R; that is, if for the force V we put its
exponent PIGR, and the resistance R be expressed by any other area Z,
as PIGR - Z.</p>

<p>Therefore the area PIGR uniformly decreasing by the subduction of given
moments, the area Y increases in proportion of PIGR - Y, and the area
Z in proportion of PIGR - Z. And therefore if the areas Y and Z begin
together, and at the beginning are equal, these, by the addition of
equal moments, will continue to be equal; and in like manner decreasing
by equal moments, will vanish together. And, <i>vice versa</i>, if they
together begin and vanish, they will have equal moments and be always
equal; and that, because if the resistance Z be augmented, the velocity
together with the arc C<i>a</i>, described in the ascent of the body,
will be diminished; and the point in which all the motion together with
the resistance ceases coming nearer to the point C, the resistance
vanishes sooner than the area Y. And the contrary will happen when the
resistance is diminished.</p>

Therefore the area <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{OR}}{\mathrm{OQ}}\mathrm{IEF} - \mathrm{IGH}" src="images/618.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.989ex; width: 15.406ex; height: 5.113ex;" id="img_images_618.svg_4">

expressed, and therefore is to the area PINM, by which the gravity is
expressed, as the resistance to the gravity. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore the resistance in the lowest place C is to the force
of gravity as the area <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{OP}}{\mathrm{OQ}}\mathrm{IEF}" src="images/625.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.989ex; width: 8.351ex; height: 5.113ex;" id="img_images_625.svg">
to the area PINM.</p>

<p>COR. 2. But it becomes greatest where the area PIHR is to the area IEF
as OR to OQ. For in that case its moment (that is, PIGR - Y) becomes
nothing.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Hence also may be known the velocity in each place, as being
in the subduplicate ratio of the resistance, and at the beginning of
the motion equal to the velocity of the body oscillating in the same
cycloid without any resistance.</p>

<p>However, by reason of the difficulty of the calculation by which the
resistance and the velocity are found by this Proposition, we have
thought fit to subjoin the Proposition following.</p>

</figure>

<p>Let the arc of the cycloid, described in one entire oscillation, be
expressed by the right line <i>a</i>B, equal to it, and the arc which
would have been described <i>in vacuo</i> by the length AB. Bisect AB
in C, and the point C will represent the lowest point of the cycloid,
and CD will be as the force arising from gravity, with which the body
in D is urged in the direction of the tangent of the cycloid, and will
have the same ratio to the length of the pendulum as the force in D
has to the force of gravity. Let that force, therefore, be expressed
by that length CD, and the force of gravity by the length of the
pendulum; and if in DE you take DK in the same ratio to the length
of the pendulum as the resistance has to the gravity, DK will be the
exponent of the resistance. From the centre C with the interval CA
or CB describe a semi-circle BE<i>e</i>A. Let the body describe, in
the least time, the space D<i>d</i>; and, erecting the perpendiculars
DE, <i>de</i>, meeting the circumference in E and <i>e</i>, they will
be as the velocities which the body descending <i>in vacuo</i> from
the point B would acquire in the places D and <i>d</i>. This appears
by Prop. LII, Book I. Let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span> therefore, these velocities be expressed
by those perpendiculars DE, <i>de</i>; and let DF be the velocity
which it acquires in D by falling from B in the resisting medium.
And if from the centre C with the interval CF we describe the circle
F<i>f</i>M meeting the right lines <i>de</i> and AB in <i>f</i> and
M, then M will be the place to which it would thenceforward, without
farther resistance, ascend, and <i>df</i> the velocity it would acquire
in <i>d</i>. Whence, also, if F<i>g</i> represent the moment of the
velocity which the body D, in describing the least space D<i>d</i>,
loses by the resistance of the medium; and CN be taken equal to
C<i>g</i>; then will N be the place to which the body, if it met no
farther resistance, would thenceforward ascend, and MN will be the
decrement of the ascent arising from the loss of that velocity. Draw
F<i>m</i> perpendicular to <i>df</i>, and the decrement F<i>g</i>
of the velocity DF generated by the resistance DK will be to the
increment <i>fm</i> of the same velocity, generated by the force CD,
as the generating force DK to the generating force CD. But because of
the similar triangles F<i>mf</i>, F<i>hg</i>, FDC, <i>fm</i> is to
F<i>m</i> or D<i>d</i> as CD to DF; and, <i>ex æquo</i>, F<i>g</i> to
D<i>d</i> as DK to DF. Also F<i>h</i> is to F<i>g</i> as DF to CF; and,
<i>ex æquo perturbatè</i>, F<i>h</i> or MN to D<i>d</i> as DK to CF
or CM; and therefore the sum of all the MN × CM will be equal to the
sum of all the D<i>d</i> × DK. At the moveable point M suppose always
a rectangular ordinate erected equal to the indeterminate CM, which
by a continual motion is drawn into the whole length A<i>a</i>; and
the trapezium described by that motion, or its equal, the rectangle
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{A}a \times\, \tfrac{1}{2}a\mathrm B" src="images/626.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 10.631ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_626.svg">,</span> will be equal to the
sum of all the MN × CM, and therefore to the sum of all the D<i>d</i> ×

<p>COR. Hence from the law of resistance, and the difference A<i>a</i>
of the arcs C<i>a</i>, CB, may be collected the proportion of the
resistance to the gravity nearly.</p>

<p>For if the resistance DK be uniform, the figure BKT<i>a</i> will
be a rectangle under B<i>a</i> and DK; and thence the rectangle
under <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{B}a" src="images/627.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.594ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_627.svg"> and A<i>a</i> will be equal to

resistance, and the length of the pendulum the exponent of the gravity,
the resistance will be to the gravity as <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{A}a" src="images/628.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.689ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_628.svg_1">
to the length of the pendulum; altogether as in Prop. XXVIII is
demonstrated.</p>

<p>If the resistance be as the velocity, the figure BKT<i>a</i> will be
nearly an ellipsis. For if a body, in a non-resisting medium, by one
entire oscillation, should describe the length BA, the velocity in any
place D would be as the ordinate DE of the circle described on the
diameter AB. Therefore since B<i>a</i> in the resisting medium, and
BA in the non-resisting one, are described nearly in the same times;
and therefore the velocities in each of the points of B<i>a</i> are
to the velocities in the correspondent points of the length BA nearly
as B<i>a</i> is to BA, the velocity in the point D in the resisting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
medium will be as the ordinate of the circle or ellipsis described upon
the diameter B<i>a</i>; and therefore the figure BKVT<i>a</i> will
be nearly an ellipsis. Since the resistance is supposed proportional
to the velocity, let OV be the exponent of the resistance in the
middle point O; and an ellipsis BRVS<i>a</i> described with the
centre O, and the semi-axes OB, OV, will be nearly equal to the
figure BKVT<i>a</i>, and to its equal the rectangle A<i>a</i> × BO.
Therefore A<i>a</i> × BO is to OV × BO as the area of this ellipsis to
OV × BO; that is, A<i>a</i> is to OV as the area of the semi-circle
to the square of the radius, or as 11 to 7 nearly; and, therefore,
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{7}{11}\mathrm{A}a" src="images/629.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.489ex; height: 2.753ex;" id="img_images_629.svg"> is to the length of the pendulum as the
resistance of the oscillating body in O to its gravity.</p>

<p>Now if the resistance DK be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity,
the figure BKVT<i>a</i> will be almost a parabola having V for its
vertex and OV for its axis, and therefore will be nearly equal to the
rectangle under <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{2}{3}\mathrm{B}a" src="images/630.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.594ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_630.svg"> and OV. Therefore the
rectangle under <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{B}a" src="images/627.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.594ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_627.svg_1"> and A<i>a</i> is equal to
the rectangle <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{2}{3}\mathrm{B}a \times\, \mathrm{OV}" src="images/631.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 11.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_631.svg">,</span> and
therefore OV is equal to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{3}{4}\mathrm{A}a" src="images/632.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.689ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_632.svg">;</span> and therefore
the resistance in O made to the oscillating body is to its gravity as
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{3}{4}\mathrm{A}a" src="images/632.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.689ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_632.svg_1"> to the length of the pendulum.</p>

<p>And I take these conclusions to be accurate enough for practical uses.
For since an ellipsis or parabola BRVS<i>a</i> falls in with the figure
BKVT<i>a</i> in the middle point V, that figure, if greater towards the
part BRV or VS<i>a</i> than the other, is less towards the contrary
part, and is therefore nearly equal to it.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXXI. THEOREM XXV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>If the resistance made to an oscillating body in each of the
proportional parts of the arcs described be augmented or diminished in
a given ratio, the difference between the arc described in the descent

<p>For that difference arises from the retardation of the pendulum by the
resistance of the medium, and therefore is as the whole retardation
and the retarding resistance proportional thereto. In the foregoing
Proposition the rectangle under the right line <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}a \mathrm B" src="images/633.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.594ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_633.svg">
and the difference A<i>a</i> of the arcs CB, C<i>a</i>, was equal
to the area BKT<i>a</i>. And that area, if the length <i>a</i>B
remains, is augmented or diminished in the ratio of the ordinates DK;
that is, in the ratio of the resistance and is therefore as the length
<i>a</i>B and the resistance conjunctly. And therefore the rectangle

Q.E.D.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if the resistance be as the velocity, the difference of
the arcs in the same medium will be as the whole arc described: and the
contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If the resistance be in the duplicate ratio of the velocity,
that difference will be in the duplicate ratio of the whole arc: and
the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 3. And universally, if the resistance be in the triplicate or any
other ratio of the velocity, the difference will be in the same ratio
of the whole arc: and the contrary.</p>

<p>COR. 4. If the resistance be partly in the simple ratio of the
velocity, and partly in the duplicate ratio of the same, the difference
will be partly in the ratio of the whole arc, and partly in the
duplicate ratio of it: and the contrary. So that the law and ratio of
the resistance will be the same for the velocity as the law and ratio
of that difference for the length of the arc.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And therefore if a pendulum describe successively unequal
arcs, and we can find the ratio of the increment or decrement of this
difference for the length of the arc described, there will be had also
the ratio of the increment or decrement of the resistance for a greater
or less velocity.</p>

<p>From these propositions we may find the resistance of mediums by

to the length of the pendulum between the centre of suspension and the
ruler, that is, to 121 inches. Therefore since V in the second case
represents 1, in the 4th case 4, and in the 6th case 16, the resistance
will be to the weight of the globe, in the 2d case, as 0,0030345 to
121; in the 4th, as 0,041748 to 121; in the 6th, as 0,61705 to 121.</p>

<p>The arc, which the point marked in the thread described in
the 6th case, was of <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="120 - \dfrac{8}{9\tfrac{2}{3}}" src="images/659.svg" style="vertical-align: -2.682ex; width: 10.081ex; height: 5.718ex;" id="img_images_659.svg">,</span> or

inches, and the length of the pendulum between the point of suspension
and the centre of the globe was 126 inches, the arc which the centre
of the globe described was <img alt="" data-tex="124\tfrac{3}{31}" src="images/661.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_661.svg"> inches. Because the
greatest velocity of the oscillating body, by reason of the resistance
of the air, does not fall on the lowest point of the arc described, but
near the middle place of the whole arc, this velocity will be nearly
the same as if the globe in its whole descent in a non-resisting medium
should describe <img alt="" data-tex="62\tfrac{3}{62}" src="images/662.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_662.svg"> inches, the half of that arc, and
that in a cycloid, to which we have above reduced the motion of the
pendulum; and therefore that velocity will be equal to that which the
globe would acquire by falling perpendicularly from a height equal to
the versed sine of that arc. But that versed sine in the cycloid is
to that arc <img alt="" data-tex="62\tfrac{3}{62}" src="images/662.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_662.svg_1"> as the same arc to twice the length
of the pendulum 252, and therefore equal to 15,278 inches. Therefore
the velocity of the pendulum is the same which a body would acquire by
falling, and in its fall describing a space of 15,278 inches. Therefore
with such a velocity the globe meets with a resistance which is to
its weight as 0,61705 to 121, or (if we take that part only of the
resistance which is in the duplicate ratio of the velocity) as 0,56752
to 121.</p>

<p>I found, by an hydrostatical experiment, that the weight of this wooden
globe was to the weight of a globe of water of the same magnitude
as 55 to 97: and therefore since 121 is to 213,4 in the same ratio,
the resistance made to this globe of water, moving forwards with the
above-mentioned velocity, will be to its weight as 0,56752 to 213,4,
that is, as 1 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="376\tfrac{1}{50}" src="images/663.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_663.svg">.</span> Whence since the weight of
a globe of water, in the time in which the globe with a velocity

1,5295 inches. And this difference multiplied into the weight of the
pendulous globe, which was 208 ounces, produces 318,136. Again; in the
pendulum above-mentioned, made of a wooden globe, when its centre of
oscillation, being 126 inches from the point of suspension, described
the whole arc of <img alt="" data-tex="124\tfrac{3}{31}" src="images/661.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_661.svg_3"> inches, the difference of the
arcs described in the descent and ascent was <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{126}{121}" src="images/694.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 4.389ex; height: 4.588ex;" id="img_images_694.svg">
into <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{8}{9\tfrac{3}{2}}" src="images/695.svg" style="vertical-align: -2.645ex; width: 3.922ex; height: 5.682ex;" id="img_images_695.svg">.</span> This multiplied into the weight
of the globe, which was <img alt="" data-tex="57\tfrac{7}{22}" src="images/634.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.753ex;" id="img_images_634.svg_3"> ounces, produces 49,396.
But I multiply these differences into the weights of the globes, in
order to find their resistances. For the differences arise from the
resistances, and are as the resistances directly and the weights
inversely. Therefore the resistances are as the numbers 318,136 and
49,396. But that part of the resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span> of the lesser globe, which is
in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, was to the whole resistance as
0,56752 to 0,61675, that is, as 45,453 to 49,396; whereas that part
of the resistance of the greater globe is almost equal to its whole
resistance; and so those parts are nearly as 318,136 and 45,453, that
is, as 7 and 1. But the diameters of the globes are <img alt="" data-tex="18\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/688.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_688.svg_1">
and <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{7}{8}" src="images/635.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_635.svg_2">;</span> and their squares <img alt="" data-tex="351\tfrac{9}{16}" src="images/696.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_696.svg"> and
<img alt="" data-tex="47\tfrac{17}{64}" src="images/697.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_697.svg"> are as 7,438 and 1, that is, as the resistances of
the globes 7 and 1, nearly. The difference of these ratios is scarce
greater than may arise from the resistance of the thread. Therefore
those parts of the resistances which are, when the globes are equal, as
the squares of the velocities, are also, when the velocities are equal,
as the squares of the diameters of the globes.</p>

<p>But the greatest of the globes I used in these experiments was not
perfectly spherical, and therefore in this calculation I have, for
brevity's sake, neglected some little niceties; being not very
solicitous for an accurate calculus in an experiment that was not
very accurate. So that I could wish that these experiments were tried
again with other globes, of a larger size, more in number, and more
accurately formed; since the demonstration of a vacuum depends thereon.
If the globes be taken in a geometrical proportion, as suppose whose
diameters are 4, 8, 16, 32 inches; one may collect from the progression
observed in the experiments what would happen if the globes were still
larger.</p>

<p>In order to compare the resistances of different fluids with each
other, I made the following trials. I procured a wooden vessel 4 feet
long, 1 foot broad, and 1 foot high. This vessel, being uncovered,
I filled with spring water, and, having immersed pendulums therein,
I made them oscillate in the water. And I found that a leaden globe
weighing <img alt="" data-tex="166\tfrac{1}{6}" src="images/698.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_698.svg"> ounces, and in diameter <img alt="" data-tex="3\tfrac{5}{8}" src="images/699.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_699.svg">
inches, moved therein as it is set down in the following table; the
length of the pendulum from the point of suspension to a certain point
marked in the thread being 126 inches, and to the centre of oscillation

<p>In the experiments of the 4th column there were equal motions lost in
535 oscillations made in the air, and <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/714.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_714.svg"> in water. The
oscillations in the air were indeed a little swifter than those in the
water. But if the oscillations in the water were accelerated in such
a ratio that the motions of the pendulums might be equally swift in
both mediums, there would be still the same number <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/714.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_714.svg_1">
of oscillations in the water, and by these the same quantity of motion
would be lost as before; because the resistance is increased, and
the square of the time diminished in the same duplicate ratio. The
pendulums, therefore, being of equal velocities, there were equal
motions lost in 535 oscillations in the air, and  <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/714.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_714.svg_2"> in the water;

Therefore in the case of the 4th column, where the velocity

the resistance of the pendulum in water is to that part of the
resistance in air, which is proportional to the square of the
velocity, and which in swift motions is the only part that deserves
consideration, as 61<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{12}{17}" src="images/723.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_723.svg_1"> to 48<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{9}{56}" src="images/724.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_724.svg_1"> and 535

thread of the pendulum oscillating in the water had been immersed,
its resistance would have been still greater; so that the resistance
of the pendulum oscillating in the water, that is, that part which is
proportional to the square of the velocity, and which only needs to
be considered in swift bodies, is to the resistance of the same whole
pendulum, oscillating in air with the same velocity, as about 850 to 1,
that is as, the density of water to the density of air, nearly.</p>

<p>In this calculation we ought also to have taken in that part of the
resistance of the pendulum in the water which was as the square of
the velocity; but I found (which will perhaps seem strange) that the
resistance in the water was augmented in more than a duplicate ratio of
the velocity. In searching after the cause, I thought upon this, that
the vessel was too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span> narrow for the magnitude of the pendulous globe,
and by its narrowness obstructed the motion of the water as it yielded
to the oscillating globe. For when I immersed a pendulous globe, whose
diameter was one inch only, the resistance was augmented nearly in a
duplicate ratio of the velocity. I tried this by making a pendulum of
two globes, of which the lesser and lower oscillated in the water, and
the greater and higher was fastened to the thread just above the water,
and, by oscillating in the air, assisted the motion of the pendulum,
and continued it longer. The experiments made by this contrivance
proved according to the following table.</p>

<p>In comparing the resistances of the mediums with each other, I also
caused iron pendulums to oscillate in quicksilver. The length of
the iron wire was about 3 feet, and the diameter of the pendulous
globe about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/227.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_227.svg_1"> of an inch. To the wire, just above
the quicksilver, there was fixed another leaden globe of a bigness
sufficient to continue the motion of the pendulum for some time. Then
a vessel, that would hold about 3 pounds of quicksilver, was filled by
turns with quicksilver and common water, that, by making the pendulum
oscillate successively in these two different fluids, I might find the
proportion of their resistances; and the resistance of the quicksilver
proved to be to the resistance of water as about 13 or 14 to 1; that
is, as the density of quicksilver to the density of water. When I made
use of a pendulous globe something bigger, as of one whose diameter was
about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/643.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_643.svg_11"> or <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/226.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_226.svg_1"> of an inch, the resistance
of the quicksilver proved to be to the resistance of the water as
about 12 or 10 to 1. But the former experiment is more to be relied
on, because in the latter the vessel was too narrow in proportion to
the magnitude of the immersed globe; for the vessel ought to have
been enlarged together with the globe. I intended to have repeated
these experiments with larger vessels, and in melted metals, and other
liquors both cold and hot; but I had not leisure to try all: and
besides, from what is already described, it appears sufficiently that
the resistance of bodies moving swiftly is nearly proportional to the
densities of the fluids in which they move. I do not say accurately;
for more tenacious fluids, of equal density, will undoubtedly resist
more than those that are more liquid; as cold oil more than warm, warm
oil more than rain-water, and water more than spirit of wine. But in
liquors, which are sensibly fluid enough, as in air, in salt and fresh
water, in spirit of wine, of turpentine, and salts, in oil cleared
of its fæces by distillation and warmed, in oil of vitriol, and in
mercury, and melted metals, and any other such like, that are fluid
enough to retain for some time the motion impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span> upon them by the
agitation of the vessel, and which being poured out are easily resolved
into drops, I doubt not but the rule already laid down may be accurate
enough, especially if the experiments be made with larger pendulous
bodies and more swiftly moved.</p>

<p>Lastly, since it is the opinion of some that there is a certain
æthereal medium extremely rare and subtile, which freely pervades the
pores of all bodies; and from such a medium, so pervading the pores of
bodies, some resistance must needs arise; in order to try whether the
resistance, which we experience in bodies in motion, be made upon their
outward superficies only, or whether their internal parts meet with
any considerable resistance upon their superficies, I thought of the
following experiment I suspended a round deal box by a thread 11 feet
long, on a steel hook, by means of a ring of the same metal, so as to
make a pendulum of the aforesaid length. The hook had a sharp hollow
edge on its upper part, so that the upper arc of the ring pressing on
the edge might move the more freely; and the thread was fastened to
the lower arc of the ring. The pendulum being thus prepared, I drew
it aside from the perpendicular to the distance of about 6 feet, and
that in a plane perpendicular to the edge of the hook, lest the ring,
while the pendulum oscillated, should slide to and fro on the edge of
the hook: for the point of suspension, in which the ring touches the
hook, ought to remain immovable. I therefore accurately noted the place
to which the pendulum was brought, and letting it go, I marked three
other places, to which it returned at the end of the 1st, 2d, and 3d
oscillation. This I often repeated, that I might find those places
as accurately as possible. Then I filled the box with lead and other
heavy metals that were near at hand. But, first, I weighed the box
when empty, and that part of the thread that went round it, and half
the remaining part, extended between the hook and the suspended box;
for the thread so extended always acts upon the pendulum, when drawn
aside from the perpendicular, with half its weight. To this weight I
added the weight of the air contained in the box. And this whole weight
was about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{78}" src="images/731.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_731.svg"> of the weight of the box when filled with
the metals. Then because the box when full of the metals, by extending
the thread with its weight, increased the length of the pendulum, I
shortened the thread so as to make the length of the pendulum, when
oscillating, the same as before. Then drawing aside the pendulum to the
place first marked, and letting it go, I reckoned about 77 oscillations
before the box returned to the second mark, and as many afterwards
before it came to the third mark, and as many after that before it came
to the fourth mark. From whence I conclude that the whole resistance
of the box, when full, had not a greater proportion to the resistance
of the box, when empty, than 78 to 77. For if their resistances were
equal, the box, when full, by reason of its <i>vis insita</i>, which
was 78 times greater than the <i>vis insita</i> of the same when
empty, ought to have continued its oscillating motion so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span> much the
longer, and therefore to have returned to those marks at the end of 78
oscillations. But it returned to them at the end of 77 oscillations.</p>

<p>Let, therefore, A represent the resistance of the box upon its external
superficies, and B the resistance of the empty box on its internal
superficies; and if the resistances to the internal parts of bodies
equally swift be as the matter, or the number of particles that are
resisted, then 78B will be the resistance made to the internal parts
of the box, when full; and therefore the whole resistance A + B of the
empty box will be to the whole resistance A + 78B of the full box as 77
to 78, and, by division, A + B to 77B as 77 to 1; and thence A + B to B
as 77 × 77 to 1, and, by division again, A to B as 5928 to 1. Therefore
the resistance of the empty box in its internal parts will be above
5000 times less than the resistance on its external superficies. This
reasoning depends upon the supposition that the greater resistance of
the full box arises not from any other latent cause, but only from the
action of some subtile fluid upon the included metal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span></p>

<p>This experiment is related by memory, the paper being lost in which I
had described it; so that I have been obliged to omit some fractional
parts, which are split out of my memory; and I have no leisure to try
it again. The first time I made it, the hook being weak, the full box
was retarded sooner. The cause I found to be, that the hook was not
strong enough to bear the weight of the box; so that, as it oscillated
to and fro, the hook was bent sometimes this and sometimes that way.
I therefore procured a hook of sufficient strength, so that the point
of suspension might remain unmoved, and then all things happened as is
above described.</p>

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXXII. THEOREM XXVI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Suppose two similar systems of bodies consisting of an equal number
of particles, and let the correspondent particles be similar and
proportional, each in one system to each in the other, and have a like
situation among themselves, and the same given ratio of density to each
other; and let them begin to move among themselves in proportional
times, and with like motions (that is, those in one system among
one another, and those in the other among one another). And if the
particles that are in the same system do not touch one another, except
in the moments of reflexion; nor attract, nor repel each other, except
with accelerative forces that are as the diameters of the correspondent
particles inversely, and the squares of the velocities directly; I
say, that the particles of those systems will continue to move among
themselves with like motions and in proportional times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Like bodies in like situations are said to be moved among themselves
with like motions and in proportional times, when their situations
at the end of those times are always found alike in respect of
each other; as suppose we compare the particles in one system with
the correspondent particles in the other. Hence the times will be
proportional, in which similar and proportional parts of similar
figures will be described by correspondent particles. Therefore if
we suppose two systems of this kind, the correspondent particles,
by reason of the similitude of the motions at their beginning, will
continue to be moved with like motions, so long as they move without
meeting one another; for if they are acted on by no forces, they will
go on uniformly in right lines, by the 1st Law. But if they do agitate
one another with some certain forces, and those forces are as the
diameters of the correspondent particles inversely and the squares
of the velocities directly, then, because the particles are in like
situations, and their forces are proportional, the whole forces with
which correspondent particles are agitated, and which are compounded
of each of the agitating forces (by Corol. 2 of the Laws), will have
like directions, and have the same effect as if they respected centres
placed alike among the particles; and those whole forces will be to
each other as the several forces which compose them, that is, as the
diameters of the correspondent particles inversely, and the squares
of the velocities directly: and therefore will cause<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span> correspondent
particles to continue to describe like figures. These things will be so
(by Cor. 1 and 8, Prop. IV., Book I), if those centres are at rest but
if they are moved, yet by reason of the similitude of the translations,
their situations among the particles of the system will remain similar,
so that the changes introduced into the figures described by the
particles will still be similar. So that the motions of correspondent
and similar particles will continue similar till their first meeting
with each other; and thence will arise similar collisions, and similar
reflexions; which will again beget similar motions of the particles
among themselves (by what was just now shown), till they mutually fall
upon one another again, and so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if any two bodies, which are similar and in like
situations to the correspondent particles of the systems, begin to
move amongst them in like manner and in proportional times, and their
magnitudes and densities be to each other as the magnitudes and
densities of the corresponding particles, these bodies will continue to
be moved in like manner and in proportional times; for the case of the
greater parts of both systems and of the particles is the very same.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And if all the similar and similarly situated parts of both
systems be at rest among themselves; and two of them, which are greater
than the rest, and mutually correspondent in both systems, begin to
move in lines alike posited, with any similar motion whatsoever, they
will excite similar motions in the rest of the parts of the systems,
and will continue to move among those parts in like manner and in
proportional times; and will therefore describe spaces proportional to
their diameters.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXXIII. THEOREM XXVII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The same things being supposed, I say, that the greater parts of the
systems are resisted in a ratio compounded of the duplicate ratio of
their velocities, and the duplicate ratio of their diameters, and the
simple ratio of the density of the parts of the systems.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For the resistance arises partly from the centripetal or centrifugal
forces with which the particles of the system mutually act on each
other, partly from the collisions and reflexions of the particles and
the greater parts. The resistances of the first kind are to each other
as the whole motive forces from which they arise, that is, as the whole
accelerative forces and the quantities of matter in corresponding
parts; that is (by the supposition), as the squares of the velocities
directly, and the distances of the corresponding particles inversely,
and the quantities of matter in the correspondent parts directly:
and therefore since the distances of the particles in one system are
to the correspondent distances of the particles of the other as the
diameter of one particle or part in the former system to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span> diameter
of the correspondent particle or part in the other, and since the
quantities of matter are as the densities of the parts and the cubes
of the diameters; the resistances are to each other as the squares
of the velocities and the squares of the diameters and the densities
of the parts of the systems. Q.E.D. The resistances of the latter
sort are as the number of correspondent reflexions and the forces of
those reflexions conjunctly; but the number of the reflexions are to
each other as the velocities of the corresponding parts directly and
the spaces between their reflexions inversely. And the forces of the
reflexions are as the velocities and the magnitudes and the densities
of the corresponding parts conjunctly; that is, as the velocities and
the cubes of the diameters and the densities of the parts. And, joining
all these ratios, the resistances of the corresponding parts are to
each other as the squares of the velocities and the squares of the
diameters and the densities of the parts conjunctly. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore if those systems are two elastic fluids, like our
air, and their parts are at rest among themselves; and two similar
bodies proportional in magnitude and density to the parts of the
fluids, and similarly situated among those parts, be any how projected
in the direction of lines similarly posited; and the accelerative
forces with which the particles of the fluids mutually act upon each
other are as the diameters of the bodies projected inversely and the
squares of their velocities directly; those bodies will excite similar
motions in the fluids in proportional times, and will describe similar
spaces and proportional to their diameters.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Therefore in the same fluid a projected body that moves
swiftly meets with a resistance that is, in the duplicate ratio of its
velocity, nearly. For if the forces with which distant particles act
mutually upon one another should be augmented in the duplicate ratio
of the velocity, the projected body would be resisted in the same
duplicate ratio accurately; and therefore in a medium, whose parts when
at a distance do not act mutually with any force on one another, the
resistance is in the duplicate ratio of the velocity accurately. Let
there be, therefore, three mediums A, B, C, consisting of similar and
equal parts regularly disposed at equal distances. Let the parts of
the mediums A and B recede from each other with forces that are among
themselves as T and V; and let the parts of the medium C be entirely
destitute of any such forces. And if four equal bodies D, E, F, G, move
in these mediums, the two first D and E in the two first A and B, and
the other two F and G in the third C; and if the velocity of the body
D be to the velocity of the body E, and the velocity of the body F to
the velocity of the body G, in the subduplicate ratio of the force T
to the force V; the resistance of the body D to the resistance of the
body E, and the resistance of the body F to the resistance of the body
G, will be in the duplicate ratio of the velocities; and therefore
the resistance of the body D will be to the resistance of the body
F as the resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span> of the body E to the resistance of the body G.
Let the bodies D and F be equally swift, as also the bodies E and G;
and, augmenting the velocities of the bodies D and F in any ratio,
and diminishing the forces of the particles of the medium B in the
duplicate of the same ratio, the medium B will approach to the form and
condition of the medium C at pleasure; and therefore the resistances
of the equal and equally swift bodies E and G in these mediums will
perpetually approach to equality so that their difference will at last
become less than any given. Therefore since the resistances of the
bodies D and F are to each other as the resistances of the bodies E and
G, those will also in like manner approach to the ratio of equality.
Therefore the bodies D and F, when they move with very great swiftness,
meet with resistances very nearly equal; and therefore since the
resistance of the body F is in a duplicate ratio of the velocity, the
resistance of the body D will be nearly in the same ratio.</p>

<p>COR. 3. The resistance of a body moving very swift in an elastic fluid
is almost the same as if the parts of the fluid were destitute of their
centrifugal forces, and did not fly from each other; if so be that
the elasticity of the fluid arise from the centrifugal forces of the
particles, and the velocity be so great as not to allow the particles
time enough to act.</p>

<p>COR. 4. Therefore, since the resistances of similar and equally swift
bodies, in a medium whose distant parts do not fly from each other, are
as the squares of the diameters, the resistances made to bodies moving
with very great and equal velocities in an elastic fluid will be as the
squares of the diameters, nearly.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And since similar, equal, and equally swift bodies, moving
through mediums of the same density, whose particles do not fly from
each other mutually, will strike against an equal quantity of matter in
equal times, whether the particles of which the medium consists be more
and smaller, or fewer and greater, and therefore impress on that matter
an equal quantity of motion, and in return (by the 3d Law of Motion)
suffer an equal re-action from the same, that is, are equally resisted;
it is manifest, also, that in elastic fluids of the same density, when
the bodies move with extreme swiftness, their resistances are nearly
equal, whether the fluids consist of gross parts, or of parts ever so
subtile. For the resistance of projectiles moving with exceedingly
great celerities is not much diminished by the subtilty of the medium.</p>

<p>COR. 6. All these things are so in fluids whose elastic force takes its
rise from the centrifugal forces of the particles. But if that force
arise from some other cause, as from the expansion of the particles
after the manner of wool, or the boughs of trees, or any other
cause, by which the particles are hindered from moving freely among
themselves, the resistance, by reason of the lesser fluidity of the
medium, will be greater than in the Corollaries above.</p>

<p><i>If in a rare medium, consisting of equal particles freely disposed

as that of the cylinder.</i></p>

</figure>

<p>For since the action of the medium upon the body is the same (by Cor.
5 of the Laws) whether the body move in a quiescent medium, or whether
the particles of the medium impinge with the same velocity upon the
quiescent body, let us consider the body as if it were quiescent, and
see with what force it would be impelled by the moving medium. Let,
therefore, ABKI represent a spherical body described from the centre C
with the semi-diameter CA, and let the particles of the medium impinge
with a given velocity upon that spherical body in the directions of
right lines parallel to AC; and let FB be one of those right lines.
In FB take LB equal to the semi-diameter CB, and draw BD touching
the sphere in B. Upon KC and BD let fall the perpendiculars BE, LD;
and the force with which a particle of the medium, impinging on the
globe obliquely in the direction FB, would strike the globe in B, will
be to the force with which the same particle, meeting the cylinder
ONGQ, described about the globe with the axis ACI, would strike it
perpendicularly in <i>b</i>, as LD to LB, or BE to BC. Again; the
efficacy of this force to move the globe, according to the direction
of its incidence FB or AC, is to the efficacy of the same to move the
globe, according to the direction of its determination, that is, in the
direction of the right line BC in which it impels the globe directly,
as BE to BC. And, joining these ratios, the efficacy of a particle,
falling upon the globe obliquely in the direction of the right line FB,
to move the globe in the direction of its incidence, is to the efficacy
of the same particle falling in the same line perpendicularly on the
cylinder, to move it in the same direction, as BE<sup>2</sup> to BC<sup>2</sup>. Therefore
if in <i>b</i>E, which is perpendicular to the circular base of the
cylinder NAO, and equal to the radius AC, we take <i>b</i>H equal to
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{BE}^{2}}{\mathrm{CB}}" src="images/732.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.6ex; width: 5.126ex; height: 5.122ex;" id="img_images_732.svg">;</span> then <i>b</i>H will be to
<i>b</i>E as the effect of the particle upon the globe to the effect of
the particle upon the cylinder. And therefore the solid which is formed
by all the right lines <i>b</i>H will be to the solid formed by all the
right lines <i>b</i>E as the effect of all the particles upon the globe
to the effect of all the particles upon the cylinder. But the former
of these solids is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span> paraboloid whose vertex is C, its axis CA, and
latus rectum CA, and the latter solid is a cylinder circumscribing the
paraboloid; and it is known that a paraboloid is half its circumscribed
cylinder. Therefore the whole force of the medium upon the globe is
half of the entire force of the same upon the cylinder. And therefore
if the particles of the medium are at rest, and the cylinder and globe
move with equal velocities, the resistance of the globe will be half
the resistance of the cylinder. Q.E.D.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>By the same method other figures may be compared together as to their
resistance; and those may be found which are most apt to continue
their motions in resisting mediums. As if upon the circular base
CEBH from the centre O, with the radius OC, and the altitude OD, one
would construct a frustum CBGF of a cone, which should meet with less
resistance than any other frustum constructed with the same base and
altitude, and going forwards towards D in the direction of its axis:
bisect the altitude OD in Q, and produce OQ to S, so that QS may be
equal to QC, and S will be the vertex of the cone whose frustum is
sought.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width500" style="width: 500px;" id="i_328">

<p>Whence, by the bye, since the angle CSB is always acute, it follows,
that, if the solid ADBE be generated by the convolution of an
elliptical or oval figure ADBE about its axis AB, and the generating
figure be touched by three right lines FG, GH, HI, in the points F,
B, and I, so that GH shall be perpendicular to the axis in the point

the cylinder, and since the globe is to the cylinder as 2 to 3, and
since the cylinder by falling perpendicularly on the particles, and
reflecting them with the utmost force, communicates to them a velocity
double to its own; it follows that the cylinder, in moving forward
uniformly half the length of its axis, will communicate a motion to the
particles which is to the whole motion of the cylinder as the density
of the medium to the density of the cylinder; and that the globe, in
the time it describes one length of its diameter in moving uniformly
forward, will communicate the same motion to the particles; and in the
time that it describes two thirds of its diameter, will communicate a
motion to the particles which is to the whole motion of the globe as
the density of the medium to the density of the globe. And therefore
the globe meets with a resistance, which is to the force by which its
whole motion may be either taken away or generated in the time in which
it describes two thirds of its diameter moving uniformly forward, as
the density of the medium to the density of the globe.</p>

<p>CASE 2. Let us suppose that the particles of the medium incident on
the globe or cylinder are not reflected; and then the cylinder falling
perpendicularly on the particles will communicate its own simple
velocity to them, and therefore meets a resistance but half so great as
in the former case, and the globe also meets with a resistance but half
so great.</p>

<p>CASE 3. Let us suppose the particles of the medium to fly back from the
globe with a force which is neither the greatest, nor yet none at all,
but with a certain mean force; then the resistance of the globe will be
in the same mean ratio between the resistance in the first case and the
resistance in the second. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if the globe and the particles are infinitely hard,
and destitute of all elastic force, and therefore of all force of
reflexion; the resistance of the globe will be to the force by which
its whole motion may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span> be destroyed or generated, in the time that the
globe describes four third parts of its diameter, as the density of the
medium to the density of the globe.</p>

<p>COR. 2. The resistance of the globe, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, is in the
duplicate ratio of the velocity.</p>

<p>COR. 3. The resistance of the globe, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, is in the
duplicate ratio of the diameter.</p>

<p>COR. 4. The resistance of the globe is, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, as the
density of the medium.</p>

<p>COR. 5. The resistance of the globe is in a ratio compounded of the
duplicate ratio of the velocity, and the duplicate ratio of the
diameter, and the ratio of the density of the medium.</p>

<p>COR. 6. The motion of the globe and its resistance may be thus
expounded. Let AB be the time in which the globe may, by its resistance
uniformly continued, lose its whole motion. Erect AD, BC perpendicular
to AB. Let BC be that whole motion, and through the point C, the
asymptotes being AD, AB, describe the hyperbola CF. Produce AB to
any point E. Erect the perpendicular EF meeting the hyperbola in F.
Complete the parallelogram CBEG, and draw AF meeting BC in H. Then if
the globe in any time BE, with its first motion BC uniformly continued,
describes in a non-resisting medium the space CBEG expounded by the
area of the parallelogram, the same in a resisting medium will describe
the space CBEF expounded by the area of the hyperbola; and its motion
at the end of that time will be expounded by EF, the ordinate of
the hyperbola, there being lost of its motion the part FG. And its
resistance at the end of the same time will be expounded by the length
BH, there being lost of its resistance the part CH. All these things
appear by Cor. 1 and 3, Prop. V., Book II.</p>

<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>I have exhibited in this Proposition the resistance and retardation
of spherical projectiles in mediums that are not continued, and shewn
that this resistance is to the force by which the whole motion of the
globe may be destroyed or produced in the time in which the globe
can describe two thirds of its diameter, with a velocity uniformly
continued, as the density of the medium to the density of the globe, if
so be the globe and the particles of the medium be perfectly elastic,
and are endued with the utmost force of reflexion; and that this force,
where the globe and particles of the medium are infinitely hard and
void of any reflecting force, is diminished one half. But in continued
mediums, as water, hot oil, and quicksilver, the globe as it passes
through them does not immediately strike against all the particles of
the fluid that generate the resistance made to it, but presses only the
particles that lie next to it, which press the particles beyond, which
press other particles, and so on; and in these mediums the resistance
is diminished one other half. A globe in these extremely fluid mediums
meets with a resistance that is to the force by which its whole motion
may be destroyed or generated in the time wherein it can describe, with
that motion uniformly continued, eight third parts of its diameter, as
the density of the medium to the density of the globe. This I shall
endeavour to shew in what follows.</p>

<p><i>To define the motion of water running out of a cylindrical vessel
through a hole made at the bottom.</i></p>
</div>

<img alt="How to define the motion of water running out of a cylindrical vessel through a hole made at the bottom." height="288" src="images/i_331.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_331.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Let ACDB be a cylindrical vessel, AB the mouth of it, CD the bottom
parallel to the horizon, EF a circular hole in the middle of the
bottom, G the centre of the hole, and GH the axis of the cylinder
perpendicular to the horizon. And suppose a cylinder of ice APQB to
be of the same breadth with the cavity of the vessel, and to have the
same axis, and to descend perpetually with an uniform motion, and that
its parts, as soon as they touch the superficies AB, dissolve into
water, and flow down by their weight into the vessel, and in their
fall compose the cataract or column of water ABNFEM, passing through
the hole EF, and filling up the same exactly. Let the uniform velocity
of the descending ice and of the contiguous water in the circle AB
be that which the water would acquire by falling through the space
IH; and let IH and HG lie in the same right line; and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span> the
point I let there be drawn the right line KL parallel to the horizon
and meeting the ice on both the sides thereof in K and L. Then the
velocity of the water running out at the hole EF will be the same that
it would acquire by falling from I through the space IG. Therefore, by
<i>Galileo's</i> Theorems, IG will be to IH in the duplicate ratio of
the velocity of the water that runs out at the hole to the velocity
of the water in the circle AB, that is, in the duplicate ratio of the
circle AB to the circle EF; those circles being reciprocally as the
velocities of the water which in the same time and in equal quantities
passes severally through each of them, and completely fills them both.
We are now considering the velocity with which the water tends to the
plane of the horizon. But the motion parallel to the same, by which the
parts of the falling water approach to each other, is not here taken
notice of; since it is neither produced by gravity, nor at all changes
the motion perpendicular to the horizon which the gravity produces. We
suppose, indeed, that the parts of the water cohere a little, that by
their cohesion they may in falling approach to each other with motions
parallel to the horizon in order to form one single cataract, and to
prevent their being divided into several: but the motion parallel to
the horizon arising from this cohesion does not come under our present
consideration.</p>

<p>CASE 1. Conceive now the whole cavity in the vessel, which encompasses
the falling water ABNFEM, to be full of ice, so that the water may pass
through the ice as through a funnel. Then if the water pass very near
to the ice only, without touching it; or, which is the same thing, if
by reason of the perfect smoothness of the surface of the ice, the
water, though touching it, glides over it with the utmost freedom, and
without the least resistance; the water will run through the hole EF
with the same velocity as before, and the whole weight of the column
of water ABNFEM will be all taken up as before in forcing out the
water, and the bottom of the vessel will sustain the weight of the ice
encompassing that column.</p>

<p>Let now the ice in the vessel dissolve into water; yet will the efflux
of the water remain, as to its velocity, the same as before. It will
not be less, because the ice now dissolved will endeavour to descend;
it will not be greater, because the ice, now become water, cannot
descend without hindering the descent of other water equal to its own
descent. The same force ought always to generate the same velocity in
the effluent water.</p>

<p>But the hole at the bottom of the vessel, by reason of the oblique
motions of the particles of the effluent water, must be a little
greater than before. For now the particles of the water do not all of
them pass through the hole perpendicularly, but, flowing down on all
parts from the sides of the vessel, and converging towards the hole,
pass through it with oblique motions; and in tending downwards meet
in a stream whose diameter is a little smaller below the hole than at
the hole itself; its diameter being to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span> diameter of the hole as 5
to 6, or as <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/736.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_736.svg"> to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/727.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_727.svg_1">,</span> very nearly, if
I took the measures of those diameters right. I procured a very thin
flat plate, having a hole pierced in the middle, the diameter of the
circular hole being <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{5}{8}" src="images/737.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_737.svg"> parts of an inch. And that the
stream of running waters might not be accelerated in falling, and
by that acceleration become narrower, I fixed this plate not to the
bottom, but to the side of the vessel, so as to make the water go out
in the direction of a line parallel to the horizon. Then, when the
vessel was full of water, I opened the hole to let it run out; and the
diameter of the stream, measured with great accuracy at the distance of
about half an inch from the hole, was <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{21}{40}" src="images/738.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_738.svg"> of an inch.
Therefore the diameter of this circular hole was to the diameter of the
stream very nearly as 25 to 21. So that the water in passing through
the hole converges on all sides, and, after it has run out of the
vessel, becomes smaller by converging in that manner, and by becoming
smaller is accelerated till it comes to the distance of half an inch
from the hole, and at that distance flows in a smaller stream and with
greater celerity than in the hole itself, and this in the ratio of
25 × 25 to 21 × 21, or 17 to 12, very nearly; that is, in about the
subduplicate ratio of 2 to 1. Now it is certain from experiments, that
the quantity of water running out in a given time through a circular
hole made in the bottom of a vessel is equal to the quantity, which,
flowing with the aforesaid velocity, would run out in the same time
through another circular hole, whose diameter is to the diameter of the
former as 21 to 25. And therefore that running water in passing through
the hole itself has a velocity downwards equal to that which a heavy
body would acquire in falling through half the height of the stagnant
water in the vessel, nearly. But, then, after it has run out, it is
still accelerated by converging, till it arrives at a distance from
the hole that is nearly equal to its diameter, and acquires a velocity
greater than the other in about the subduplicate ratio of 2 to 1; which
velocity a heavy body would nearly acquire by falling through the whole
height of the stagnant water in the vessel.</p>

<figure class="figleft width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_333">
<img alt="If a stream fills lower hole EF, then an upper hole ST, one diameter above EF, must be larger—about 25 to 21 in diameter ratio to EF." height="188" src="images/i_333.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_333.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Therefore in what follows let the diameter of the stream be represented
by that lesser hole which we called EF. And imagine another plane VW
above the hole EF, and parallel to the plane thereof, to be placed at
a distance equal to the diameter of the same hole, and to be pierced
through with a greater hole ST, of such a magnitude that a stream which
will exactly fill the lower hole EF may pass through it; the diameter
of which hole will therefore be to the diameter of the lower hole as
25 to 21, nearly. By this means the water will run perpendicularly out
at the lower hole; and the quantity of the water running out will be,
according to the magnitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span> of this last hole, the same, very nearly,
which the solution of the Problem requires. The space included between
the two planes and the falling stream may be considered as the bottom
of the vessel. But, to make the solution more simple and mathematical,
it is better to take the lower plane alone for the bottom of the
vessel, and to suppose that the water which flowed through the ice as
through a funnel, and ran out of the vessel through the hole EF made
in the lower plane, preserves its motion continually, and that the ice
continues at rest. Therefore in what follows let ST be the diameter of
a circular hole described from the centre Z, and let the stream run out
of the vessel through that hole, when the water in the vessel is all
fluid. And let EF be the diameter of the hole, which the stream, in
falling through, exactly fills up, whether the water runs out of the
vessel by that upper hole ST, or flows through the middle of the ice
in the vessel, as through a funnel. And let the diameter of the upper
hole ST be to the diameter of the lower EF as about 25 to 21, and let
the perpendicular distance between the planes of the holes be equal
to the diameter of the lesser hole EF. Then the velocity of the water
downwards, in running out of the vessel through the hole ST, will be
in that hole the same that a body may acquire by falling from half the
height IZ; and the velocity of both the falling streams will be in the
hole EF, the same which a body would acquire by falling from the whole
height IG.</p>

<p>CASE 2. If the hole EF be not in the middle of the bottom of the
vessel, but in some other part thereof, the water will still run out
with the same velocity as before, if the magnitude of the hole be
the same. For though an heavy body takes a longer time in descending
to the same depth, by an oblique line, than by a perpendicular line,
yet in both cases it acquires in its descent the same velocity; as
<i>Galileo</i> has demonstrated.</p>

<p>CASE 3. The velocity of the water is the same when it runs out through
a hole in the side of the vessel. For if the hole be small, so that
the interval between the superficies AB and KL may vanish as to sense,
and the stream of water horizontally issuing out may form a parabolic
figure; from the latus rectum of this parabola may be collected, that
the velocity of the effluent water is that which a body may acquire by
falling the height IG or HG of the stagnant water in the vessel. For,
by making an experiment, I found that if the height of the stagnant
water above the hole were 20 inches, and the height of the hole above
a plane parallel to the horizon were also 20 inches, a stream of water
springing out from thence would fall upon the plane, at the distance of
37 inches, very nearly, from a perpendicular let fall upon that plane
from the hole. For without resistance the stream would have fallen
upon the plane at the distance of 40 inches, the latus rectum of the
parabolic stream being 80 inches.</p>

<p>CASE 4. If the effluent water tend upward, it will still issue forth
with the same velocity. For the small stream of water springing upward,
ascends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span> with a perpendicular motion to GH or GI, the height of the
stagnant water in the vessel; excepting in so far as its ascent is
hindered a little by the resistance of the air; and therefore it
springs out with the same velocity that it would acquire in falling
from that height. Every particle of the stagnant water is equally
pressed on all sides (by Prop. XIX., Book II), and, yielding to the
pressure, tends always with an equal force, whether it descends through
the hole in the bottom of the vessel, or gushes out in an horizontal
direction through a hole in the side, or passes into a canal, and
springs up from thence through a little hole made in the upper part
of the canal. And it may not only be collected from reasoning, but is
manifest also from the well-known experiments just mentioned, that
the velocity with which the water runs out is the very same that is
assigned in this Proposition.</p>

<p>CASE 5. The velocity of the effluent water is the same, whether the
figure of the hole be circular, or square, or triangular, or any other
figure equal to the circular; for the velocity of the effluent water
does not depend upon the figure of the hole, but arises from its depth
below the plane KL.</p>

<figure class="figleft width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_335">
<img alt="The velocity of the effluent water is the same, whether the figure of the hole be circular, or square, or triangular, or any other figure equal to the circular." height="188" src="images/i_335.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_335.jpg">
</figure>

<p>CASE 6. If the lower part of the vessel ABDC be immersed into stagnant
water, and the height of the stagnant water above the bottom of the
vessel be GR, the velocity with which the water that is in the vessel
will run out at the hole EF into the stagnant water will be the same
which the water would acquire by falling from the height IR; for the
weight of all the water in the vessel that is below the superficies of
the stagnant water will be sustained in equilibrio by the weight of the
stagnant water, and therefore does not at all accelerate the motion
of the descending water in the vessel. This case will also appear by
experiments, measuring the times in which the water will run out.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if CA the depth of the water be produced to K, so that
AK may be to CK in the duplicate ratio of the area of a hole made in
any part of the bottom to the area of the circle AB, the velocity of
the effluent water will be equal to the velocity which the water would
acquire by falling from the height KC.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And the force with which the whole motion of the effluent
water may be generated is equal to the weight of a cylindric column
of water, whose base is the hole EF, and its altitude 2GI or 2CK. For
the effluent water, in the time it becomes equal to this column, may
acquire, by falling by its own weight from the height GI, a velocity
equal to that with which it runs out.</p>

<p>COR. 3. The weight of all the water in the vessel ABDC is to that part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
of the weight which is employed in forcing out the water as the sum
of the circles AB and EF to twice the circle EF. For let IO be a mean
proportional between IH and IG, and the water running out at the hole
EF will, in the time that a drop falling from I would describe the
altitude IG, become equal to a cylinder whose base is the circle EF
and its altitude 2IG, that is, to a cylinder whose base is the circle
AB, and whose altitude is 2IO. For the circle EF is to the circle AB
in the subduplicate ratio of the altitude IH to the altitude IG; that
is, in the simple ratio of the mean proportional IO to the altitude
IG. Moreover, in the time that a drop falling from I can describe
the altitude IH, the water that runs out will have become equal to a
cylinder whose base is the circle AB, and its altitude 2IH; and in
the time that a drop falling from I through H to G describes HG, the
difference of the altitudes, the effluent water, that is, the water
contained within the solid ABNFEM, will be equal to the difference
of the cylinders, that is, to a cylinder whose base is AB, and its
altitude 2HO. And therefore all the water contained in the vessel ABDC
is to the whole falling water contained in the said solid ABNFEM as HG
to 2HO, that is, as HO + OG to 2HO, or IH + IO to 2IH. But the weight
of all the water in the solid ABNFEM is employed in forcing out the
water; and therefore the weight of all the water in the vessel is to
that part of the weight that is employed in forcing out the water as IH
+ IO to 2IH, and therefore as the sum of the circles EF and AB to twice
the circle EF.</p>

<p>COR. 4. And hence the weight of all the water in the vessel ABDC is to
the other part of the weight which is sustained by the bottom of the
vessel as the sum of the circles AB and EF to the difference of the
same circles.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And that part of the weight which the bottom of the vessel
sustains is to the other part of the weight employed in forcing out the
water as the difference of the circles AB and EF to twice the lesser
circle EF, or as the area of the bottom to twice the hole.</p>

<p>COR. 6. That part of the weight which presses upon the bottom is to
the whole weight of the water perpendicularly incumbent thereon as
the circle AB to the sum of the circles AB and EF, or as the circle
AB to the excess of twice the circle AB above the area of the bottom.
For that part of the weight which presses upon the bottom is to the
weight of the whole water in the vessel as the difference of the
circles AB and EF to the sum of the same circles (by Cor. 4); and
the weight of the whole water in the vessel is to the weight of the
whole water perpendicularly incumbent on the bottom as the circle AB
to the difference of the circles AB and EF. Therefore, <i>ex æquo
perturbatè</i>, that part of the weight which presses upon the bottom
is to the weight of the whole water perpendicularly incumbent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span> thereon
as the circle AB to the sum of the circles AB and EF, or the excess of
twice the circle AB above the bottom.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_337">
<img alt="A small circle PQ at the center of hole EF supports more weight than one-third of a water cylinder with base PQ and height GH." height="227" src="images/i_337.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_337.jpg">
</figure>

<p>COR. 7. If in the middle of the hole EF there be placed the little
circle PQ described about the centre G, and parallel to the horizon,
the weight of water which that little circle sustains is greater than
the weight of a third part of a cylinder of water whose base is that
little circle and its height GH. For let ABNFEM be the cataract or
column of falling water whose axis is GH, as above, and let all the
water, whose fluidity is not requisite for the ready and quick descent
of the water, be supposed to be congealed, as well round about the
cataract, as above the little circle. And let PHQ be the column of
water congealed above the little circle, whose vertex is H, and its
altitude GH. And suppose this cataract to fall with its whole weight
downwards, and not in the least to lie against or to press PHQ, but
to glide freely by it without any friction, unless, perhaps, just at
the very vertex of the ice, where the cataract at the beginning of its
fall may tend to a concave figure. And as the congealed water AMEC,
BNFD, lying round the cataract, is convex in its internal superficies
AME, BNF, towards the falling cataract, so this column PHQ will be
convex towards the cataract also, and will therefore be greater than
a cone whose base is that little circle PQ and its altitude GH; that
is, greater than a third part of a cylinder described with the same
base and altitude. Now that little circle sustains the weight of this
column, that is, a weight greater than the weight of the cone, or a
third part of the cylinder.</p>

<p>COR. 8. The weight of water which the circle PQ, when very small,
sustains, seems to be less than the weight of two thirds of a cylinder
of water whose base is that little circle, and its altitude HG. For,
things standing as above supposed, imagine the half of a spheroid
described whose base is that little circle, and its semi-axis or
altitude HG. This figure will be equal to two thirds of that cylinder,
and will comprehend within it the column of congealed water PHQ, the
weight of which is sustained by that little circle. For though the
motion of the water tends directly downwards, the external superficies
of that column must yet meet the base PQ in an angle somewhat acute,
because the water in its fall is perpetually accelerated, and by
reason of that acceleration become narrower. Therefore, since that
angle is less than a right one, this column in the lower parts thereof
will lie within the hemi-spheroid. In the upper parts also it will
be acute or pointed; because to make it otherwise, the horizontal
motion of the water must be at the vertex infinitely more swift than
its motion towards the horizon. And the less this circle PQ is, the
more acute will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span> the vertex of this column be; and the circle being
diminished <i>in infinitum</i>, the angle PHQ will be diminished
<i>in infinitum</i>, and therefore the column will lie within the
hemi-spheroid. Therefore that column is less than that hemi-spheroid,
or than two-third parts of the cylinder whose base is that little
circle, and its altitude GH. Now the little circle sustains a force of
water equal to the weight of this column, the weight of the ambient
water being employed in causing its efflux out at the hole.</p>

<p>COR. 9. The weight of water which the little circle PQ sustains,

that resistance will also remain the same.</p>

<p>If the density of the cylinder be augmented or diminished, its motion,
and the force by which its motion may be generated or destroyed in the

the resistance of any cylinder whatsoever will be to the force by which
its whole motion may be generated or destroyed, in the time during
which it moves four times its length, as the density of the medium to
the density of the cylinder, nearly. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>A fluid must be compressed to become continued; it must be continued
and non-elastic, that all the pressure arising from its compression may
be propagated in an instant; and so, acting equally upon all parts of
the body moved, may produce no change of the resistance. The pressure
arising from the motion of the body is spent in generating a motion
in the parts of the fluid, and this creates the resistance. But the
pressure arising from the compression of the fluid, be it ever so
forcible, if it be propagated in an instant, generates no motion in
the parts of a continued fluid, produces no change at all of motion
therein; and therefore neither augments nor lessens the resistance.
This is certain, that the action of the fluid arising from the
compression cannot be stronger on the hinder parts of the body moved
than on its fore parts, and therefore cannot lessen the resistance
described in this proposition. And if its propagation be infinitely
swifter than the motion of the body pressed, it will not be stronger
on the fore parts than on the hinder parts. But that action will be
infinitely swifter, and propagated in an instant, if the fluid be
continued and non-elastic.</p>

<p>In this proposition we have investigated that resistance alone which
arises from the magnitude of the transverse section of the cylinder,
neglecting that part of the same which may arise from the obliquity
of the motions. For as, in Case 1, of Prop. XXXVI., the obliquity
of the motions with which the parts of the water in the vessel
converged on every side to the hole EF hindered the efflux of the
water through the hole, so, in this Proposition, the obliquity of the
motions, with which the parts of the water, pressed by the antecedent
extremity of the cylinder, yield to the pressure, and diverge on all
sides, retards their passage through the places that lie round that
antecedent extremity, toward the hinder parts of the cylinder, and
causes the fluid to be moved to a greater distance; which increases the
resistance, and that in the same ratio almost in which it diminished
the efflux of the water out of the vessel, that is, in the duplicate
ratio of 25 to 21, nearly. And as, in Case 1, of that Proposition, we
made the parts of the water pass through the hole EF perpendicularly
and in the greatest plenty, by supposing all the water in the vessel
lying round the cataract to be frozen, and that part of the water whose
motion was oblique and useless to remain without motion, so in this
Proposition, that the obliquity of the motions may be taken away, and
the parts of the water may give the freest passage to the cylinder, by
yielding to it with the most direct and quick motion possible, so that
only so much resistance may remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span> as arises from the magnitude of
the transverse section, and which is incapable of diminution, unless
by diminishing the diameter of the cylinder; we must conceive those
parts of the fluid whose motions are oblique and useless, and produce
resistance, to be at rest among themselves at both extremities of the
cylinder, and there to cohere, and be joined to the cylinder.</p>

speaking of, and whose extreme parts ABE and CDF contain the parts of
the fluid at rest among themselves, and concreted into two hard bodies,
adhering to the cylinder at each end like a head and tail. Then if this
solid EACFDB move in the direction of the length of its axis FE toward
the parts beyond E, the resistance will be the same which we have here
determined in this Proposition, nearly; that is, it will have the same
ratio to the force with which the whole motion of the cylinder may be
destroyed or generated, in the time that it is describing the length
4AC with that motion uniformly continued, as the density of the fluid
has to the density of the cylinder, nearly. And (by Cor. 7, Prop.

<p>The case is the same of all convex and round bodies, whose axes
coincide with the axis of the canal. Some difference may arise from
a greater or less friction; but in these <i>Lemmata</i> we suppose
the bodies to be perfectly smooth, and the medium to be void of all
tenacity and friction; and that those parts of the fluid which by their
oblique and superfluous motions may disturb, hinder, and retard the
flux of the water through the canal, are at rest among themselves;
being fixed like water by frost, and adhering to the fore and hinder
parts of the bodies in the manner explained in the Scholium of the last
Proposition; for in what follows we consider the very least resistance
that round bodies described with the greatest given transverse sections
can possibly meet with.</p>

<p>Bodies swimming upon fluids, when they move straight forward, cause
the fluid to ascend at their fore parts and subside at their hinder
parts, especially if they are of an obtuse figure; and thence they meet
with a little more resistance than if they were acute at the head and
tail. And bodies moving in elastic fluids, if they are obtuse behind
and before, condense the fluid a little more at their fore parts, and
relax the same at their hinder parts; and therefore meet also with a
little more resistance than if they were acute at the head and tail.
But in these Lemmas and Propositions we are not treating of elastic but
non-elastic fluids; not of bodies floating on the surface of the fluid,
but deeply immersed therein. And when the resistance of bodies in
non-elastic fluids is once known, we may then augment this resistance a
little in elastic fluids, as our air; and in the surfaces of stagnating
fluids, as lakes and seas.</p>

the globe in the time of its fall, moving with the velocity acquired
in falling, will describe a space that will be to eight third parts of
its diameter as the density of the globe to the density of the fluid;
and the force of its weight which generates this motion will be to the
force that can generate the same motion, in the time that the globe
describes eight third parts of its diameter, with the same velocity as
the density of the fluid to the density of the globe; and therefore (by
this Proposition) the force of weight will be equal to the force of
resistance, and therefore cannot accelerate the globe.</p>

XXXVIII.</p>

<p>This is the resistance that arises from the inactivity of the matter of
the fluid. That resistance which arises from the elasticity, tenacity,
and friction of its parts, may be thus investigated.</p>

<p>Let the globe be let fall so that it may descend in the fluid
by the weight B; and let P be the time of falling, and let that
time be expressed in seconds, if the time G be given in seconds.

<p>That the velocity and descent of a body falling in a fluid might
more easily be known, I have composed the following table; the first
column of which denotes the times of descent; the second shews the
velocities acquired in falling, the greatest velocity being 100000000;
the third exhibits the spaces described by falling in those times,
2F being the space which the body describes in the time G with the
greatest velocity; and the fourth gives the spaces described with the
greatest velocity in the same times. The numbers in the fourth column
are <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{2 \mathrm P}{\mathrm G}" src="images/752.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 3.667ex; height: 4.676ex;" id="img_images_752.svg">,</span> and by subducting the number

<p>In order to investigate the resistances of fluids from experiments,
I procured a square wooden vessel, whose length and breadth on the
inside was 9 inches <i>English</i> measure, and its depth 9 feet
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/643.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_643.svg_12">;</span> this I filled with rain-water: and having provided
globes made up of wax, and lead included therein, I noted the times of
the descents of these globes, the height through which they descended
being 112 inches. A solid cubic foot of <i>English</i> measure contains
76 pounds <i>troy</i> weight of rain water; and a solid inch contains
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{19}{36}" src="images/836.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_836.svg"> ounces <i>troy</i> weight, or <img alt="" data-tex="253\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/837.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_837.svg">
grains; and a globe of water of one inch in diameter contains 132,645
grains in air, or 132,8 grains <i>in vacuo</i>; and any other globe
will be as the excess of its weight <i>in vacuo</i> above its weight in
water.</p>

<p>EXPER. 1. A globe whose weight was <img alt="" data-tex="156\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/838.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_838.svg"> grains in air,
and 77 grains in water, described the whole height of 112 inches in 4
seconds. And, upon repeating the experiment, the globe spent again the
very same time of 4 seconds in falling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span></p>

<p>The weight of this globe <i>in vacuo</i> is <img alt="" data-tex="156\tfrac{13}{38}" src="images/839.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_839.svg">
grains; and the excess of this weight above the weight of the globe
in water is <img alt="" data-tex="79\tfrac{13}{38}" src="images/840.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_840.svg"> grains. Hence the diameter of the
globe appears to be 0,84224 parts of an inch. Then it will be, as that
excess to the weight of the globe <i>in vacuo</i>, so is the density
of the water to the density of the globe; and so is <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{8}{3}" src="images/841.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_841.svg">
parts of the diameter of the globe (viz. 2,24597 inches) to the space
2F, which will be therefore 4,4256 inches. Now a globe falling <i>in
vacuo</i> with its whole weight of <img alt="" data-tex="156\tfrac{13}{38}" src="images/839.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_839.svg_1"> grains in

falling in water in the same time with the weight of 77 grains without
resistance, will describe 95,219 inches; and in the time G, which is
to one second of time in the subduplicate ratio of the space F, or of
2,2128 inches to 95,219 inches, will describe 2,2128 inches, and will
acquire the greatest velocity H with which it is capable of descending
in water. Therefore the time G is 0″,15244. And in this time G, with
that greatest velocity H, the globe will describe the space 2F, which
is 4,4256 inches; and therefore in 4 seconds will describe a space of
116,1245 inches. Subduct the space 1,3862944F, or 3,0676 inches, and
there will remain a space of 113,0569 inches, which the globe falling
through water in a very wide vessel will describe in 4 seconds. But
this space, by reason of the narrowness of the wooden vessel before
mentioned, ought to be diminished in a ratio compounded of the
subduplicate ratio of the orifice of the vessel to the excess of this
orifice above half a great circle of the globe, and of the simple ratio
of the same orifice to its excess above a great circle of the globe,
that is, in a ratio of 1 to 0,9914. This done, we have a space of
112,08 inches, which a globe falling through the water in this wooden
vessel in 4 seconds of time ought nearly to describe by this theory;
but it described 112 inches by the experiment.</p>

<p>EXPER. 2. Three equal globes, whose weights were severally
<img alt="" data-tex="76\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/843.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_843.svg"> grains in air, and <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{1}{16}" src="images/844.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_844.svg"> grains in

grains in its descent through water, will describe in the time
0'',301056 the space of 2,3217 inches; and in 15 seconds the space
115,678 inches. Subduct the space 1,3862944F, or 1,609 inches, and
there remains the space 114,069 inches, which therefore the falling
globe ought to describe in the same time, if the vessel were very wide.
But because our vessel was narrow, the space ought to be diminished by
about 0,895 of an inch. And so the space will remain 113,174 inches,
which a globe falling in this vessel ought nearly to describe in 15
seconds, by the theory. But by the experiment it described 112 inches.
The difference is not sensible.</p>

<p>EXPER. 3. Three equal globes, whose weights were severally 121 grains
in air, and 1 grain in water, were successively let fall; and they fell
through the water in the times 46″, 47″, and 50″, describing a height
of 112 inches.</p>

<p>By the theory, these globes ought to have fallen in about 40″. Now
whether their falling more slowly were occasioned from hence, that in
slow motions the resistance arising from the force of inactivity does
really bear a less proportion to the resistance arising from other
causes; or whether it is to be attributed to little bubbles that might
chance to stick to the globes, or to the rarefaction of the wax by the
warmth of the weather, or of the hand that let them fall; or, lastly,
whether it proceeded from some insensible errors in weighing the globes
in the water, I am not certain. Therefore the weight of the globe in
water should be of several grains, that the experiment may be certain,
and to be depended on.</p>

<p>EXPER. 4. I began the foregoing experiments to investigate the
resistances of fluids, before I was acquainted with the theory laid
down in the Propositions immediately preceding. Afterward, in order to
examine the theory after it was discovered, I procured a wooden vessel,
whose breadth on the inside was <img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/848.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_848.svg"> inches, and its depth
15 feet and <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/227.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_227.svg_2">.</span> Then I made four globes of wax, with lead
included, each of which weighed <img alt="" data-tex="139\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/849.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_849.svg"> grains in air, and
<img alt="" data-tex="7\tfrac{1}{8}" src="images/850.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_850.svg"> grains in water. These I let fall, measuring the
times of their falling in the water with a pendulum oscillating to half
seconds. The globes were cold, and had remained so some time, both when
they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span> weighed and when they were let fall; because warmth rarefies
the wax, and by rarefying it diminishes the weight of the globe in
the water; and wax, when rarefied, is not instantly reduced by cold
to its former density. Before they were let fall, they were totally
immersed under water, lest, by the weight of any part of them that
might chance to be above the water, their descent should be accelerated
in its beginning. Then, when after their immersion they were perfectly
at rest, they were let go with the greatest care, that they might not
receive any impulse from the hand that let them down. And they fell
successively in the times of <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="47\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/851.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_851.svg">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="48\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/852.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_852.svg">,</span>
50, and 51 oscillations, describing a height of 15 feet and 2 inches.
But the weather was now a little colder than when the globes were
weighed, and therefore I repeated the experiment another day; and then
the globes fell in the times of 49, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="49\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/853.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_853.svg">,</span> 50, and 53;
and at a third trial in the times of <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="49\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/853.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_853.svg_1">,</span> 50, 51, and
53 oscillations. And by making the experiment several times over, I
found that the globes fell mostly in the times of <img alt="" data-tex="49\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/853.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_853.svg_2">
and 50 oscillations. When they fell slower, I suspect them to have been
retarded by striking against the sides of the vessel.</p>

<p>Now, computing from the theory, the weight of the globe <i>in vacuo</i>
is <img alt="" data-tex="139\tfrac{2}{5}" src="images/854.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_854.svg"> grains; the excess of this weight above the

<p>By the theory they ought to have fallen in the time of 28 oscillations,
nearly.</p>

<p>In searching for the cause that occasioned these globes of the same
weight and magnitude to fall, some swifter and some slower, I hit
upon this; that the globes, when they were first let go and began to
fall, oscillated about their centres; that side which chanced to be
the heavier descending first, and producing an oscillating motion.
Now by oscillating thus, the globe communicates a greater motion
to the water than if it descended without any oscillations; and by
this communication loses part of its own motion with which it should
descend; and therefore as this oscillation is greater or less, it
will be more or less retarded. Besides, the globe always recedes from
that side of itself which is descending in the oscillation, and by so
receding comes nearer to the sides of the vessel, so as even to strike
against them sometimes. And the heavier the globes are, the stronger
this oscillation is; and the greater they are, the more is the water
agitated by it. Therefore to diminish this oscillation of the globes,
I made new ones of lead and wax, sticking the lead in one side of the
globe very near its surface; and I let fall the globe in such a manner,
that, as near as possible, the heavier side might be lowest at the
beginning of the descent. By this means the oscillations became much
less than before, and the times in which the globes fell were not so
unequal: as in the following experiments.</p>

<p>EXPER. 8. Four globes weighing 139 grains in air, and
<img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/727.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_727.svg_2"> in water, were let fall several times, and fell

oscillations nearly.</p>

<p>From these experiments it is manifest, that when the globes fell
slowly, as in the second, fourth, fifth, eighth, eleventh, and twelfth
experiments, the times of falling are rightly exhibited by the theory;
but when the globes fell more swiftly, as in the sixth, ninth, and
tenth experiments, the resistance was somewhat greater than in the
duplicate ratio of the velocity. For the globes in falling oscillate a
little; and this oscillation, in those globes that are light and fall
slowly, soon ceases by the weakness of the motion; but in greater and
heavier globes, the motion being strong, it continues longer, and is
not to be checked by the ambient water till after several oscillations.
Besides, the more swiftly the globes move, the less are they pressed
by the fluid at their hinder parts; and if the velocity be perpetually
increased, they will at last leave an empty space behind them, unless
the compression of the fluid be increased at the same time. For the
compression of the fluid ought to be increased (by Prop. XXXII and
XXXIII)in the duplicate ratio of the velocity, in order to preserve
the resistance in the same duplicate ratio. But because this is not
done, the globes that move swiftly are not so much pressed at their
hinder parts as the others; and by the defect of this pressure it comes
to pass that their resistance is a little greater than in a duplicate
ratio of their velocity.</p>

<p>So that the theory agrees with the phænomena of bodies falling in
water. It remains that we examine the phænomena of bodies falling in
air.</p>

<p>EXPER. 13. From the top of St. <i>Paul's</i> Church in <i>London</i>,
in <i>June 1710</i>, there were let fall together two glass globes, one
full of quicksilver, the other of air; and in their fall they described
a height of 220 <i>English</i> feet. A wooden table was suspended upon
iron hinges on one side, and the other side of the same was supported
by a wooden pin. The two globes lying upon this table were let fall
together by pulling out the pin by means of an iron wire reaching from
thence quite down to the ground; so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span> that, the pin being removed, the
table, which had then no support but the iron hinges, fell downward,
and turning round upon the hinges, gave leave to the globes to drop off
from it. At the same instant, with the same pull of the iron wire that
took out the pin, a pendulum oscillating to seconds was let go, and
began to oscillate. The diameters and weights of the globes, and their
times of falling, are exhibited in the following table.</p>

<p>But the times observed must be corrected; for the globes of mercury
(by <i>Galileo's</i> theory), in 4 seconds of time, will describe 257
<i>English</i> feet, and 220 feet in only 3″ 42‴. So that the wooden
table, when the pin was taken out, did not turn upon its hinges so
quickly as it ought to have done; and the slowness of that revolution
hindered the descent of the globes at the beginning. For the globes
lay about the middle of the table, and indeed were rather nearer to
the axis upon which it turned than to the pin. And hence the times of
falling were prolonged about 18‴; and therefore ought to be corrected
by subducting that excess, especially in the larger globes, which,
by reason of the largeness of their diameters, lay longer upon the
revolving table than the others. This being done, the times in which
the six larger globes fell will come forth 8″ 12‴, 7″ 42‴, 7″ 42‴, 7″
57‴, 8″ 12‴ and 7″ 42‴.</p>

<p>Therefore the fifth in order among the globes that were full of air
being 5 inches in diameter, and 483 grains in weight, fell in 8″
12‴, describing a space of 220 feet. The weight of a bulk of water
equal to this globe is 16600 grains; and the weight of an equal bulk
of air is <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{16600}{860}" src="images/883.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.995ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_883.svg"> grains, or <img alt="" data-tex="19\tfrac{3}{10}" src="images/884.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_884.svg">

<p>EXPER. 14. <i>Anno 1719</i>, in the month of <i>July</i>, Dr.
<i>Desaguliers</i> made some experiments of this kind again, by forming
hogs' bladders into spherical orbs; which was done by means of a
concave wooden sphere, which the bladders, being wetted well first,
were put into. After that being blown full of air, they were obliged
to fill up the spherical cavity that contained them; and then, when
dry, were taken out. These were let fall from the lantern on the top
of the cupola of the same church, namely, from a height of 272 feet;
and at the same moment of time there was let fall a leaden globe,
whose weight was about 2 pounds <i>troy</i> weight. And in the mean
time some persons standing in the upper part of the church where
the globes were let fall observed the whole times of falling; and
others standing on the ground observed the differences of the times
between the fall of the leaden weight and the fall of the bladder.
The times were measured by pendulums oscillating to half seconds.
And one of those that stood upon the ground had a machine vibrating
four times in one second; and another had another machine accurately
made with a pendulum vibrating four times in a second also. One of
those also who stood at the top of the church had a like machine;
and these instruments were so contrived, that their motions could be
stopped or renewed at pleasure. Now the leaden globe fell in about
four seconds and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/228.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_228.svg_8"> of time; and from the addition of
this time to the difference of time above spoken of, was collected
the whole time in which the bladder was falling. The times which the
five bladders spent in falling, after the leaden globe had reached the
ground, were, the first time, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="14\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/890.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_890.svg">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="12\tfrac{3}{4}''" src="images/891.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.014ex;" id="img_images_891.svg">,</span>

<p>Our theory, therefore, exhibits rightly, within a very little, all the
resistance that globes moving either in air or in water meet with;
which appears to be proportional to the densities of the fluids in
globes of equal velocities and magnitudes.</p>

<p>In the Scholium subjoined to the sixth Section, we shewed, by
experiments of pendulums, that the resistances of equal and equally
swift globes moving in air, water, and quicksilver, are as the
densities of the fluids. We here prove the same more accurately by
experiments of bodies falling in air and water. For pendulums at each
oscillation excite a motion in the fluid always contrary to the motion
of the pendulum in its return; and the resistance arising from this
motion, as also the resistance of the thread by which the pendulum is
suspended, makes the whole resistance of a pendulum greater than the
resistance deduced from the experiments of falling bodies. For by the
experiments of pendulums described in that Scholium, a globe of the
same density as water in describing the length of its semi-diameter in
air would lose the <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{3342}" src="images/666.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_666.svg_1"> part of its motion. But by the
theory delivered in this seventh Section, and confirmed by experiments
of falling bodies, the same globe in describing the same length would
lose only a part of its motion equal to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4586}" src="images/918.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_918.svg">,</span> supposing
the density of water to be to the density of air as 860 to 1. Therefore
the resistances were found greater by the experiments of pendulums
(for the reasons just mentioned) than by the experiments of falling
globes; and that in the ratio of about 4 to 3. But yet since the
resistances of pendulums oscillating in air, water, and quicksilver,
are alike increased by like causes, the proportion of the resistances
in these mediums will be rightly enough exhibited by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span> experiments
of pendulums, as well as by the experiments of falling bodies. And from
all this it may be concluded, that the resistances of bodies, moving
in any fluids whatsoever, though of the most extreme fluidity, are,
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, as the densities of the fluids.</p>

<p>These things being thus established, we may now determine what part of
its motion any globe projected in any fluid whatsoever would nearly
lose in a given time. Let D be the diameter of the globe, and V its
velocity at the beginning of its motion, and T the time in which a
globe with the velocity V can describe <i>in vacuo</i> a space that is,
to the space <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{8}{3}\mathrm D" src="images/919.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 3.855ex; height: 4.638ex;" id="img_images_919.svg"> as the density of the globe to
the density of the fluid; and the globe projected in that fluid will,
in any other time <i>t</i> lose the part <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{t\mathrm V}{\mathrm T + t}" src="images/920.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.738ex; width: 6.211ex; height: 4.812ex;" id="img_images_920.svg">,</span>
the part <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{TV}}{\mathrm T + t}" src="images/921.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.738ex; width: 6.211ex; height: 4.812ex;" id="img_images_921.svg"> remaining;
and will describe a space, which will be to that described in the same

Cor. 7, Prop. XXXV. In slow motions the resistance may be a little
less, because the figure of a globe is more adapted to motion than the
figure of a cylinder described with the same diameter. In swift motions
the resistance may be a little greater, because the elasticity and
compression of the fluid do not increase in the duplicate ratio of the
velocity. But these little niceties I take no notice of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span></p>

<p>And though air, water, quicksilver, and the like fluids, by the
division of their parts <i>in infinitum</i>, should be subtilized, and
become mediums infinitely fluid, nevertheless, the resistance they
would make to projected globes would be the same. For the resistance
considered in the preceding Propositions arises from the inactivity
of the matter; and the inactivity of matter is essential to bodies,
and always proportional to the quantity of matter. By the division
of the parts of the fluid the resistance arising from the tenacity
and friction of the parts may be indeed diminished; but the quantity
of matter will not be at all diminished by this division; and if the
quantity of matter be the same, its force of inactivity will be the
same; and therefore the resistance here spoken of will be the same, as
being always proportional to that force. To diminish this resistance,
the quantity of matter in the spaces through which the bodies move
must be diminished; and therefore the celestial spaces, through which
the globes of the planets and comets are perpetually passing towards
all parts, with the utmost freedom, and without the least sensible
diminution of their motion, must be utterly void of any corporeal
fluid, excepting, perhaps, some extremely rare vapours and the rays of
light.</p>

<p>Projectiles excite a motion in fluids as they pass through them, and
this motion arises from the excess of the pressure of the fluid at
the fore parts of the projectile above the pressure of the same at
the hinder parts; and cannot be less in mediums infinitely fluid than
it is in air, water, and quicksilver, in proportion to the density of
matter in each. Now this excess of pressure does, in proportion to its
quantity, not only excite a motion in the fluid, but also acts upon the
projectile so as to retard its motion; and therefore the resistance in
every fluid is as the motion excited by the projectile in the fluid;
and cannot be less in the most subtile æther in proportion to the
density of that æther, than it is in air, water, and quicksilver, in
proportion to the densities of those fluids.</p>

</figure>

<p>COR. If any part of a pressure, propagated through a fluid from a given
point, be intercepted by any obstacle, the remaining part, which is
not intercepted, will deflect into the spaces behind the obstacle.
This may be demonstrated also after the following manner. Let a
pressure be propagated from the point A towards any part, and, if it
be possible, in rectilinear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span> directions; and the obstacle NBCK being
perforated in BC, let all the pressure be intercepted but the coniform
part APQ passing through the circular hole BC. Let the cone APQ be
divided into frustums by the transverse planes, <i>de</i>, <i>fg</i>,
<i>hi</i>. Then while the cone ABC, propagating the pressure, urges
the conic frustum <i>degf</i> beyond it on the superficies <i>de</i>,
and this frustum urges the next frustum <i>fgih</i> on the superficies
<i>fg</i>, and that frustum urges a third frustum, and so <i>in
infinitum</i>; it is manifest (by the third Law) that the first frustum
<i>defg</i> is, by the re-action of the second frustum <i>fghi</i>,
as much urged and pressed on the superficies <i>fg</i>, as it urges
and presses that second frustum. Therefore the frustum <i>degf</i> is
compressed on both sides, that is, between the cone A<i>de</i> and
the frustum <i>fhig</i>; and therefore (by Case 6, Prop. XIX) cannot
preserve its figure, unless it be compressed with the same force on
all sides. Therefore with the same force with which it is pressed on
the superficies <i>de</i>, <i>fg</i>, it will endeavour to break forth
at the sides <i>df</i>, <i>eg</i>; and there (being not in the least
tenacious or hard, but perfectly fluid) it will run out, expanding
itself, unless there be an ambient fluid opposing that endeavour.
Therefore, by the effort it makes to run out, it will press the ambient
fluid, at its sides <i>df</i>, <i>eg</i>, with the same force that
it does the frustum <i>fghi</i>; and therefore, the pressure will be
propagated as much from the sides <i>df</i>, <i>eg</i>, into the spaces
NO, KL this way and that way, as it is propagated from the superficies
<i>fg</i> towards PQ. Q.E.D.</p>

</figure>

<p>CASE 1. Let a motion be propagated from the point A through the hole
BC, and, if it be possible, let it proceed in the conic space BCQP
according to right lines diverging from the point A. And let us first
suppose this motion to be that of waves in the surface of standing
water; and let <i>de</i>, <i>fg</i>, <i>hi</i>, <i>kl</i>, &amp;c., be
the tops of the several waves, divided from each other by as many
intermediate valleys or hollows. Then, because the water in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span> ridges
of the waves is higher than in the unmoved parts of the fluid KL, NO,
it will run down from off the tops of those ridges, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>,
<i>i</i>, <i>l</i>, &amp;c., <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>, &amp;c.,
this way and that way towards KL and NO; and because the water is
more depressed in the hollows of the waves than in the unmoved parts
of the fluid KL, NO, it will run down into those hollows out of these
unmoved parts. By the first deflux the ridges of the waves will dilate
themselves this way and that way, and be propagated towards KL and NO.
And because the motion of the waves from A towards PQ is carried on
by a continual deflux from the ridges of the waves into the hollows
next to them, and therefore cannot be swifter than in proportion to
the celerity of the descent; and the descent of the water on each side
towards KL and NO must be performed with the same velocity; it follows
that the dilatation of the waves on each side towards KL and NO will be
propagated with the same velocity as the waves themselves go forward
with directly from A to PQ. And therefore the whole space this way
and that way towards KL and NO will be filled by the dilated waves
<i>rfgr</i>, <i>shis</i>, <i>tklt</i>, <i>vmnv</i>, &amp;c. Q.E.D. That
these things are so, any one may find by making the experiment in still
water.</p>

<p>CASE 2. Let us suppose that <i>de</i>, <i>fg</i>, <i>hi</i>, <i>kl</i>,
<i>mn</i>, represent pulses successively propagated from the point
A through an elastic medium. Conceive the pulses to be propagated
by successive condensations and rarefactions of the medium, so that
the densest part of every pulse may occupy a spherical superficies
described about the centre A, and that equal intervals intervene
between the successive pulses. Let the lines <i>de</i>, <i>fg</i>,
<i>hi</i>, <i>kl</i>, &amp;c., represent the densest parts of the pulses,
propagated through the hole BC; and because the medium is denser there
than in the spaces on either side towards KL and NO, it will dilate
itself as well towards those spaces KL, NO, on each hand, as towards
the rare intervals between the pulses; and thence the medium, becoming
always more rare next the intervals, and more dense next the pulses,
will partake of their motion. And because the progressive motion of
the pulses arises from the perpetual relaxation of the denser parts
towards the antecedent rare intervals; and since the pulses will relax
themselves on each hand towards the quiescent parts of the medium KL,
NO, with very near the same celerity; therefore the pulses will dilate
themselves on all sides into the unmoved parts KL, NO, with almost
the same celerity with which they are propagated directly from the
centre A; and therefore will fill up the whole space KLON. Q.E.D. And
we find the same by experience also in sounds which are heard through
a mountain interposed; and, if they come into a chamber through the
window, dilate themselves into all the parts of the room, and are heard
in every corner; and not as reflected from the opposite walls, but
directly propagated from the window, as far as our sense can judge.</p>

<p>CASE 3. Let us suppose, lastly, that a motion of any kind is
propagated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span> from A through the hole BC. Then since the cause of this
propagation is that the parts of the medium that are near the centre
A disturb and agitate those which lie farther from it; and since the
parts which are urged are fluid, and therefore recede every way towards
those spaces where they are less pressed, they will by consequence
recede towards all the parts of the quiescent medium; as well to the
parts on each hand, as KL and NO, as to those right before, as PQ; and
by this means all the motion, as soon as it has passed through the hole
BC, will begin to dilate itself, and from thence, as from its principle
and centre, will be propagated directly every way. Q.E.D.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XLIII. THEOREM XXXIV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Every tremulous body in an elastic medium propagates the motion of
the pulses on every side right forward; but in a non-elastic medium
excites a circular motion.</i></p>
</div>

<p>CASE. 1. The parts of the tremulous body, alternately going and
returning, do in going urge and drive before them those parts of the
medium that lie nearest, and by that impulse compress and condense
them; and in returning suffer those compressed parts to recede again,
and expand themselves. Therefore the parts of the medium that lie
nearest to the tremulous body move to and fro by turns, in like
manner as the parts of the tremulous body itself do; and for the
same cause that the parts of this body agitate these parts of the
medium, these parts, being agitated by like tremors, will in their
turn agitate others next to themselves; and these others, agitated
in like manner, will agitate those that lie beyond them, and so on
<i>in infinitum</i>. And in the same manner as the first parts of the
medium were condensed in going, and relaxed in returning, so will the
other parts be condensed every time they go, and expand themselves
every time they return. And therefore they will not be all going and
all returning at the same instant (for in that case they would always
preserve determined distances from each other, and there could be no
alternate condensation and rarefaction); but since, in the places where
they are condensed, they approach to, and, in the places where they
are rarefied, recede from each other, therefore some of them will be
going while others are returning; and so on <i>in infinitum</i>. The
parts so going, and in their going condensed, are pulses, by reason
of the progressive motion with which they strike obstacles in their
way; and therefore the successive pulses produced by a tremulous body
will be propagated in rectilinear directions; and that at nearly
equal distances from each other, because of the equal intervals of
time in which the body, by its several tremors produces the several
pulses. And though the parts of the tremulous body go and return in
some certain and determinate direction, yet the pulses propagated from
thence through the medium will dilate themselves towards the sides, by
the foregoing Proposition; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span> will be propagated on all sides from
that tremulous body, as from a common centre, in superficies nearly
spherical and concentrical. An example of this we have in waves excited
by shaking a finger in water, which proceed not only forward and
backward agreeably to the motion of the finger, but spread themselves
in the manner of concentrical circles all round the finger, and are
propagated on every side. For the gravity of the water supplies the
place of elastic force.</p>

<p>CASE 2. If the medium be not elastic, then, because its parts cannot
be condensed by the pressure arising from the vibrating parts of the
tremulous body, the motion will be propagated in an instant towards the
parts where the medium yields most easily, that is, to the parts which
the tremulous body would otherwise leave vacuous behind it. The case is
the same with that of a body projected in any medium whatever. A medium
yielding to projectiles does not recede <i>in infinitum</i>, but with a
circular motion comes round to the spaces which the body leaves behind
it. Therefore as often as a tremulous body tends to any part, the
medium yielding to it comes round in a circle to the parts which the
body leaves; and as often as the body returns to the first place, the
medium will be driven from the place it came round to, and return to
its original place. And though the tremulous body be not firm and hard,
but every way flexible, yet if it continue of a given magnitude, since
it cannot impel the medium by its tremors any where without yielding to
it somewhere else, the medium receding from the parts of the body where
it is pressed will always come round in a circle to the parts that
yield to it. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. It is a mistake, therefore, to think, as some have done, that
the agitation of the parts of flame conduces to the propagation of
a pressure in rectilinear directions through an ambient medium. A
pressure of that kind must be derived not from the agitation only of
the parts of flame, but from the dilatation of the whole.</p>

<p>I measure the length of the water along the axes of the canal and its
legs, and make it equal to the sum of those axes; and take no notice
of the resistance of the water arising from its attrition by the sides
of the canal. Let, therefore, AB, CD, represent the mean height of the
water in both legs; and when the water in the leg KL ascends to the
height EF, the water will descend in the leg MN to the height GH. Let
P be a pendulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span> body, VP the thread, V the point of suspension, RPQS
the cycloid which the pendulum describes, P its lowest point, PQ an arc
equal to the height AE. The force with which the motion of the water is
accelerated and retarded alternately is the excess of the weight of the
water in one leg above the weight in the other; and, therefore, when
the water in the leg KL ascends to EF, and in the other leg descends to
GH, that force is double the weight of the water EABF, and therefore
is to the weight of the whole water as AE or PQ to VP or PR. The force
also with which the body P is accelerated or retarded in any place,
as Q, of a cycloid, is (by Cor. Prop. LI) to its whole weight as its
distance PQ from the lowest place P to the length PR of the cycloid.
Therefore the motive forces of the water and pendulum, describing the
equal spaces AE, PQ, are as the weights to be moved; and therefore if
the water and pendulum are quiescent at first, those forces will move
them in equal times, and will cause them to go and return together with
a reciprocal motion. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore the reciprocations of the water in ascending and
descending are all performed in equal times, whether the motion be more
or less intense or remiss.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If the length of the whole water in the canal be of
<img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{9}" src="images/922.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_922.svg"> feet of <i>French</i> measure, the water will descend

the time of the reciprocation will be increased or diminished in the

<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XLV. THEOREM XXXVI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The velocity of waves is in the subduplicate ratio of the

</div>

<p>This follows from the construction of the following Proposition.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XLVI. PROBLEM X.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To find the velocity of waves.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Let a pendulum be constructed, whose length between the point of
suspension and the centre of oscillation is equal to the breadth of
the waves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span> and in the time that the pendulum will perform one single
oscillation the waves will advance forward nearly a space equal to
their breadth.</p>

<img alt="A pendulum with length equal to wave breadth completes one oscillation as the waves move forward by roughly their breadth." height="46" src="images/i_362.jpg" width="250" id="img_images_i_362.jpg">
</figure>

<p>That which I call the breadth of the waves is the transverse measure
lying between the deepest part of the hollows, or the tops of the
ridges. Let ABCDEF represent the surface of stagnant water ascending
and descending in successive waves; and let A, C, E, &amp;c., be the tops
of the waves; and let B, D, F, &amp;c., be the intermediate hollows.
Because the motion of the waves is carried on by the successive ascent
and descent of the water, so that the parts thereof, as A, C, E, &amp;c.,
which are highest at one time become lowest immediately after; and
because the motive force, by which the highest parts descend and the
lowest ascend, is the weight of the elevated water, that alternate
ascent and descent will be analogous to the reciprocal motion of the
water in the canal, and observe the same laws as to the times of its
ascent and descent; and therefore (by Prop. XLIV) if the distances
between the highest places of the waves A, C, E, and the lowest B, D,
F, be equal to twice the length of any pendulum, the highest parts A,
C, E, will become the lowest in the time of one oscillation, and in the
time of another oscillation will ascend again. Therefore between the
passage of each wave, the time of two oscillations will intervene; that
is, the wave will describe its breadth in the time that pendulum will
oscillate twice; but a pendulum of four times that length, and which
therefore is equal to the breadth of the waves, will just oscillate
once in that time. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore waves, whose breadth is equal to <img alt="" data-tex="3\tfrac{1}{18}" src="images/923.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_923.svg_1">
<i>French</i> feet, will advance through a space equal to their breadth
in one second of time; and therefore in one minute will go over a space
of <img alt="" data-tex="183\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/924.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_924.svg"> feet; and in an hour a space of 11000 feet,
nearly.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And the velocity of greater or less waves will be augmented or
diminished in the subduplicate ratio of their breadth.</p>

<p>These things are true upon the supposition that the parts of water
ascend or descend in a right line; but, in truth, that ascent and
descent is rather performed in a circle; and therefore I propose the
time defined by this Proposition as only near the truth.</p>

same with the number of the vibrations of the tremulous body, and is
not multiplied in their progress. For the physical lineola <img alt="" data-tex="\epsilon \gamma" src="images/933.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 2.147ex; height: 1.486ex;" id="img_images_933.svg_9">
as soon as it returns to its first place is at rest; neither
will it move again, unless it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span> receives a new motion either from the
impulse of the tremulous body, or of the pulses propagated from that
body. As soon, therefore, as the pulses cease to be propagated from the
tremulous body, it will return to a state of rest, and move no more.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XLVIII. THEOREM XXXVIII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The velocities of pulses propagated in an elastic fluid are in
a ratio compounded of the subduplicate ratio of the elastic force
directly, and the subduplicate ratio of the density inversely;
supposing the elastic force of the fluid to be proportional to its
condensation.</i></p>
</div>

<p>CASE 1. If the mediums be homogeneous, and the distances of the
pulses in those mediums be equal amongst themselves, but the motion
in one medium is more intense than in the other, the contractions
and dilatations of the correspondent parts will be as those motions;
not that this proportion is perfectly accurate. However, if the
contractions and dilatations are not exceedingly intense, the
error will not be sensible; and therefore this proportion may be
considered as physically exact. Now the motive elastic forces are
as the contractions and dilatations; and the velocities generated
in the same time in equal parts are as the forces. Therefore equal
and corresponding parts of corresponding pulses will go and return
together, through spaces proportional to their contractions and
dilatations, with velocities that are as those spaces; and therefore
the pulses, which in the time of one going and returning advance
forward a space equal to their breadth, and are always succeeding into
the places of the pulses that immediately go before them, will, by
reason of the equality of the distances, go forward in both mediums
with equal velocity.</p>

<p>CASE 2. If the distances of the pulses or their lengths are greater in
one medium than in another, let us suppose that the correspondent parts
describe spaces, in going and returning, each time proportional to the
breadths of the pulses; then will their contractions and dilatations be
equal; and therefore if the mediums are homogeneous, the motive elastic
forces, which agitate them with a reciprocal motion, will be equal
also. Now the matter to be moved by these forces is as the breadth of
the pulses; and the space through which they move every time they go
and return is in the same ratio. And, moreover, the time of one going
and returning is in a ratio compounded of the subduplicate ratio of
the matter, and the subduplicate ratio of the space; and therefore is
as the space. But the pulses advance a space equal to their breadths
in the times of going once and returning once; that is, they go over
spaces proportional to the times, and therefore are equally swift.</p>

<p>CASE 3. And therefore in mediums of equal density and elastic force,
all the pulses are equally swift. Now if the density or the elastic
force of the medium were augmented, then, because the motive force
is increased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span> in the ratio of the elastic force, and the matter to
be moved is increased in the ratio of the density, the time which is
necessary for producing the same motion as before will be increased in
the subduplicate ratio of the density, and will be diminished in the
subduplicate ratio of the elastic force. And therefore the velocity of
the pulses will be in a ratio compounded of the subduplicate ratio of
the density of the medium inversely, and the subduplicate ratio of the
elastic force directly. Q.E.D.</p>

manner of our air; and let A be the height of a homogeneous medium,
whose weight is equal to the incumbent weight, and whose density is the
same with the density of the compressed medium in which the pulses are
propagated. Suppose a pendulum to be constructed whose length between
the point of suspension and the centre of oscillation is A: and in
the time in which that pendulum will perform one entire oscillation
composed of its going and returning, the pulse will be propagated
right onwards through a space equal to the circumference of a circle
described with the radius A.</p>

<img alt="The density and elastic force of a medium being given, to find the velocity of the pulses." height="569" src="images/i_367a.jpg" width="100" id="img_images_i_367a.jpg">
</figure>

<p>For, letting those things stand which were constructed in Prop. XLVII,
if any physical line, as EF, describing the space PS in each vibration,
be acted on in the extremities P and S of every going and return that
it makes by an elastic force that is equal to its weight, it will
perform its several vibrations in the time in which the same might
oscillate in a cycloid whose whole perimeter is equal to the length
PS; and that because equal forces will impel equal corpuscles through
equal spaces in the same or equal times. Therefore since the times of
the oscillations are in the subduplicate ratio of the lengths of the
pendulums, and the length of the pendulum is equal to half the arc of
the whole cycloid, the time of one vibration would be to the time of
the oscillation of a pendulum whose length is A in the subduplicate
ratio of the length <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{PS}" src="images/944.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.594ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_944.svg"> or PO to the length A.
But the elastic force with which the physical lineola EG is urged, when
it is found in its extreme places P, S, was (in the demonstration of
Prop. XLVII) to its whole elastic force as HL - KN to V, that is (since
the point K now falls upon P), as HK to V: and all that force, or which
is the same thing, the incumbent weight by which the lineola EG is
compressed, is to the weight of the lineola as the altitude A of the
incumbent weight to EG the length of the lineola; and therefore, <i>ex
æquo</i>, the force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span> with which the lineola EG is urged in the places P
and S is to the weight of that lineola as HK × A to V × EG; or as PO ×
A to VV; because HK was to EG as PO to V. Therefore since the times in
which equal bodies are impelled through equal spaces are reciprocally
in the subduplicate ratio of the forces, the time of one vibration,
produced by the action of that elastic force, will be to the time of
a vibration, produced by the impulse of the weight in a subduplicate
ratio of VV to PO × A, and therefore to the time of the oscillation of
a pendulum whose length is A in the subduplicate ratio of VV to PO ×
A, and the subduplicate ratio of PO to A conjunctly; that is, in the
entire ratio of V to A. But in the time of one vibration composed of
the going and returning of the pendulum, the pulse will be propagated
right onward through a space equal to its breadth BC.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width:150px;" id="i_367b">
<img alt="The pulse travel time over BC relates to one pendulum oscillation time as BC is to the circumference of a circle with radius A." height="171" src="images/i_367b.jpg" width="150" id="img_images_i_367b.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Therefore the time in which a pulse runs over the space BC is to the
time of one oscillation composed of the going and returning of the
pendulum as V to A, that is, as BC to the circumference of a circle
whose radius is A. But the time in which the pulse will run over the
space BC is to the time in which it will run over a length equal to
that circumference in the same ratio; and therefore in the time of
such an oscillation the pulse will run over a length equal to that
circumference. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. The velocity of the pulses is equal to that which heavy bodies
acquire by falling with an equally accelerated motion, and in their
fall describing half the altitude A. For the pulse will, in the time
of this fall, supposing it to move with the velocity acquired by that
fall, run over a space that will be equal to the whole altitude A; and
therefore in the time of one oscillation composed of one going and
return, will go over a space equal to the circumference of a circle
described with the radius A; for the time of the fall is to the time of
oscillation as the radius of a circle to its circumference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span></p>

<p>COR. 2. Therefore since that altitude A is as the elastic force of the
fluid directly, and the density of the same inversely, the velocity of
the pulses will be in a ratio compounded of the subduplicate ratio of
the density inversely, and the subduplicate ratio of the elastic force
directly.</p>

found will be the breadth of one pulse. Q.E.I.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>The last Propositions respect the motions of light and sounds; for
since light is propagated in right lines, it is certain that it
cannot consist in action alone (by Prop. XLI and XLII). As to sounds,
since they arise from tremulous bodies, they can be nothing else but
pulses of the air propagated through it (by Prop. XLIII); and this is
confirmed by the tremors which sounds, if they be loud and deep, excite
in the bodies near them, as we experience in the sound of drums; for
quick and short tremors are less easily excited. But it is well known
that any sounds, falling upon strings in unison with the sonorous
bodies, excite tremors in those strings. This is also confirmed from
the velocity of sounds; for since the specific gravities of rain-water
and quicksilver are to one another as about 1 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="13\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/945.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_945.svg">,</span>
and when the mercury in the barometer is at the height of 30 inches of
our measure, the specific gravities of the air and of rain-water are to
one another as about 1 to 870, therefore the specific gravity of air
and quicksilver are to each other as 1 to 11890. Therefore when the
height of the quicksilver is at 30 inches, a height of uniform air,
whose weight would be sufficient to compress our air to the density
we find it to be of, must be equal to 356700 inches, or 29725 feet
of our measure; and this is that very height of the medium, which I
have called A in the construction of the foregoing Proposition. A
circle whose radius is 29725 feet is 186768 feet in circumference. And
since a pendulum <img alt="" data-tex="39\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/946.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_946.svg"> inches in length completes one
oscillation, composed of its going and return, in two seconds of time,
as is commonly known, it follows that a pendulum 29725 feet, or 356700
inches in length will perform a like oscillation in <img alt="" data-tex="190\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/947.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_947.svg">
seconds. Therefore in that time a sound will go right onwards 186768
feet, and therefore in one second 979 feet.</p>

<p>But in this computation we have made no allowance for the crassitude
of the solid particles of the air, by which the sound is propagated
instantaneously. Because the weight of air is to the weight of water as
1 to 870, and because salts are almost twice as dense as water; if the
particles of air are supposed to be of near the same density as those
of water or salt, and the rarity of the air arises from the intervals
of the particles; the diameter of one particle of air will be to the
interval between the centres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span> of the particles as 1 to about 9 or 10,
and to the interval between the particles themselves as 1 to 8 or 9.
Therefore to 979 feet, which, according to the above calculation,
a sound will advance forward in one second of time, we may add
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{979}{9}" src="images/948.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_948.svg">,</span> or about 109 feet, to compensate for the crassitude
of the particles of the air: and then a sound will go forward about
1088 feet in one second of time.</p>

<p>Moreover, the vapours floating in the air being of another spring, and
a different tone, will hardly, if at all, partake of the motion of
the true air in which the sounds are propagated. Now if these vapours
remain unmoved, that motion will be propagated the swifter through
the true air alone, and that in the subduplicate ratio of the defect
of the matter. So if the atmosphere consist of ten parts of true air
and one part of vapours, the motion of sounds will be swifter in the
subduplicate ratio of 11 to 10, or very nearly in the entire ratio of
21 to 20, than if it were propagated through eleven parts of true air:
and therefore the motion of sounds above discovered must be increased
in that ratio. By this means the sound will pass through 1142 feet in
one second of time.</p>

<p>These things will be found true in spring and autumn, when the air
is rarefied by the gentle warmth of those seasons, and by that means
its elastic force becomes somewhat more intense. But in winter, when
the air is condensed by the cold, and its elastic force is somewhat
remitted, the motion of sounds will be slower in a subduplicate ratio
of the density; and, on the other hand, swifter in the summer.</p>

<p>Now by experiments it actually appears that sounds do really advance in
one second of time about 1142 feet of <i>English</i> measure, or 1070
feet of <i>French</i> measure.</p>

<p>The velocity of sounds being known, the intervals of the pulses are
known also. For M. <i>Sauveur</i>, by some experiments that he made,
found that an open pipe about five <i>Paris</i> feet in length gives
a sound of the same tone with a viol-string that vibrates a hundred
times in one second. Therefore there are near 100 pulses in a space of
1070 <i>Paris</i> feet, which a sound runs over in a second of time;
and therefore one pulse fills up a space of about <img alt="" data-tex="10\tfrac{7}{10}" src="images/949.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_949.svg">
<i>Paris</i> feet, that is, about twice the length of the pipe. From
whence it is probable that the breadths of the pulses, in all sounds
made in open pipes, are equal to twice the length of the pipes.</p>

<p>Moreover, from the Corollary of Prop. XLVII appears the reason why the
sounds immediately cease with the motion of the sonorous body, and
why they are heard no longer when we are at a great distance from the
sonorous bodies than when we are very near them. And besides, from
the foregoing principles, it plainly appears how it comes to pass
that sounds are so mightily increased in speaking-trumpets; for all
reciprocal motion uses to be increased by the generating cause at each
return. And in tubes hindering the dilatation of the sounds, the motion
decays more slowly, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span> recurs more forcibly; and therefore is the
more increased by the new motion impressed at each return. And these
are the principal phænomena of sounds.</p>

<p>Let AFL be a cylinder turning uniformly about the axis S, and let
the concentric circles BGM, CHN, DIO, EKP, &amp;c., divide the fluid
into innumerable concentric cylindric solid orbs of the same
thickness. Then, because the fluid is homogeneous, the impressions
which the contiguous orbs make upon each other mutually will be (by
the Hypothesis) as their translations from each other, and as the
contiguous superficies upon which the impressions are made. If the
impression made upon any orb be greater or less on its concave than
on its convex side, the stronger impression will prevail, and will
either accelerate or retard the motion of the orb, according as it
agrees with, or is contrary to, the motion of the same. Therefore, that
every orb may persevere uniformly in its motion, the impressions made
on both sides must be equal and their directions contrary. Therefore
since the impressions are as the contiguous superficies, and as their
translations from one another, the translations will be inversely as
the superficies, that is, inversely as the distances of the superficies
from the axis. But the differences of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span> the angular motions about the
axis are as those translations applied to the distances, or as the
translations directly and the distances inversely; that is, joining
these ratios together, as the squares of the distances inversely.
Therefore if there be erected the lines A<i>a</i>, B<i>b</i>,
C<i>c</i>, D<i>d</i>, E<i>e</i>, &amp;c., perpendicular to the several
parts of the infinite right line SABCDEQ, and reciprocally proportional
to the squares of SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, &amp;c., and through the extremities
of those perpendiculars there be supposed to pass an hyperbolic curve,
the sums of the differences, that is, the whole angular motions,
will be as the correspondent sums of the lines A<i>a</i>, B<i>b</i>,
C<i>c</i>, D<i>d</i>, E<i>e</i>, that is (if to constitute a medium
uniformly fluid the number of the orbs be increased and their breadth
diminished <i>in infinitum</i>), as the hyperbolic areas A<i>a</i>Q,
B<i>b</i>Q, C<i>c</i>Q, D<i>d</i>Q, E<i>e</i>Q, &amp;c., analogous to the
sums; and the times, reciprocally proportional to the angular motions,
will be also reciprocally proportional to those areas. Therefore
the periodic time of any particle as D, is reciprocally as the area
D<i>d</i>Q, that is (as appears from the known methods of quadratures
of curves), directly as the distance SD. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence the angular motions of the particles of the fluid are
reciprocally as their distances from the axis of the cylinder, and the
absolute velocities are equal.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If a fluid be contained in a cylindric vessel of an infinite
length, and contain another cylinder within, and both the cylinders
revolve about one common axis, and the times of their revolutions be
as their semi-diameters, and every part of the fluid perseveres in
its motion, the periodic times of the several parts will be as the
distances from the axis of the cylinders.</p>

<p>COR. 3. If there be added or taken away any common quantity of angular
motion from the cylinder and fluid moving in this manner; yet because
this new motion will not alter the mutual attrition of the parts
of the fluid, the motion of the parts among themselves will not be
changed; for the translations of the parts from one another depend
upon the attrition. Any part will persevere in that motion, which, by
the attrition made on both sides with contrary directions, is no more
accelerated than it is retarded.</p>

<p>COR. 4. Therefore if there be taken away from this whole system of the
cylinders and the fluid all the angular motion of the outward cylinder,
we shall have the motion of the fluid in a quiescent cylinder.</p>

<p>COR. 5. Therefore if the fluid and outward cylinder are at rest, and
the inward cylinder revolve uniformly, there will be communicated a
circular motion to the fluid, which will be propagated by degrees
through the whole fluid; and will go on continually increasing,
till such time as the several parts of the fluid acquire the motion
determined in Cor. 4.</p>

<p>COR. 6. And because the fluid endeavours to propagate its motion still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
farther, its impulse will carry the outmost cylinder also about with
it, unless the cylinder be violently detained; and accelerate its
motion till the periodic times of both cylinders become equal among
themselves. But if the outward cylinder be violently detained, it will
make an effort to retard the motion of the fluid; and unless the inward
cylinder preserve that motion by means of some external force impressed
thereon, it will make it cease by degrees.</p>

<p>All these things will be found true by making the experiment in deep

</figure>

<p>CASE 1. Let AFL be a sphere turning uniformly about the axis S, and let
the concentric circles BGM, CHN, DIO, EKP, &amp;c., divide the fluid into
innumerable concentric orbs of the same thickness. Suppose those orbs
to be solid; and, because the fluid is homogeneous, the impressions
which the contiguous orbs make one upon another will be (by the
supposition) as their translations from one another, and the contiguous
superficies upon which the impressions are made. If the impression upon
any orb be greater or less upon its concave than upon its convex side,
the more forcible impression will prevail, and will either accelerate
or retard the velocity of the orb, according as it is directed with
a conspiring or contrary motion to that of the orb. Therefore that
every orb may persevere uniformly in its motion, it is necessary that
the impressions made upon both sides of the orb should be equal, and
have contrary directions. Therefore since the impressions are as the
contiguous superficies, and as their translations from one another, the
translations will be inversely as the superficies, that is, inversely
as the squares of the distances of the superficies from the centre.
But the differences of the angular motions about the axis are as
those translations applied to the distances, or as the translations
directly and the distances inversely; that is, by compounding those
ratios, as the cubes of the distances inversely. Therefore if upon the
several parts of the infinite right line SABCDEQ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span> there be erected the
perpendiculars A<i>a</i>, B<i>b</i>, C<i>c</i>, D<i>d</i>, E<i>e</i>,
&amp;c., reciprocally proportional to the cubes of SA, SB, SC, SD, SE, &amp;c.,
the sums of the differences, that is, the whole angular motions will be
as the corresponding sums of the lines A<i>a</i>, B<i>b</i>, C<i>c</i>,
D<i>d</i>, E<i>e</i>, &amp;c., that is (if to constitute an uniformly
fluid medium the number of the orbs be increased and their thickness
diminished <i>in infinitum</i>), as the hyperbolic areas A<i>a</i>Q,
B<i>b</i>Q, C<i>c</i>Q, D<i>d</i>Q, E<i>e</i>Q, &amp;c., analogous to the
sums; and the periodic times being reciprocally proportional to the
angular motions, will be also reciprocally proportional to those areas.
Therefore the periodic time of any orb DIO is reciprocally as the area
D<i>d</i>Q, that is (by the known methods of quadratures), directly as
the square of the distance SD. Which was first to be demonstrated.</p>

<p>CASE 2. From the centre of the sphere let there be drawn a great number
of indefinite right lines, making given angles with the axis, exceeding
one another by equal differences; and, by these lines revolving about
the axis, conceive the orbs to be cut into innumerable annuli; then
will every annulus have four annuli contiguous to it, that is, one on
its inside, one on its outside, and two on each hand. Now each of these
annuli cannot be impelled equally and with contrary directions by the
attrition of the interior and exterior annuli, unless the motion be
communicated according to the law which we demonstrated in Case 1. This
appears from that demonstration. And therefore any series of annuli,
taken in any right line extending itself <i>in infinitum</i> from the
globe, will move according to the law of Case 1, except we should
imagine it hindered by the attrition of the annuli on each side of it.
But now in a motion, according to this law, no such is, and therefore
cannot be, any obstacle to the motions persevering according to that
law. If annuli at equal distances from the centre revolve either more
swiftly or more slowly near the poles than near the ecliptic, they
will be accelerated if slow, and retarded if swift, by their mutual
attrition; and so the periodic times will continually approach to
equality, according to the law of Case 1. Therefore this attrition will
not at all hinder the motion from going on according to the law of Case
1, and therefore that law will take place; that is, the periodic times
of the several annuli will be as the squares of their distances from
the centre of the globe. Which was to be demonstrated in the second
place.</p>

<p>CASE 3. Let now every annulus be divided by transverse sections into
innumerable particles constituting a substance absolutely and uniformly
fluid; and because these sections do not at all respect the law of
circular motion, but only serve to produce a fluid substance, the law
of circular motion will continue the same as before. All the very small
annuli will either not at all change their asperity and force of mutual
attrition upon account of these sections, or else they will change the
same equally. Therefore the proportion of the causes remaining the
same, the proportion of the effects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span> will remain the same also; that
is, the proportion of the motions and the periodic times. Q.E.D. But
now as the circular motion, and the centrifugal force thence arising,
is greater at the ecliptic than at the poles, there must be some cause
operating to retain the several particles in their circles; otherwise
the matter that is at the ecliptic will always recede from the centre,
and come round about to the poles by the outside of the vortex, and
from thence return by the axis to the ecliptic with a perpetual
circulation.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence the angular motions of the parts of the fluid about the
axis of the globe are reciprocally as the squares of the distances from
the centre of the globe, and the absolute velocities are reciprocally
as the same squares applied to the distances from the axis.</p>

<p>COR. 2. If a globe revolve with a uniform motion about an axis of
a given position in a similar and infinite quiescent fluid with an
uniform motion, it will communicate a whirling motion to the fluid like
that of a vortex, and that motion will by degrees be propagated onward
<i>in infinitum</i>; and this motion will be increased continually in
every part of the fluid, till the periodical times of the several parts
become as the squares of the distances from the centre of the globe.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Because the inward parts of the vortex are by reason of their
greater velocity continually pressing upon and driving forward the
external parts, and by that action are perpetually communicating motion
to them, and at the same time those exterior parts communicate the same
quantity of motion to those that lie still beyond them, and by this
action preserve the quantity of their motion continually unchanged, it
is plain that the motion is perpetually transferred from the centre
to the circumference of the vortex, till it is quite swallowed up and
lost in the boundless extent of that circumference. The matter between
any two spherical superficies concentrical to the vortex will never be
accelerated; because that matter will be always transferring the motion
it receives from the matter nearer the centre to that matter which lies
nearer the circumference.</p>

<p>COR. 4. Therefore, in order to continue a vortex in the same state of
motion, some active principle is required from which the globe may
receive continually the same quantity of motion which it is always
communicating to the matter of the vortex. Without such a principle
it will undoubtedly come to pass that the globe and the inward parts
of the vortex, being always propagating their motion to the outward
parts, and not receiving any new motion, will gradually move slower and
slower, and at last be carried round no longer.</p>

<p>COR. 5. If another globe should be swimming in the same vortex at a
certain distance from its centre, and in the mean time by some force
revolve constantly about an axis of a given inclination, the motion of
this globe will drive the fluid round after the manner of a vortex; and
at first this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span> new and small vortex will revolve with its globe about
the centre of the other; and in the mean time its motion will creep on
farther and farther, and by degrees be propagated <i>in infinitum</i>,
after the manner of the first vortex. And for the same reason that the
globe of the new vortex was carried about before by the motion of the
other vortex, the globe of this other will be carried about by the
motion of this new vortex, so that the two globes will revolve about
some intermediate point, and by reason of that circular motion mutually
fly from each other, unless some force restrains them. Afterward, if
the constantly impressed forces, by which the globes persevere in their
motions, should cease, and every thing be left to act according to the
laws of mechanics, the motion of the globes will languish by degrees
(for the reason assigned in Cor. 3 and 4), and the vortices at last
will quite stand still.</p>

<p>COR. 6. If several globes in given places should constantly revolve
with determined velocities about axes given in position, there would
arise from them as many vortices going on <i>in infinitum</i>. For
upon the same account that any one globe propagates its motion <i>in
infinitum</i>, each globe apart will propagate its own motion <i>in
infinitum</i> also; so that every part of the infinite fluid will be
agitated with a motion resulting from the actions of all the globes.
Therefore the vortices will not be confined by any certain limits, but
by degrees run mutually into each other; and by the mutual actions of
the vortices on each other, the globes will be perpetually moved from
their places, as was shewn in the last Corollary; neither can they
possibly keep any certain position among themselves, unless some force
restrains them. But if those forces, which are constantly impressed
upon the globes to continue these motions, should cease, the matter
(for the reason assigned in Cor. 3 and 4) will gradually stop, and
cease to move in vortices.</p>

<p>COR. 7. If a similar fluid be inclosed in a spherical vessel, and,
by the uniform rotation of a globe in its centre, is driven round
in a vortex; and the globe and vessel revolve the same way about
the same axis, and their periodical times be as the squares of the
semi-diameters; the parts of the fluid will not go on in their motions
without acceleration or retardation till their periodical times are
as the squares of their distances from the centre of the vortex. No
constitution of a vortex can be permanent but this.</p>

<p>COR. 8. If the vessel, the inclosed fluid, and the globe, retain this
motion, and revolve besides with a common angular motion about any
given axis, because the mutual attrition of the parts of the fluid is
not changed by this motion, the motions of the parts among each other
will not be changed; for the translations of the parts among themselves
depend upon this attrition. Any part will persevere in that motion
in which its attrition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span> on one side retards it just as much as its
attrition on the other side accelerates it.</p>

<p>COR. 9. Therefore if the vessel be quiescent, and the motion of the
globe be given, the motion of the fluid will be given. For conceive
a plane to pass through the axis of the globe, and to revolve with a
contrary motion; and suppose the sum of the time of this revolution
and of the revolution of the globe to be to the time of the revolution
of the globe as the square of the semi-diameter of the vessel to the
square of the semi-diameter of the globe; and the periodic times of the
parts of the fluid in respect of this plane will be as the squares of
their distances from the centre of the globe.</p>

<p>COR. 10. Therefore if the vessel moves about the same axis with the
globe, or with a given velocity about a different one, the motion of
the fluid will be given. For if from the whole system we take away the
angular motion of the vessel, all the motions will remain the same
among themselves as before, by Cor. 8, and those motions will be given
by Cor. 9.</p>

<p>COR. 11. If the vessel and the fluid are quiescent, and the globe
revolves with an uniform motion, that motion will be propagated by
degrees through the whole fluid to the vessel, and the vessel will
be carried round by it, unless violently detained; and the fluid
and the vessel will be continually accelerated till their periodic
times become equal to the periodic times of the globe. If the vessel
be either withheld by some force, or revolve with any constant and
uniform motion, the medium will come by little and little to the state
of motion defined in Cor. 8, 9, 10, nor will it ever persevere in any
other state. But if then the forces, by which the globe and vessel
revolve with certain motions, should cease, and the whole system be
left to act according to the mechanical laws, the vessel and globe,
by means of the intervening fluid, will act upon each other, and will
continue to propagate their motions through the fluid to each other,
till their periodic times become equal among themselves, and the whole
system revolves together like one solid body.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>In all these reasonings I suppose the fluid to consist of matter of
uniform density and fluidity; I mean, that the fluid is such, that a
globe placed any where therein may propagate with the same motion of
its own, at distances from itself continually equal, similar and equal
motions in the fluid in the same interval of time. The matter by its
circular motion endeavours to recede from the axis of the vortex, and
therefore presses all the matter that lies beyond. This pressure makes
the attrition greater, and the separation of the parts more difficult;
and by consequence diminishes the fluidity of the matter. Again; if
the parts of the fluid are in any one place denser or larger than in
the others, the fluidity will be less in that place, because there are
fewer superficies where the parts can be separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span> from each other.
In these cases I suppose the defect of the fluidity to be supplied
by the smoothness or softness of the parts, or some other condition;
otherwise the matter where it is less fluid will cohere more, and be
more sluggish, and therefore will receive the motion more slowly, and
propagate it farther than agrees with the ratio above assigned. If the
vessel be not spherical, the particles will move in lines not circular,
but answering to the figure of the vessel; and the periodic times will
be nearly as the squares of the mean distances from the centre. In the
parts between the centre and the circumference the motions will be
slower where the spaces are wide, and swifter where narrow; but yet
the particles will not tend to the circumference at all the more for
their greater swiftness; for they then describe arcs of less curvity,
and the conatus of receding from the centre is as much diminished by
the diminution of this curvature as it is augmented by the increase of
the velocity. As they go out of narrow into wide spaces, they recede a
little farther from the centre, but in doing so are retarded; and when
they come out of wide into narrow spaces, they are again accelerated;
and so each particle is retarded and accelerated by turns for ever.
These things will come to pass in a rigid vessel; for the state of
vortices in an infinite fluid is known by Cor. 6 of this Proposition.</p>

<p>I have endeavoured in this Proposition to investigate the properties
of vortices, that I might find whether the celestial phænomena can
be explained by them; for the phænomenon is this, that the periodic
times of the planets revolving about Jupiter are in the sesquiplicate
ratio of their distances from Jupiter's centre; and the same rule
obtains also among the planets that revolve about the sun. And these
rules obtain also with the greatest accuracy, as far as has been yet
discovered by astronomical observation. Therefore if those planets are
carried round in vortices revolving about Jupiter and the sun, the
vortices must revolve according to that law. But here we found the
periodic times of the parts of the vortex to be in the duplicate ratio
of the distances from the centre of motion; and this ratio cannot be
diminished and reduced to the sesquiplicate, unless either the matter
of the vortex be more fluid the farther it is from the centre, or the
resistance arising from the want of lubricity in the parts of the fluid
should, as the velocity with which the parts of the fluid are separated
goes on increasing, be augmented with it in a greater ratio than that
in which the velocity increases. But neither of these suppositions
seem reasonable. The more gross and less fluid parts will tend to the
circumference, unless they are heavy towards the centre. And though,
for the sake of demonstration, I proposed, at the beginning of this
Section, an Hypothesis that the resistance is proportional to the
velocity, nevertheless, it is in truth probable that the resistance
is in a less ratio than that of the velocity; which granted, the
periodic times of the parts of the vortex will be in a greater than
the duplicate ratio of the distances from its centre. If, as some
think, the vortices move more swiftly near the centre, then slower<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span> to
a certain limit, then again swifter near the circumference, certainly
neither the sesquiplicate, nor any other certain and determinate ratio,
can obtain in them. Let philosophers then see how that phænomenon of
the sesquiplicate ratio can be accounted for by vortices.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION LIII. THEOREM XLI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Bodies carried about in a vortex, and returning in the same orb, are
of the same density with the vortex, and are moved according to the
same law with the parts of the vortex, as to velocity and direction of
motion.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For if any small part of the vortex, whose particles or physical
points preserve a given situation among each other, be supposed to be
congealed, this particle will move according to the same law as before,
since no change is made either in its density, <i>vis insita</i>, or
figure. And again; if a congealed or solid part of the vortex be of
the same density with the rest of the vortex, and be resolved into a
fluid, this will move according to the same law as before, except in so
far as its particles, now become fluid, may be moved among themselves.
Neglect, therefore, the motion of the particles among themselves as not
at all concerning the progressive motion of the whole, and the motion
of the whole will be the same as before. But this motion will be the
same with the motion of other parts of the vortex at equal distances
from the centre; because the solid, now resolved into a fluid, is
become perfectly like to the other parts of the vortex. Therefore a
solid, if it be of the same density with the matter of the vortex,
will move with the same motion as the parts thereof, being relatively
at rest in the matter that surrounds it. If it be more dense, it will
endeavour more than before to recede from the centre; and therefore
overcoming that force of the vortex, by which, being, as it were, kept
in equilibrio, it was retained in its orbit, it will recede from the
centre, and in its revolution describe a spiral, returning no longer
into the same orbit. And, by the same argument, if it be more rare,
it will approach to the centre. Therefore it can never continually go
round in the same orbit, unless it be of the same density with the
fluid. But we have shewn in that case that it would revolve according
to the same law with those parts of the fluid that are at the same or
equal distances from the centre of the vortex.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore a solid revolving in a vortex, and continually going
round in the same orbit, is relatively quiescent in the fluid that
carries it.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And if the vortex be of an uniform density, the same body may
revolve at any distance from the centre of the vortex.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span></p>

<p>Hence it is manifest that the planets are not carried round in
corporeal vortices; for, according to the <i>Copernican</i> hypothesis,
the planets going round the sun revolve in ellipses, having the sun
in their common focus; and by radii drawn to the sun describe areas
proportional to the times. But now the parts of a vortex can never
revolve with such a motion. Let AD, BE, CF, represent three orbits
described about the sun S, of which let the utmost circle CF be
concentric to the sun; and let the aphelia of the two innermost be A,
B; and their perihelia D, E. Therefore a body revolving in the orb CF,
describing, by a radius drawn to the sun, areas proportional to the
times, will move with an uniform motion. And, according to the laws of
astronomy, the body revolving in the orb BE will move slower in its
aphelion B, and swifter in its perihelion E; whereas, according to the
laws of mechanics, the matter of the vortex ought to move more swiftly
in the narrow space between A and C than in the wide space between D
and F; that is, more swiftly in the aphelion than in the perihelion.
Now these two conclusions contradict each other. So at the beginning
of the sign of Virgo, where the aphelion of Mars is at present, the
distance between the orbits of Mars and Venus is to the distance
between the same orbits, at the beginning of the sign of Pisces, as
about 3 to 2; and therefore the matter of the vortex between those
orbits ought to be swifter at the beginning of Pisces than at the
beginning of Virgo in the ratio of 3 to 2; for the narrower the space
is through which the same quantity of matter passes in the same time of
one revolution, the greater will be the velocity with which it passes
through it. Therefore if the earth being relatively at rest in this
celestial matter should be carried round by it, and revolve together
with it about the sun, the velocity of the earth at the beginning
of Pisces would be to its velocity at the beginning of Virgo in a
sesquialteral ratio. Therefore the sun's apparent diurnal motion at the
beginning of Virgo ought to be above 70 minutes, and at the beginning
of Pisces less than 48 minutes; whereas, on the contrary, that apparent
motion of the sun is really greater at the beginning of Pisces than
at the beginning of Virgo, as experience testifies; and therefore the
earth is swifter at the beginning of Virgo than at the beginning of
Pisces; so that the hypothesis of vortices is utterly irreconcileable
with astronomical phænomena, and rather serves to perplex than explain
the heavenly motions. How these motions are performed in free spaces
without vortices, may be understood by the first Book; and I shall now
more fully treat of it in the following Book.</p>

<p>IN the preceding Books I have laid down the principles of philosophy,
principles not philosophical, but mathematical: such, to wit, as we may
build our reasonings upon in philosophical inquiries. These principles
are the laws and conditions of certain motions, and powers or forces,
which chiefly have respect to philosophy; but, lest they should have
appeared of themselves dry and barren, I have illustrated them here
and there with some philosophical scholiums, giving an account of
such things as are of more general nature, and which philosophy seems
chiefly to be founded on; such as the density and the resistance of
bodies, spaces void of all bodies, and the motion of light and sounds.
It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame
of the System of the World. Upon this subject I had, indeed, composed
the third Book in a popular method, that it might be read by many;
but afterward, considering that such as had not sufficiently entered
into the principles could not easily discern the strength of the
consequences, nor lay aside the prejudices to which they had been many
years accustomed, therefore, to prevent the disputes which might be
raised upon such accounts, I chose to reduce the substance of this Book
into the form of Propositions (in the mathematical way), which should
be read by those only who had first made themselves masters of the
principles established in the preceding Books: not that I would advise
any one to the previous study of every Proposition of those Books; for
they abound with such as might cost too much time, even to readers of
good mathematical learning. It is enough if one carefully reads the
Definitions, the Laws of Motion, and the first three Sections of the
first Book. He may then pass on to this Book, and consult such of the
remaining Propositions of the first two Books, as the references in
this, and his occasions, shall require.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RULES_OF_REASONING_IN_PHILOSOPHY">RULES OF REASONING IN PHILOSOPHY.</h2>
</div>


<p class="nindc space-above2">RULE I.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>We are to admit no more causes of natural things than such as are
both true and sufficient to explain their appearances.</i></p>
</div>

<p>To this purpose the philosophers say that Nature does nothing in vain,
and more is in vain when less will serve; for Nature is pleased with
simplicity, and affects not the pomp of superfluous causes.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">RULE II.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Therefore to the same natural effects we must, as far as possible,
assign the same causes.</i></p>
</div>

<p>As to respiration in a man and in a beast; the descent of stones in
<i>Europe</i> and in <i>America</i>; the light of our culinary fire and
of the sun; the reflection of light in the earth, and in the planets.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">RULE III.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The qualities of bodies, which admit neither intension nor remission
of degrees, and which are found to belong to all bodies within the
reach of our experiments, are to be esteemed the universal qualities of
all bodies whatsoever.</i></p>
</div>

<p>For since the qualities of bodies are only known to us by experiments,
we are to hold for universal all such as universally agree with
experiments; and such as are not liable to diminution can never be
quite taken away. We are certainly not to relinquish the evidence
of experiments for the sake of dreams and vain fictions of our own
devising; nor are we to recede from the analogy of Nature, which uses
to be simple, and always consonant to itself. We no other way know the
extension of bodies than by our senses, nor do these reach it in all
bodies; but because we perceive extension in all that are sensible,
therefore we ascribe it universally to all others also. That abundance
of bodies are hard, we learn by experience; and because the hardness of
the whole arises from the hardness of the parts, we therefore justly
infer the hardness of the undivided particles not only of the bodies
we feel but of all others. That all bodies are impenetrable, we gather
not from reason, but from sensation. The bodies which we handle we find
impenetrable, and thence conclude impenetrability to be an universal
property of all bodies whatsoever. That all bodies are moveable, and
endowed with certain powers (which we call the <i>vires inertiæ</i>)
of persevering in their motion, or in their rest, we only infer from
the like properties observed in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span> bodies which we have seen. The
extension, hardness, impenetrability, mobility, and <i>vis inertiæ</i>
of the whole, result from the extension, hardness, impenetrability,
mobility, and <i>vires inertiæ</i> of the parts; and thence we conclude
the least particles of all bodies to be also all extended, and hard
and impenetrable, and moveable, and endowed with their proper <i>vires
inertiæ</i>. And this is the foundation of all philosophy. Moreover,
that the divided but contiguous particles of bodies may be separated
from one another, is matter of observation; and, in the particles
that remain undivided, our minds are able to distinguish yet lesser
parts, as is mathematically demonstrated. But whether the parts so
distinguished, and not yet divided, may, by the powers of Nature, be
actually divided and separated from one another, we cannot certainly
determine. Yet, had we the proof of but one experiment that any
undivided particle, in breaking a hard and solid body, suffered a
division, we might by virtue of this rule conclude that the undivided
as well as the divided particles may be divided and actually separated
to infinity.</p>

<p>Lastly, if it universally appears, by experiments and astronomical
observations, that all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the
earth, and that in proportion to the quantity of matter which they
severally contain: that the moon likewise, according to the quantity
of its matter, gravitates towards the earth; that, on the other hand,
our sea gravitates towards the moon; and all the planets mutually one
towards another; and the comets in like manner towards the sun; we
must, in consequence of this rule, universally allow that all bodies
whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation. For
the argument from the appearances concludes with more force for the
universal gravitation of all bodies than for their impenetrability; of
which, among those in the celestial regions, we have no experiments,
nor any manner of observation. Not that I affirm gravity to be
essential to bodies: by their <i>vis insita</i> I mean nothing
but their <i>vis inertiæ</i>, This is immutable. Their gravity is
diminished as they recede from the earth.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">RULE IV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>In experimental philosophy we are to look upon propositions
collected by general induction from phænomena as accurately or very
nearly true, notwithstanding any contrary hypotheses that may be
imagined, till such time as other phænomena occur, by which they may
either be made more accurate, or liable to exceptions.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span></p>

evaded by hypotheses.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Pound</i> has determined, by the help of excellent micrometers,
the diameters of Jupiter and the elongation of its satellites after the
following manner. The greatest heliocentric elongation of the fourth
satellite from Jupiter's centre was taken with a micrometer in a 15
feet telescope, and at the mean distance of Jupiter from the earth was
found about 8' 16''. The elongation of the third satellite was taken
with a micrometer in a telescope of 123 feet, and at the same distance
of Jupiter from the earth was found 4' 42''. The greatest elongations
of the other satellites, at the same distance of Jupiter from the
earth, are found from the periodic times to be 2' 56'' 47''', and 1'
51'' 6'''.</p>

<p>The diameter of Jupiter taken with the micrometer in a 123 feet
telescope several times, and reduced to Jupiter's mean distance
from the earth, proved always less than 40'', never less than 38'',
generally 39''. This diameter in shorter telescopes is 40'', or 41'';
for Jupiter's light is a little dilated by the unequal refrangibility
of the rays, and this dilatation bears a less ratio to the diameter of
Jupiter in the longer and more perfect telescopes than in those which
are shorter and less perfect. The times in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span> which two satellites, the
first and the third, passed over Jupiter's body, were observed, from
the beginning of the ingress to the beginning of the egress, and from
the complete ingress to the complete egress, with the long telescope.
And from the transit of the first satellite, the diameter of Jupiter at
its mean distance from the earth came forth <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="37\tfrac{1}{8}''" src="images/955.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.051ex;" id="img_images_955.svg">,</span> and
from the transit of the third <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="37\tfrac{3}{8}''" src="images/956.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.049ex;" id="img_images_956.svg">.</span> There was observed
also the time in which the shadow of the first satellite passed over
Jupiter's body, and thence the diameter of Jupiter at its mean distance
from the earth came out about 37''. Let us suppose its diameter to be

<p>The greatest elongation of the fourth satellite from Saturn's centre
is commonly determined from the observations to be eight of these
semi-diameters very nearly. But the greatest elongation of this
satellite from Saturn's centre, when taken with an excellent micrometer
in Mr. <i>Huygens'</i> telescope of 123 feet, appeared to be eight
semi-diameters and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{7}{10}" src="images/960.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_960.svg"> of a semi-diameter. And from this
observation and the periodic times the distances of the satellites from
Saturn's centre in semi-diameters of the ring are 2,1. 2,69. 3,75. 8,7.

found to be to the diameter of the ring as 3 to 7; and the diameter
of the ring, <i>May 28-29, 1719</i>, was found to be 43''; and thence
the diameter of the ring when Saturn is at its mean distance from the
earth is 42'', and the diameter of Saturn 18''. These things appear so
in very long and excellent telescopes, because in such telescopes the
apparent magnitudes of the heavenly bodies bear a greater proportion
to the dilatation of light in the extremities of those bodies than in
shorter telescopes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span> If we, then, reject all the spurious light, the

<p>As to Mercury and Venus, there can be no doubt about their distances
from the sun; for they are determined by the elongations of those
planets from the sun; and for the distances of the superior planets,
all dispute is cut off by the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter.
For by those eclipses the position of the shadow which Jupiter projects
is determined; whence we have the heliocentric longitude of Jupiter.
And from its heliocentric and geocentric longitudes compared together,
we determine its distance.</p>

distances, so as to maintain an equality in the description of the
areas. This a noted proposition among astronomers, and particularly
demonstrable in Jupiter, from the eclipses of his satellites; by the

<p>The former part of the Proposition is manifest from Phæn. V, and Prop.

of the same Book. But this part of the Proposition is, with great
accuracy, demonstrable from the quiescence of the aphelion points; for
a very small aberration from the <i>reciprocal</i> duplicate proportion
would (by Cor. 1, Prop. XLV, Book I) produce a motion of the apsides
sensible enough in every single revolution, and in many of them
enormously great.</p>

<p>The former part of the Proposition is evident from Phæn. VI, and
Prop. II or III, Book I; the latter from the very slow motion of
the moon's apogee; which in every single revolution amounting but
to 3° 3' <i>in consequentia</i>, may be neglected. For (by Cor. 1,
Prop. XLV, Book I) it appears, that, if the distance of the moon
from the earth's centre is to the semi-diameter of the earth as D to
1, the force, from which such a motion will result, is reciprocally
as <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm{D}^{2}\tfrac{4}{243}" src="images/961.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 6.111ex; height: 2.79ex;" id="img_images_961.svg">,</span> i. e., reciprocally as the

duplicate than to the triplicate proportion. But in regard that this
motion is owing to the action of the sun (as we shall afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
shew), it is here to be neglected. The action of the sun, attracting
the moon from the earth, is nearly as the moon's distance from the
earth; and therefore (by what we have shewed in Cor. 2, Prop. XLV,
Book I) is to the centripetal force of the moon as 2 to 357,45, or
nearly so; that is, as 1 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="178\tfrac{29}{40}" src="images/963.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_963.svg">.</span> And if we neglect so
inconsiderable a force of the sun, the remaining force, by which the
moon is retained in its orb, will be reciprocally as D<sup>2</sup>. This will yet
more fully appear from comparing this force with the force of gravity,
as is done in the next Proposition.</p>

<p>COR. If we augment the mean centripetal force by which the moon is

assume the mean distance of 60 diameters in the syzygies; and suppose

as the French have found by mensuration. And now if we imagine the
moon, deprived of all motion, to be let go, so as to descend towards
the earth with the impulse of all that force by which (by Cor. Prop.

we gather by a calculus, founded either upon Prop. XXXVI, Book I, or
(which comes to the same thing) upon Cor. 9, Prop. IV, of the same
Book. For the versed sine of that arc, which the moon, in the space of
one minute of time, would by its mean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</span> motion describe at the distance
of 60 semi-diameters of the earth, is nearly <img alt="" data-tex="15\tfrac{1}{12}" src="images/969.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_969.svg_1">

the earth, increases in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the
distance, and, upon that account, at the surface of the earth, is 60 ×
60 times greater than at the moon, a body in our regions, falling with
that force, ought in the space of one minute of time, to describe <img alt="" data-tex="60 \times\, 60 \times\, 15\tfrac{1}{12}" src="images/971.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 15.67ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_971.svg"> <i>Paris</i> feet; and, in the

And with this very force we actually find that bodies here upon
earth do really descend; for a pendulum oscillating seconds in the
latitude of <i>Paris</i> will be 3 <i>Paris</i> feet, and 8 lines
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/643.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_643.svg_15"> in length, as Mr. <i>Huygens</i> has observed. And
the space which a heavy body describes by falling in one second of
time is to half the length of this pendulum in the duplicate ratio of
the circumference of a circle to its diameter (as Mr. <i>Huygens</i>
has also shewn), and is therefore 15 <i>Paris</i> feet, 1 inch, 1
line <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{7}{9}" src="images/972.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_972.svg">.</span> And therefore the force by which the moon is
retained in its orbit becomes, at the very surface of the earth, equal
to the force of gravity which we observe in heavy bodies there. And
therefore (by Rule I and II) the force by which the moon is retained in
its orbit is that very same force which we commonly call gravity; for,
were gravity another force different from that, then bodies descending
to the earth with the joint impulse of both forces would fall with a
double velocity, and in the space of one second of time would describe
<img alt="" data-tex="30\tfrac{1}{6}" src="images/973.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_973.svg"> <i>Paris</i> feet; altogether against experience.</p>

<p>This calculus is founded on the hypothesis of the earth's standing
still; for if both earth and moon move about the sun, and at the same
time about their common centre of gravity, the distance of the centres
of the moon and earth from one another will be <img alt="" data-tex="60\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/968.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_968.svg_1">
semi-diameters of the earth; as may be found by a computation from
Prop. LX, Book I.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>The demonstration of this Proposition may be more diffusely explained
after the following manner. Suppose several moons to revolve about the
earth, as in the system of Jupiter or Saturn; the periodic times of
these moons (by the argument of induction) would observe the same law
which <i>Kepler</i> found to obtain among the planets; and therefore
their centripetal forces would be reciprocally as the squares of the
distances from the centre of the earth, by Prop. I, of this Book. Now
if the lowest of these were very small, and were so near the earth as
almost to touch the tops of the highest mountains, the centripetal
force thereof, retaining it in its orb, would be very nearly equal
to the weights of any <i>terrestrial</i> bodies that should be found
upon the tops of those mountains, as may be known by the foregoing
computation. Therefore if the same little moon should be deserted by
its centrifugal force that carries it through its orb, and so be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
disabled from going onward therein, it would descend to the earth; and
that with the same velocity as heavy bodies do actually fall with upon
the tops of those very mountains; because of the equality of the forces
that oblige them both to descend. And if the force by which that lowest
moon would descend were different from gravity, and if that moon were
to gravitate towards the earth, as we find terrestrial bodies do upon
the tops of mountains, it would then descend with twice the velocity,
as being impelled by both these forces conspiring together. Therefore
since both these forces, that is, the gravity of heavy bodies, and the
centripetal forces of the moons, respect the centre of the earth, and
are similar and equal between themselves, they will (by Rule I and II)
have one and the same cause. And therefore the force which retains the
moon in its orbit is that very force which we commonly call gravity;
because otherwise this little moon at the top of a mountain must either
be without gravity, or fall twice as swiftly as heavy bodies are wont
to do.</p>

force of gravity does in receding from the earth.</p>

<p>COR. 1. There is, therefore, a power of gravity tending to all the
planets; for, doubtless, Venus, Mercury, and the rest, are bodies of
the same sort with Jupiter and Saturn. And since all attraction (by Law
III) is mutual, Jupiter will therefore gravitate towards all his own
satellites, Saturn towards his, the earth towards the moon, and the sun
towards all the primary planets.</p>

<p>COR. 2. The force of gravity which tends to any one planet is
reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from that planet's
centre.</p>

<p>COR. 3. All the planets do mutually gravitate towards one another, by
Cor. 1 and 2. And hence it is that Jupiter and Saturn, when near their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span>
conjunction, by their mutual attractions sensibly disturb each other's
motions. So the sun disturbs the motions of the moon; and both sun and
moon disturb our sea, as we shall hereafter explain.</p>

<p>The force which retains the celestial bodies in their orbits has been
hitherto called centripetal force; but it being now made plain that it
can be no other than a gravitating force, we shall hereafter call it
gravity. For the cause of that centripetal force which retains the moon
in its orbit will extend itself to all the planets, by Rule I, II, and
IV.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION VI. THEOREM VI.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>That all bodies gravitate towards every planet; and that the weights
of bodies towards any the same planet, at equal distances from the
centre of the planet, are proportional to the quantities of matter
which they severally contain.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It has been, now of a long time, observed by others, that all sorts of
heavy bodies (allowance being made for the inequality of retardation
which they suffer from a small power of resistance in the air) descend
to the earth <i>from equal heights</i> in equal times; and that
equality of times we may distinguish to a great accuracy, by the help
of pendulums. I tried the thing in gold, silver, lead, glass, sand,
common salt, wood, water, and wheat. I provided two wooden boxes,
round and equal: I filled the one with wood, and suspended an equal
weight of gold (as exactly as I could) in the centre of oscillation
of the other. The boxes hanging by equal threads of 11 feet made a
couple of pendulums perfectly equal in weight and figure, and equally
receiving the resistance of the air. And, placing the one by the other,
I observed them to play together forward and backward, for a long
time, with equal vibrations. And therefore the quantity of matter in
the gold (by Cor. 1 and 6, Prop. XXIV, Book II) was to the quantity
of matter in the wood as the action of the motive force (or <i>vis
motrix</i>) upon all the gold to the action of the same upon all the
wood; that is, as the weight of the one to the weight of the other: and
the like happened in the other bodies. By these experiments, in bodies
of the same weight, I could manifestly have discovered a difference of
matter less than the thousandth part of the whole, had any such been.
But, without all doubt, the nature of gravity towards the planets is
the same as towards the earth. For, should we imagine our terrestrial
bodies removed to the orb of the moon, and there, together with the
moon, deprived of all motion, to be let go, so as to fall together
towards the earth, it is certain, from what we have demonstrated
before, that, in equal times, they would describe equal spaces with the
moon, and of consequence are to the moon, in quantity of matter, as
their weights to its weight. Moreover, since the satellites of Jupiter
perform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span> their revolutions in times which observe the sesquiplicate
proportion of their distances from Jupiter's centre, their accelerative
gravities towards Jupiter will be reciprocally as the squares of their
distances from Jupiter's centre; that is, equal, at equal distances.
And, therefore, these satellites, if supposed to fall <i>towards
Jupiter</i> from equal heights, would describe equal spaces in equal
times, in like manner as heavy bodies do on our earth. And, by the same
argument, if the circumsolar planets were supposed to be let fall at
equal distances from the sun, they would, in their descent towards the
sun, describe equal spaces in equal times. But forces which equally
accelerate unequal bodies must be as those bodies: that is to say,
the weights of the planets <i>towards the sun</i> must be as their
quantities of matter. Further, that the weights of Jupiter and of his
satellites towards the sun are proportional to the several quantities
of their matter, appears from the exceedingly regular motions of the
satellites (by Cor. 3, Prop. LXV, Book I). For if some of those bodies
were more strongly attracted to the sun in proportion to their quantity
of matter than others, the motions of the satellites would be disturbed
by that inequality of attraction (by Cor. 2, Prop. LXV, Book I). If,
at equal distances from the sun, any satellite, in proportion to the
quantity of its matter, did gravitate towards the sun with a force
greater than Jupiter in proportion to his, according to any given
proportion, suppose of <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>; then the distance between
the centres of the sun and of the satellite's orbit would be always
greater than the distance between the centres of the sun and of Jupiter
nearly in the subduplicate of that proportion: as by some computations
I have found. And if the satellite did gravitate towards the sun with a
force, lesser in the proportion of <i>e</i> to <i>d</i>, the distance
of the centre of the satellite's orb from the sun would be less than
the distance of the centre of Jupiter from the sun in the subduplicate
of the same proportion. Therefore if, at equal distances from the sun,
the accelerative gravity of any satellite towards the sun were greater
or less than the accelerative gravity of Jupiter towards the sun but by
one <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{1000}" src="images/974.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_974.svg"> part of the whole gravity, the distance of the
centre of the satellite's orbit from the sun would be greater or less
than the distance of Jupiter from the sun by one <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2000}" src="images/975.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_975.svg">
part of the whole distance; that is, by a fifth part of the distance of
the utmost satellite from the centre of Jupiter; an eccentricity of the
orbit which would be very sensible. But the orbits of the satellites
are concentric to Jupiter, and therefore the accelerative gravities of
Jupiter, and of all its satellites towards the sun, are equal among
themselves. And by the same argument, the weights of Saturn and of his
satellites towards the sun, at equal distances from the sun, are as
their several quantities of matter; and the weights of the moon and of
the earth towards the sun are either none, or accurately proportional
to the masses of matter which they contain. But some they are, by Cor.
1 and 3, Prop. V.</p>

<p>But further; the weights of all the parts of every planet towards
any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span> planet are one to another as the matter in the several
parts; for if some parts did gravitate more, others less, than for
the quantity of their matter, then the whole planet, according to the
sort of parts with which it most abounds, would gravitate more or less
than in proportion to the quantity of matter in the whole. Nor is it
of any moment whether these parts are external or internal; for if,
for example, we should imagine the terrestrial bodies with us to be
raised up to the orb of the moon, to be there compared with its body:
if the weights of such bodies were to the weights of the external parts
of the moon as the quantities of matter in the one and in the other
respectively; but to the weights of the internal parts in a greater or
less proportion, then likewise the weights of those bodies would be to
the weight of the whole moon in a greater or less proportion; against
what we have shewed above.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence the weights of bodies do not depend upon their forms and
textures; for if the weights could be altered with the forms, they
would be greater or less, according to the variety of forms, in equal
matter; altogether against experience.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Universally, all bodies about the earth gravitate towards the
earth; and the weights of all, at equal distances from the earth's
centre, are as the quantities of matter which they severally contain.
This is the quality of all bodies within the reach of our experiments;
and therefore (by Rule III) to be affirmed of all bodies whatsoever.
If the <i>æther</i>, or any other body, were either altogether void
of gravity, or were to gravitate less in proportion to its quantity
of matter, then, because (according to <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Des
Cartes</i>, and others) there is no difference betwixt that and other
bodies but in <i>mere</i> form of matter, by a successive change from
form to form, it might be changed at last into a body of the same
condition with those which gravitate most in proportion to their
quantity of matter; and, on the other hand, the heaviest bodies,
acquiring the first form of that body, might by degrees quite lose
their gravity. And therefore the weights would depend upon the forms
of bodies, and with those forms might be changed: contrary to what was
proved in the preceding Corollary.</p>

<p>COR. 3. All spaces are not equally full; for if all spaces were equally
full, then the specific gravity of the fluid which fills the region of
the air, on account of the extreme density of the matter, would fall
nothing short of the specific gravity of quicksilver, or gold, or any
other the most dense body; and, therefore, neither gold, nor any other
body, could descend in air; for bodies do not descend in fluids, unless
they are specifically heavier than the fluids. And if the quantity of
matter in a given space can, by any rarefaction, be diminished, what
should hinder a diminution to infinity?</p>

<p>COR. 4. If all the solid particles of all bodies are of the same
density, nor can be rarefied without pores, a void, space, or vacuum
must be granted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span> By bodies of the same density, I mean those whose
<i>vires inertiæ</i> are in the proportion of their bulks.</p>

<p>COR. 5. The power of gravity is of a different nature from the power of
magnetism; for the magnetic attraction is not as the matter attracted.
Some bodies are attracted more by the magnet; others less; most bodies
not at all. The power of magnetism in one and the same body may be
increased and diminished; and is sometimes far stronger, for the
quantity of matter, than the power of gravity; and in receding from
the magnet decreases not in the duplicate but almost in the triplicate
proportion of the distance, as nearly as I could judge from some rude
observations.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION VII. THEOREM VII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional

<p>That all the planets mutually gravitate one towards another, we have
proved before; as well as that the force of gravity towards every
one of them, considered apart, is reciprocally as the square of the
distance of places from the centre of the planet. And thence (by Prop.
LXIX, Book I, and its Corollaries) it follows, that the gravity tending
towards all the planets is proportional to the matter which they
contain.</p>

<p>Moreover, since all the parts of any planet A gravitate towards any
other planet B; and the gravity of every part is to the gravity of the
whole as the matter of the part to the matter of the whole; and (by
Law III) to every action corresponds an equal re-action; therefore
the planet B will, on the other hand, gravitate towards all the parts
of the planet A; and its gravity towards any one part will be to the
gravity towards the whole as the matter of the part to the matter of
the whole. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore the force of gravity towards any whole planet arises
from, and is compounded of, the forces of gravity towards all its
parts. Magnetic and electric attractions afford us examples of this;
for all attraction towards the whole arises from the attractions
towards the several parts. The thing may be easily understood in
gravity, if we consider a greater planet, as formed of a number of
lesser planets, meeting together in one globe; for <i>hence it would
appear that</i> the force of the whole must arise from the forces
of the component parts. If it is objected, that, according to this
law, all bodies with us must mutually gravitate one towards another,
whereas no such gravitation any where appears, I answer, that since
the gravitation towards these bodies is to the gravitation towards the
whole earth as these bodies are to the whole earth, the gravitation
towards them must be far less than to fall under the observation of our
senses.</p>

<p>COR. 2. The force of gravity towards the several equal particles of any
body is reciprocally as the square of the distance of places from the
particles; as appears from Cor. 3, Prop. LXXIV, Book I.</p>

</div>

<p>After I had found that the force of gravity towards a whole planet did
arise from and was compounded of the forces of gravity towards all its
parts, and towards every one part was in the reciprocal proportion of
the squares of the distances from the part, I was yet in doubt whether
that reciprocal duplicate proportion did accurately hold, or but nearly
so, in the total force compounded of so many partial ones; for it might
be that the proportion which accurately enough took place in greater
distances should be wide of the truth near the surface of the planet,
where the distances of the particles are unequal, and their situation
dissimilar. But by the help of Prop. LXXV and LXXVI, Book I, and their
Corollaries, I was at last satisfied of the truth of the Proposition,
as it now lies before us.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence we may find and compare together the weights of bodies
towards different planets; for the weights of bodies revolving in
circles about planets are (by Cor. 2, Prop. IV, Book I) as the
diameters of the circles directly, and the squares of their periodic
times reciprocally; and their weights at the surfaces of the planets,
or at any other distances from their centres, are (by this Prop.)
greater or less in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the
distances. Thus from the periodic times of Venus, revolving about
the sun, in 224<sup>d</sup>. <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{3}{4}^{h}." src="images/976.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.796ex; height: 3.229ex;" id="img_images_976.svg">,</span> of the utmost circumjovial

and of the moon about the earth in 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43'; compared with the
mean distance of Venus from the sun, and with the greatest heliocentric

centre, 8' 16''; of the Huygenian satellite from the centre of Saturn,
3' 4''; and of the moon from the earth, 10' 33'': by computation I
found that the weight of equal bodies, at equal distances from the
centres of the sun, of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of the earth, towards
the sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, were one to another, as 1,
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{1067}" src="images/979.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_979.svg">,</span> <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{3021}" src="images/980.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_980.svg">,</span> and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{169282}" src="images/981.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_981.svg">
respectively. Then because as the distances are increased or
diminished, the weights are diminished or increased in a duplicate
ratio, the weights of equal bodies towards the sun, Jupiter, Saturn,
and the earth, at the distances 10000, 997, 791, and 109 from their
centres, that is, at their very superficies, will be as 10000, 943,
529, and 435 respectively. How much the weights of bodies are at the
superficies of the moon, will be shewn hereafter.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Hence likewise we discover the quantity of matter in the
several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span> planets; for their quantities of matter are as the forces
of gravity at equal distances from their centres; that is, in the
sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, as 1, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{1067}" src="images/979.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_979.svg_1">,</span>

If the
parallax of the sun be taken greater or less than 10'' 30''', the
quantity of matter in the earth must be augmented or diminished in the
triplicate of that proportion.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Hence also we find the densities of the planets; for (by Prop.
LXXII, Book I) the weights of equal and similar bodies towards similar
spheres are, at the surfaces of those spheres, as the diameters of the
spheres; and therefore the densities of dissimilar spheres are as those
weights applied to the diameters of the spheres. But the true diameters
of the Sun, Jupiter, Saturn, and the earth, were one to another as
10000, 997, 791, and 109; and the weights towards the same as 10000,
943, 529, and 435 respectively; and therefore their densities are as
100, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="94\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/982.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_982.svg">,</span> 67, and 400. The density of the earth, which
comes out by this computation, does not depend upon the parallax of
the sun, but is determined by the parallax of the moon, and therefore
is here truly defined. The sun, therefore, is a little denser than
Jupiter, and Jupiter than Saturn, and the earth four times denser
than the sun; for the sun, by its great heat, is kept in a sort of a
rarefied state. The moon is denser than the earth, as shall appear
afterward.</p>

<p>COR. 4. The smaller the planets are, they are, <i>cæteris paribus</i>,
of so much the greater density; for so the powers of gravity on their
several surfaces come nearer to equality. They are likewise, <i>cæteris
paribus</i>, of the greater density, as they are nearer to the sun.
So Jupiter is more dense than Saturn, and the earth than Jupiter; for
the planets were to be placed at different distances from the sun,
that, according to their degrees of density, they might enjoy a greater
or less proportion to the sun's heat. Our water, if it were removed
as far as the orb of Saturn, would be converted into ice, and in the
orb of Mercury would quickly fly away in vapour; for the light of the
sun, to which its heat is proportional, is seven times denser in the
orb of Mercury than with us: and by the thermometer I have found that
a sevenfold heat of our summer sun will make water boil. Nor are we
to doubt that the matter of Mercury is adapted to its heat, and is
therefore more dense than the matter of our earth; since, in a denser
matter, the operations of Nature require a stronger heat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>That the motions of the planets in the heavens may subsist an
exceedingly long time.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the Scholium of Prop. XL, Book II, I have shewed that a globe of
water frozen into ice, and moving freely in our air, in the time that
it would describe the length of its semi-diameter, would lose by the
resistance of the air <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4586}" src="images/918.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.195ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_918.svg_1"> part of its motion; and the
same proportion holds nearly in all globes, how great soever, and moved
with whatever velocity. But that our globe of earth is of greater
density than it would be if the whole consisted of water only, I thus
make out. If the whole consisted of water only, whatever was of less
density than water, because of its less specific gravity, would emerge
and float above. And upon this account, if a globe of terrestrial
matter, covered on all sides with water, was less dense than water, it
would emerge somewhere; and, the subsiding water falling back, would be
gathered to the opposite side. And such is the condition of our earth,
which in a great measure is covered with seas. The earth, if it was not
for its greater density, would emerge from the seas, and, according
to its degree of levity, would be raised more or less above their
surface, the water of the seas flowing backward to the opposite side.
By the same argument, the spots of the sun, which float upon the lucid
matter thereof, are lighter than that matter; and, however the planets
have been formed while they were yet in fluid masses, all the heavier
matter subsided to the centre. Since, therefore, the common matter of
our earth on the surface thereof is about twice as heavy as water, and
a little lower, in mines, is found about three, or four, or even five
times more heavy, it is probable that the quantity of the whole matter
of the earth may be five or six times greater than if it consisted all
of water; especially since I have before shewed that the earth is about
four times more dense than Jupiter. If, therefore, Jupiter is a little
more dense than water, in the space of thirty days, in which that
planet describes the length of 459 of its semi-diameters, it would, in
a medium of the same density with our air, lose almost a tenth part of
its motion. But since the resistance of mediums decreases in proportion
to their weight or density, so that water, which is <img alt="" data-tex="13\tfrac{3}{5}" src="images/983.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_983.svg">
times lighter than quicksilver, resists less in that proportion; and
air, which is 860 times lighter than water, resists less in the same
proportion; therefore in the heavens, where the weight of the medium
in which the planets move is immensely diminished, the resistance will
almost vanish.</p>

<p>It is shewn in the Scholium of Prop. XXII, Book II, that at the height
of 200 miles above the earth the air is more rare than it is at the
superficies of the earth in the ratio of 30 to 0,0000000000003998,
or as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span> 75000000000000 to 1 nearly. And hence the planet Jupiter,
revolving in a medium of the same density with that superior air, would
not lose by the resistance of the medium the 1000000th part of its
motion in 1000000 years. In the spaces near the earth the resistance
is produced only by the air, exhalations, and vapours. When these are
carefully exhausted by the air-pump from under the receiver, heavy
bodies fall within the receiver with perfect freedom, and without the
least sensible resistance: gold itself, and the lightest down, let
fall together, will descend with equal velocity; and though they fall
through a space of four, six, and eight feet, they will come to the
bottom at the same time; as appears from experiments. And therefore
the celestial regions being perfectly void of air and exhalations, the
planets and comets meeting no sensible resistance in those spaces will
continue their motions through them for an immense tract of time.</p>

Jupiter from the sun is to the semi-diameter of the sun in a proportion

pursuing the principles of this computation, we should find that though
the earth and all the planets were placed on one side of the sun, the
distance of the common centre of gravity of all from the centre of the
sun would scarcely amount to one diameter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span> the sun. In other cases,
the distances of those centres are always less; and therefore, since
that centre of gravity is in perpetual rest, the sun, according to the
various positions of the planets, must perpetually be moved every way,
but will never recede far from that centre.</p>

<p>COR. Hence the common centre of gravity of the earth, the sun, and all
the planets, is to be esteemed the centre of the world; for since the
earth, the sun, and all the planets, mutually gravitate one towards
another, and are therefore, according to their powers of gravity,
in perpetual agitation, as the Laws of Motion require, it is plain
that their moveable centres cannot be taken for the immovable centre
of the world. If that body were to be placed in the centre, towards
which other bodies gravitate most (according to common opinion), that
privilege ought to be allowed to the sun; but since the sun itself is
moved, a fixed point is to be chosen from which the centre of the sun
recedes least, and from which it would recede yet less if the body of
the sun were denser and greater, and therefore less apt to be moved.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The planets move in ellipses which have their common focus in the
centre of the sun; and, by radii drawn, to that centre, they describe
areas proportional to the times of description.</i></p>
</div>

<p>We have discoursed above of these motions from the Phænomena. Now that
we know the principles on which they depend, from those principles we
deduce the motions of the heavens <i>à priori</i>. Because the weights
of the planets towards the sun are reciprocally as the squares of their
distances from the sun's centre, if the sun was at rest, and the other
planets did not mutually act one upon another, their orbits would be
ellipses, having the sun in their common focus; and they would describe
areas proportional to the times <i>of description</i>, by Prop. I and
XI, and Cor. 1, Prop. XIII, Book I. But the mutual actions of the
planets one upon another are so very small, that they may be neglected;
and by Prop. LXVI, Book I, they less disturb the motions of the planets
around the sun in motion than if those motions were performed about the
sun at rest.</p>

<p>It is true, that the action of Jupiter upon Saturn is not to be
neglected: for the force of gravity towards Jupiter is to the force
of gravity towards the sun (at equal distances, Cor. 2, Prop. VIII)
as 1 to 1067; and therefore in the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn,
because the distance of Saturn from Jupiter is to the distance of
Saturn from the sun almost as 4 to 9, the gravity of Saturn towards
Jupiter will be to the gravity of Saturn towards the sun as 81 to 16
× 1067; or, as 1 to about 211. And hence arises a perturbation of
the orb of Saturn in every conjunction of this planet with Jupiter,
so sensible, that astronomers are puzzled with it. As the planet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
is differently situated in these conjunctions, its eccentricity is
sometimes augmented, sometimes diminished; its aphelion is sometimes
carried forward, sometimes backward, and its mean motion is by turns
accelerated and retarded; yet the whole error in its motion about
the sun, though arising from so great a force, may be almost avoided
(except in the mean motion) by placing the lower focus of its orbit
in the common centre of gravity of Jupiter and the sun (according to
Prop. LXVII, Book I), and therefore that error, when it is greatest,
scarcely exceeds two minutes; and the greatest error in the mean motion
scarcely exceeds two minutes yearly. But in the conjunction of Jupiter
and Saturn, the accelerative forces of gravity of the sun towards
Saturn, of Jupiter towards Saturn, and of Jupiter towards the sun, are
almost as 16, 81, and <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{16 \times\, 81 \times\, 3021}{25}" src="images/984.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 16.332ex; height: 4.638ex;" id="img_images_984.svg">,</span> or
156609; and therefore the difference of the forces of gravity of the
sun towards Saturn, and of Jupiter towards Saturn, is to the force of
gravity of Jupiter towards the sun as 65 to 156609, or as 1 to 2409.
But the greatest power of Saturn to disturb the motion of Jupiter is
proportional to this difference; and therefore the perturbation of the
orbit of Jupiter is much less than that of Saturn's. The perturbations
of the other orbits are yet far less, except that the orbit of the
earth is sensibly disturbed by the moon. The common centre of gravity
of the earth and moon moves in an ellipsis about the sun in the
focus thereof, and, by a radius drawn to the sun, describes areas
proportional to the times of description. But the earth in the mean
time by a menstrual motion is revolved about this common centre.</p>

<p class="nindc">
<i>The aphelions and nodes of the orbits of the planets are fixed.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The aphelions are immovable by Prop. XI, Book I; and so are the planes
of the orbits, by Prop. I of the same Book. And if the planes are
fixed, the nodes must be so too. It is true, that some inequalities
may arise from the mutual actions of the planets and comets in their
revolutions; but these will be so small, that they may be here passed
by.</p>

<p>COR. 1. The fixed stars are immovable, seeing they keep the same
position to the aphelions and nodes of the planets.</p>

<p>COR. 2. And since these stars are liable to no sensible parallax
from the annual motion of the earth, they can have no force, because
of their immense distance, to produce any sensible effect in our
system. Not to mention that the fixed stars, every where promiscuously
dispersed in the heavens, by their contrary attractions destroy their
mutual actions, by Prop. LXX, Book I.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>Since the planets near the sun (viz. Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
Mars) are so small that they can act with but little force upon each
other, therefore their aphelions and nodes must be fixed, excepting in
so far as they are disturbed by the actions of Jupiter and Saturn, and
other higher bodies. And hence we may find, by the theory of gravity,
that their aphelions move a little <i>in consequentia</i>, in respect
of the fixed stars, and that in the sesquiplicate proportion of their
several distances from the sun. So that if the aphelion of Mars, in the
space of a hundred years, is carried 33' 20'' <i>in consequentia</i>,
in respect of the fixed stars, the aphelions of the Earth, of Venus,
and of Mercury, will in a hundred years be carried forwards 17'
40''; 10' 53'', and 4' 16'', respectively. But these motions are so
inconsiderable, that we have neglected them in this Proposition.</p>

<p>The Proposition is proved from the first Law of Motion, and Cor. 22,
Prop. LXVI, Book I. Jupiter, with respect to the fixed stars, revolves
in 9<sup>h</sup>. 56'; Mars in 24<sup>h</sup>. 39'; Venus in about 23<sup>h</sup>.; the Earth in
23<sup>h</sup>. 56'; the Sun in <img alt="" data-tex="25\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/985.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_985.svg"> days, and the moon in 27
days, 7 hours, 43'. These things appear by the Phænomena. The spots in
the sun's body return to the same situation on the sun's disk, with

respect to the fixed stars the sun revolves in about <img alt="" data-tex="25\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/985.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_985.svg_1">
days. But because the lunar day, arising from its uniform revolution
about its axis, is menstrual, <i>that is, equal to the time of its
periodic revolution in its orb</i>, therefore the same face of the
moon will be always nearly turned to the upper focus of its orb;
but, as the situation of that focus requires, will deviate a little
to one side and to the other from the earth in the lower focus; and
this is the libration in longitude; for the libration in latitude
arises from the moon's latitude, and the inclination of its axis to
the plane of the ecliptic. This theory of the libration of the moon,
Mr. <i>N. Mercator</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span> in his Astronomy, published at the beginning
of the year 1676, explained more fully out of the letters I sent him.
The utmost satellite of Saturn seems to revolve about its axis with a
motion like this of the moon, respecting Saturn continually with the
same face; for in its revolution round Saturn, as often as it comes to
the eastern part of its orbit, it is scarcely visible, and generally
quite disappears; which is like to be occasioned by some spots in
that part of its body, which is then turned towards the earth, as M.
<i>Cassini</i> has observed. So also the utmost satellite of Jupiter
seems to revolve about its axis with a like motion, because in that
part of its body which is turned from Jupiter it has a spot, which
always appears as if it were in Jupiter's own body, whenever the
satellite passes between Jupiter and our eye.</p>

<p><i>That the axes of the planets are less than the diameters drawn

<p>The equal gravitation of the parts on all sides would give a spherical
figure to the planets, if it was not for their diurnal revolution in
a circle. By that circular motion it comes to pass that the parts
receding from the axis endeavour to ascend about the equator; and
therefore if the matter is in a fluid state, by its ascent towards the
equator it will enlarge the diameters there, and by its descent towards
the poles it will shorten the axis. So the diameter of Jupiter (by
the concurring observations of astronomers) is found shorter betwixt
pole and pole than from east to west. And, by the same argument, if
our earth was not higher about the equator than at the poles, the seas
would subside about the poles, and, rising towards the equator, would
lay all things there under water.</p>

<p>Our countryman, Mr. <i>Norwood</i>, measuring a distance of 905751
feet of <i>London</i> measure between <i>London</i> and <i>York</i>,
in 1635, and observing the difference of latitudes to be 2° 28',
determined the measure of one degree to be 367196 feet of <i>London</i>

measuring an arc of one degree, and 22' 55'' of the meridian between

57060 <i>Paris</i> toises. M. <i>Cassini</i>, the father, measured
the distance upon the meridian from the town of <i>Collioure</i> in

the distance from the Observatory to the Citadel of <i>Dunkirk</i>. The
whole distance was <img alt="" data-tex="486156\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/987.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 8.583ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_987.svg"> toises and the difference of

spherical figure.</p>

<p>In the latitude of <i>Paris</i> a heavy body falling in a second of

that heavy body falling <i>in vacuo</i> will describe a height of 2174

<p>A body in every sidereal day of 23<sup>h</sup>. 56' 4'' uniformly revolving in a
circle at the distance of 19615800 feet from the centre, in one second
of time describes an arc of 1433,46 feet; the versed sine of which is
0,05236561 feet, or 7,54064 lines. And therefore the force with which
bodies descend in the latitude of <i>Paris</i> is to the centrifugal
force of bodies in the equator arising from the diurnal motion of the
earth as 2174 to 7,54064.</p>

<p>The centrifugal force of bodies in the equator is to the centrifugal
force with which bodies recede directly from the earth in the latitude
of <i>Paris</i> 48° 50' 10'' in the duplicate proportion of the radius
to the cosine of the latitude, that is, as 7,54064 to 3,267. Add this
force to the force with which bodies descend by their weight in the
latitude of <i>Paris</i>, and a body, in the latitude of <i>Paris</i>,
falling by its whole undiminished force of gravity, in the time of one
second, will describe 2177·267 lines, or 15 <i>Paris</i> feet, 1 inch,
and 5,267 lines. And the total force of gravity in that latitude will
be to the centrifugal force of bodies in the equator of the earth as

<p>Wherefore if APBQ represent the figure of the earth, now no longer
spherical, but generated by the rotation of an ellipsis about its
lesser axis PQ; and ACQ<i>qca</i> a canal full of water, reaching from
the pole Q<i>q</i> to the centre C<i>c</i>, and thence rising to the
equator A<i>a</i>; the weight of the water in the leg of the canal
AC<i>ca</i> will be to the weight of water in the other leg QC<i>cq</i>
as 289 to 288, because the centrifugal force arising from the circular
motion sustains and takes off one of the 289 parts of the weight (in
the one leg), and the weight of 288 in the other sustains the rest. But
by computation (from Cor. 2, Prop. XCI, Book I) I find, that, if the
matter of the earth was all uniform, and without any motion, and its
axis PQ were to the diameter AB as 100 to 101, the force of gravity
in the place Q towards the earth would be to the force of gravity in
the same place Q towards a sphere described about the centre C with
the radius PC, or QC, as 126 to 125. And, by the same argument, the
force of gravity in the place A towards the spheroid generated by the
rotation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span> the ellipsis APBQ about the axis AB is to the force of
gravity in the same place A, towards the sphere described about the
centre C with the radius AC, as 125 to 126. But the force of gravity in
the place A towards the earth is a mean proportional betwixt the forces
of gravity towards the spheroid and this sphere; because the sphere, by
having its diameter PQ diminished in the proportion of 101 to 100, is
transformed into the figure of the earth; and this figure, by having a
third diameter perpendicular to the two diameters AB and PQ diminished
in the same proportion, is converted into the said spheroid; and the
force of gravity in A, in either case, is diminished nearly in the same
proportion. Therefore the force of gravity in A towards the sphere
described about the centre C with the radius AC, is to the force of
gravity in A towards the earth as 126 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="125\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/991.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_991.svg">.</span> And the
force of gravity in the place Q towards the sphere described about the
centre C with the radius QC, is to the force of gravity in the place A
towards the sphere described about the centre C, with the radius AC, in
the proportion of the diameters (by Prop. LXXII, Book I), that is, as
100 to 101. If, therefore, we compound those three proportions 126 to
125, 126 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="125\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/991.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.189ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_991.svg_1">.</span> and 100 to 101, into one, the force
of gravity in the place Q towards the earth will be to the force of
gravity in the place A towards the earth as <img alt="" data-tex="126 \times\, 126 \times\, 100" src="images/992.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.05ex; width: 16.468ex; height: 1.557ex;" id="img_images_992.svg">

500.</p>

<p>Now since (by Cor. 3, Prop. XCI, Book I) the force of gravity in either
leg of the canal AC<i>ca</i>, or QC<i>cq</i>, is as the distance of
the places from the centre of the earth, if those legs are conceived
to be divided by transverse, parallel, and equidistant surfaces, into
parts proportional to the wholes, the weights of any number of parts in
the one leg AC<i>ca</i> will be to the weights of the same number of
parts in the other leg as their magnitudes and the accelerative forces
of their gravity conjunctly, that is, as 101 to 100, and 500 to 501,
or as 505 to 501. And therefore if the centrifugal force of every part
in the leg AC<i>ca</i>, arising from the diurnal motion, was to the
weight of the same part as 4 to 505, so that from the weight of every
part, conceived to be divided into 505 parts, the centrifugal force
might take off four of those parts, the weights would remain equal
in each leg, and therefore the fluid would rest in an equilibrium.
But the centrifugal force of every part is to the weight of the same
part as 1 to 289; that is, the centrifugal force, which should be
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{4}{505}" src="images/994.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.79ex;" id="img_images_994.svg"> parts of the weight, is only <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{289}" src="images/995.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_995.svg">
part thereof. And, therefore, I say, by the rule of proportion, that
if the centrifugal force make the height of the water in the leg
AC<i>ca</i> to exceed the height of the water in the leg QC<i>cq</i>
by one <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{100}" src="images/996.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_996.svg"> part of its whole height, the centrifugal
force <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{289}" src="images/995.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_995.svg_1"> will make the excess of the height in the

water in the other leg QC<i>cq</i>; and therefore the diameter of the
earth at the equator, is to its diameter from pole to pole as 230 to
229. And since the mean semi-diameter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span> of the earth, according to
<i>Picart's</i> mensuration, is 19615800 <i>Paris</i> feet, or 3923,16
miles (reckoning 5000 feet to a mile), the earth will be higher at the
equator than at the poles by 85472 feet, or <img alt="" data-tex="17\tfrac{1}{10}" src="images/997.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_997.svg"> miles.
And its height at the equator will be about 19658600 feet, and at the
poles 19573000 feet.</p>

<p>If, the density and periodic time of the diurnal revolution remaining
the same, the planet was greater or less than the earth, the proportion
of the centrifugal force to that of gravity, and therefore also of
the diameter betwixt the poles to the diameter at the equator, would
likewise remain the same. But if the diurnal motion was accelerated or
retarded in any proportion, the centrifugal force would be augmented
or diminished nearly in the same duplicate proportion; and therefore
the difference of the diameters will be increased or diminished in the
same duplicate ratio very nearly. And if the density of the planet
was augmented or diminished in any proportion, the force of gravity
tending towards it would also be augmented or diminished in the same
proportion: and the difference of the diameters contrariwise would
be diminished in proportion as the force of gravity is augmented,
and augmented in proportion as the force of gravity is diminished.
Wherefore, since the earth, in respect of the fixed stars, revolves in
23<sup>h</sup>. 56', but Jupiter in 9<sup>h</sup>. 56', and the squares of their periodic
times are as 29 to 5, and their densities as 400 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="94\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/982.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_982.svg_1">,</span>
the difference of the diameters of Jupiter will be to its lesser

40'' and 36'' 25'''; which are to each other as <img alt="" data-tex="11\tfrac{1}{6}" src="images/1001.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1001.svg">

supposition that the body of Jupiter is uniformly dense. But now if its
body be denser towards the plane of the equator than towards the poles,
its diameters may be to each other as 12 to 11, or 13 to 12, or perhaps
as 14 to 13.</p>

<p>And <i>Cassini</i> observed in the year 1691, that the diameter of
Jupiter reaching from east to west is greater by about a fifteenth part
than the other diameter. Mr. <i>Pound</i> with his 123 feet telescope,
and an excellent micrometer, measured the diameters of Jupiter in the
year 1719, and found them as follow.</p>

<p>So that the theory agrees with the phænomena; for the planets are more
heated by the sun's rays towards their equators, and therefore are a
little more condensed by that heat than towards their poles.</p>

<p>Moreover, that there is a diminution of gravity occasioned by the
diurnal rotation of the earth, and therefore the earth rises higher
there than it does at the poles (supposing that its matter is uniformly
dense), will appear by the experiments of pendulums related under the
following Proposition.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XX. PROBLEM IV.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>To find and compare together the weights of bodies in the different

<img alt="How to find and compare together the weights of bodies in the different regions of our earth." height="216" src="images/i_409.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_409.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Because the weights of the unequal legs of the canal of water
ACQ<i>qca</i> are equal; and the weights of the parts proportional
to the whole legs, and alike situated in them, are one to another as
the weights of the wholes, and therefore equal betwixt themselves;
the weights of equal parts, and alike situated in the legs, will be
reciprocally as the legs, that is, reciprocally as 230 to 229. And the
case is the same in all homogeneous equal bodies alike situated in the
legs of the canal. Their weights are reciprocally as the legs, that
is, reciprocally as the distances of the bodies from the centre of the
earth. Therefore if the bodies are situated in the uppermost parts of
the canals, or on the surface of the earth, their weights will be one
to another reciprocally as their distances from the centre. And, by the
same argument, the weights in all other places round the whole surface
of the earth are reciprocally as the distances of the places from
the centre; and, therefore, in the hypothesis of the earth's being a
spheroid are given in proportion.</p>

<p>Whence arises this Theorem, that the increase of weight in passing
from the equator to the poles is nearly as the versed sine of double
the latitude; or, which comes to the same thing, as the square of the
right sine of the latitude; and the arcs of the degrees of latitude in
the meridian increase nearly in the same proportion. And, therefore,
since the latitude of <i>Paris</i> is 48° 50', that of places under the
equator 00° 00', and that of places under the poles 90°; and the versed
sines of double those arcs are 11334,00000 and 20000, the radius being
10000; and the force of gravity at the pole is to the force of gravity
at the equator as 230 to 229; and the excess of the force of gravity at
the pole to the force of gravity at the equator as 1 to 229; the excess
of the force of gravity in the latitude of <i>Paris</i> will be to the
force of gravity at the equator as <img alt="" data-tex="1 \times\, \tfrac{11334}{20000}" src="images/1009.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 9.27ex; height: 2.79ex;" id="img_images_1009.svg">
to 229, or as 5667 to 2290000. And therefore the whole forces of
gravity in those places will be one to the other as 2295667 to 2290000.
Wherefore since the lengths of pendulums vibrating in equal times are
as the forces of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span> gravity, and in the latitude of <i>Paris</i>, the
length of a pendulum vibrating seconds is 3 <i>Paris</i> feet, and
<img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1010.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1010.svg"> lines, or rather because of the weight of the air,

<p>By this table, therefore, it appears that the inequality of degrees is
so small, that the figure of the earth, in geographical matters, may
be considered as spherical; especially if the earth be a little denser
towards the plane of the equator than towards the poles.</p>

<p>Now several astronomers, sent into remote countries to make
astronomical observations, have found that pendulum clocks do
accordingly move slower near the equator than in our climates. And,
first of all, in the year 1672, M. <i>Richer</i> took notice of it in
the island of <i>Cayenne</i>; for when, in the month of <i>August</i>,
he was observing the transits of the fixed stars over the meridian,
he found his clock to go slower than it ought in respect of the mean
motion of the sun at the rate of 2' 28'' a day. Therefore, fitting
up a simple pendulum to vibrate in seconds, which were measured by
an excellent clock, he observed the length of that simple pendulum;
and this he did over and over every week for ten months together.
And upon his return to <i>France</i>, comparing the length of that
pendulum with the length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span> of the pendulum at <i>Paris</i> (which was 3
<i>Paris</i> feet and <img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{3}{5}" src="images/1012.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_1012.svg"> lines), he found it shorter by
<img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/1013.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1013.svg"> line.</p>

<p>Afterwards, our friend Dr. <i>Halley</i>, about the year 1677, arriving
at the island of St. <i>Helena</i>, found his pendulum clock to go
slower there than at <i>London</i> without marking the difference. But
he shortened the rod of his clock by more than the <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{8}" src="images/637.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_637.svg_8"> of
an inch, or <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/208.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_208.svg_3"> line; and to effect this, because the
length of the screw at the lower end of the rod was not sufficient, he
interposed a wooden ring betwixt the nut and the ball.</p>

<p>Then, in the year 1682, M. <i>Varin</i> and M. <i>des Hayes</i> found
the length of a simple pendulum vibrating in seconds at the Royal
Observatory of <i>Paris</i> to be 3 feet and <img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{5}{9}" src="images/1011.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1011.svg_1"> lines.
And by the same method in the island of <i>Goree</i>, they found the
length of an isochronal pendulum to be 3 feet and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{5}{9}" src="images/878.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_878.svg_1">
lines, differing from the former by two lines. And in the same year,
going to the islands of <i>Guadeloupe</i> and <i>Martinico</i>, they
found that the length of an isochronal pendulum in those islands was 3
feet and <img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/727.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_727.svg_3"> lines.</p>

<p>After this, M. <i>Couplet</i>, the son, in the month of <i>July
1697</i>, at the Royal Observatory of <i>Paris</i>, so fitted his
pendulum clock to the mean motion of the sun, that for a considerable
time together the clock agreed with the motion of the sun. In
<i>November</i> following, upon his arrival at <i>Lisbon</i>, he
found his clock to go slower than before at the rate of 2' 13'' in
24 hours. And next <i>March</i> coming to <i>Paraiba</i>, he found
his clock to go slower than at <i>Paris</i>, and at the rate 4' 12''
in 24 hours; and he affirms, that the pendulum vibrating in seconds
was shorter at <i>Lisbon</i> by <img alt="" data-tex="2\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/959.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_959.svg_1"> lines, and at
<i>Paraiba</i> by <img alt="" data-tex="3\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1014.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1014.svg"> lines, than at <i>Paris</i>. He had
done better to have reckoned those differences <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/1015.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1015.svg"> and
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="2\tfrac{5}{9}" src="images/1016.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1016.svg">:</span> for these differences correspond to the differences
of the times 2' 13'' and 4' 12''. But this gentleman's observations are
so gross, that we cannot confide in them.</p>

<p>In the following years, 1699, and 1700, M. <i>des Hayes</i>, making
another voyage to <i>America</i>, determined that in the island of
<i>Cayenne</i> and <i>Granada</i> the length of the pendulum vibrating
in seconds was a small matter less than 3 feet and <img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/727.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_727.svg_4">
lines; that in the island of St. <i>Christophers</i> it was 3 feet and
<img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/1017.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_1017.svg"> lines; and in the island of St. <i>Domingo</i> 3 feet
and 7 lines.</p>

<p>And in the year 1704, P. <i>Feuillé</i>, at <i>Puerto Bello</i> in
<i>America</i>, found that the length of the pendulum vibrating
in seconds was 3 <i>Paris feet</i>, and only <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{7}{12}" src="images/1018.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.753ex;" id="img_images_1018.svg">
lines, that is, almost 3 lines shorter than at <i>Paris</i>; but
the observation was faulty. For afterward, going to the island of
<i>Martinico</i>, he found the length of the isochronal pendulum there
3 <i>Paris</i> feet and <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{10}{12}" src="images/1019.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1019.svg"> lines.</p>

<p>Now the latitude of <i>Paraiba</i> is 6° 38' south; that of
<i>Puerto Bello</i> 9° 33' north; and the latitudes of the islands
<i>Cayenne</i>, <i>Goree</i>, <i>Guadeloupe</i>, <i>Martinico</i>,
<i>Granada</i>, St. <i>Christophers</i>, and St. <i>Domingo</i>, are
respectively 4° 55', 14° 40', 15° 00', 14° 44', 12° 06', 17° 19', and
19° 48', north. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span> the excesses of the length of the pendulum at
<i>Paris</i> above the lengths of the isochronal pendulums observed in
those latitudes are a little greater than by the table of the lengths
of the pendulum before computed. And therefore the earth is a little
higher under the equator than by the preceding calculus, and a little
denser at the centre than in mines near the surface, unless, perhaps,
the heats of the torrid zone have a little extended the length of the
pendulums.</p>

<p>For M. <i>Picart</i> has observed, that a rod of iron, which in frosty
weather in the winter season was one foot long, when heated by fire,
was lengthened into one foot and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/228.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_228.svg_9"> line. Afterward M.
<i>de la Hire</i> found that a rod of iron, which in the like winter
season was 6 feet long, when exposed to the heat of the summer sun, was
extended into 6 feet and <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/226.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_226.svg_2"> line. In the former case the
heat was greater than in the latter; but in the latter it was greater
than the heat of the external parts of a human body; for metals exposed
to the summer sun acquire a very considerable degree of heat. But the
rod of a pendulum clock is never exposed to the heat of the summer
sun, nor ever acquires a heat equal to that of the external parts of a
human body; and, therefore, though the 3 feet rod of a pendulum clock
will indeed be a little longer in the summer than in the winter season,
yet the difference will scarcely amount to <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/228.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_228.svg_10"> line.
Therefore the total difference of the lengths of isochronal pendulums
in different climates cannot be ascribed to the difference of heat; nor
indeed to the mistakes of the <i>French</i> astronomers. For although
there is not a perfect agreement betwixt their observations, yet the
errors are so small that they may be neglected; and in this they all
agree, that isochronal pendulums are shorter under the equator than at
the Royal Observatory of <i>Paris</i>, by a difference not less than
<img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/1013.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1013.svg_1"> line, nor greater than <img alt="" data-tex="2\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1020.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1020.svg"> lines. By

to the other observers. If this gentleman's observations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span> are to be

</div>

<p>That the greater planets, while they are carried about the sun, may
in the mean time carry other lesser planets, revolving about them;
and that those lesser planets must move in ellipses which have their
foci in the centres of the greater, appears from Prop. LXV, Book I.
But then their motions will be several ways disturbed by the action
of the sun, and they will suffer such inequalities as are observed in
our moon. Thus our moon (by Cor. 2, 3, 4, and 5, Prop. LXVI, Book I)
moves faster, and, by a radius drawn to the earth, describes an area
greater for the time, and has its orbit less curved, and therefore
approaches nearer to the earth in the syzygies than in the quadratures,
excepting in so far as these effects are hindered by the motion of
eccentricity; for (by Cor. 9, Prop. LXVI, Book I) the eccentricity is
greatest when the apogeon of the moon is in the syzygies, and least
when the same is in the quadratures; and upon this account the perigeon
moon is swifter, and nearer to us, but the apogeon moon slower, and
farther from us, in the syzygies than in the quadratures. Moreover,
the apogee goes forward, and the nodes backward; and this is done not
with a regular but an unequal motion. For (by Cor. 7 and 8, Prop. LXVI,
Book I) the apogee goes more swiftly forward in its syzygies, more
slowly backward in its quadratures; and, by the excess of its progress
above its regress, advances yearly <i>in consequentia</i>. But,
contrariwise, the nodes (by Cor. 11, Prop. LXVI, Book I) are quiescent
in their syzygies, and go fastest back in their quadratures. Farther,
the greatest latitude of the moon (by Cor. 10, Prop. LXVI, Book I) is
greater in the quadratures of the moon than in its syzygies. And (by
Cor. 6, Prop. LXVI, Book I) the mean motion of the moon is slower in
the perihelion of the earth than in its aphelion. And these are the
principal inequalities (of the moon) taken notice of by astronomers.</p>

<p>But there are yet other inequalities not observed by former
astronomers, by which the motions of the moon are so disturbed, that
to this day we have not been able to bring them under any certain
rule. For the velocities or horary motions of the apogee and nodes of
the moon, and their equations, as well as the difference betwixt the
greatest eccentricity in the syzygies, and the least eccentricity in
the quadratures, and that inequality which we call the variation, are
(by Cor. 14, Prop. LXVI, Book I) in the course of the year augmented
and diminished in the triplicate proportion of the sun's apparent
diameter. And besides (by Cor. 1 and 2, Lem. 10, and Cor. 16, Prop.
LXVI, Book I) the variation is augmented and diminished nearly in
the duplicate proportion of the time between the quadratures. But in
astronomical calculations, this inequality is commonly thrown into and
confounded with the equation of the moon's centre.</p>

<p><i>To derive the unequal motions of the satellites of Jupiter and
Saturn from the motions of our moon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>From the motions of our moon we deduce the corresponding motions of
the moons or satellites of Jupiter in this manner, by Cor. 16, Prop.
LXVI, Book I. The mean motion of the nodes of the outmost satellite of
Jupiter is to the mean motion of the nodes of our moon in a proportion
compounded of the duplicate proportion of the periodic times of the
earth about the sun to the periodic times of Jupiter about the sun,
and the simple proportion of the periodic time of the satellite
about Jupiter to the periodic time of our moon about the earth; and,
therefore, those nodes, in the space of a hundred years, are carried
8° 24' backward, or <i>in antecedentia</i>. The mean motions of the
nodes of the inner satellites are to the mean motion of the nodes of
the outmost as their periodic times to the periodic time of the former,
by the same Corollary, and are thence given. And the motion of the
apsis of every satellite <i>in consequentia</i> is to the motion of
its nodes <i>in antecedentia</i> as the motion of the apogee of our
moon to the motion of its nodes (by the same Corollary), and is thence
given. But the motions of the apsides thus found must be diminished in
the proportion of 5 to 9, or of about 1 to 2, on account of a cause
which I cannot here descend to explain. The greatest equations of
the nodes, and of the apsis of every satellite, are to the greatest
equations of the nodes, and apogee of our moon respectively, as the
motions of the nodes and apsides of the satellites, in the time of
one revolution of the former equations, to the motions of the nodes
and apogee of our moon, in the time of one revolution of the latter
equations. The variation of a satellite seen from Jupiter is to the
variation of our moon in the same proportion as the whole motions of
their nodes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span> respectively during the times in which the satellite and
our moon (after parting from) are revolved (again) to the sun, by the
same Corollary; and therefore in the outmost satellite the variation
does not exceed 5'' 12'''.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XXIV. THEOREM XIX.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>That the flux and reflux of the sea arise from the actions of the
sun and moon.</i></p>
</div>

<p>By Cor. 19 and 20, Prop. LXVI, Book I, it appears that the waters
of the sea ought twice to rise and twice to fall every day, as well
lunar as solar; and that the greatest height of the waters in the
open and deep seas ought to follow the appulse of the luminaries to
the meridian of the place by a less interval than 6 hours; as happens
in all that eastern tract of the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Æthiopic</i>
seas between <i>France</i> and the <i>Cape of Good Hope</i>; and on
the coasts of <i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i> in the <i>South Sea</i>;
in all which shores the flood falls out about the second, third, or
fourth hour, unless where the motion propagated from the deep ocean is
by the shallowness of the channels, through which it passes to some
particular places, retarded to the fifth, sixth, or seventh hour, and
even later. The hours I reckon from the appulse of each luminary to the
meridian of the place, as well under as above the horizon; and by the
hours of the lunar day I understand the 24th parts of that time which
the moon, by its apparent diurnal motion, employs to come about again
to the meridian of the place which it left the day before. The force of
the sun or moon in raising the sea is greatest in the appulse of the
luminary to the meridian of the place; but the force impressed upon the
sea at that time continues a little while after the impression, and is
afterwards increased by a new though less force still acting upon it.
This makes the sea rise higher and higher, till this new force becoming
too weak to raise it any more, the sea rises to its greatest height.
And this will come to pass, perhaps, in one or two hours, but more
frequently near the shores in about three hours, or even more, where
the sea is shallow.</p>

<p>The two luminaries excite two motions, which will not appear
distinctly, but between them will arise one mixed motion compounded
out of both. In the conjunction or opposition of the luminaries their
forces will be conjoined, and bring on the greatest flood and ebb. In
the quadratures the sun will raise the waters which the moon depresses,
and depress the waters which the moon raises, and from the difference
of their forces the smallest of all tides will follow. And because (as
experience tells us) the force of the moon is greater than that of the
sun, the greatest height of the waters will happen about the third
lunar hour. Out of the syzygies and quadratures, the greatest tide,
which by the single force of the moon ought to fall out at the third
lunar hour, and by the single force of the sun at the third solar hour,
by the compounded forces of both must fall out in an intermediate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span> time
that approaches nearer to the third hour of the moon than to that of
the sun. And, therefore, while the moon is passing from the syzygies
to the quadratures, during which time the 3d hour of the sun precedes
the 3d hour of the moon, the greatest height of the waters will also
precede the 3d hour of the moon, and that, by the greatest interval,
a little after the octants of the moon; and, by like intervals, the
greatest tide will follow the 3d lunar hour, while the moon is passing
from the quadratures to the syzygies. Thus it happens in the open sea;
for in the mouths of rivers the greater tides come later to their
height.</p>

<p>But the effects of the luminaries depend upon their distances from the
earth; for when they are less distant, their effects are greater, and
when more distant, their effects are less, and that in the triplicate
proportion of their apparent diameter. Therefore it is that the sun,
in the winter time, being then in its perigee, has a greater effect,
and makes the tides in the syzygies something greater, and those in
the quadratures something less than in the summer season; and every
month the moon, while in the perigee, raises greater tides than at the
distance of 15 days before or after, when it is in its apogee. Whence
it comes to pass that two highest tides do not follow one the other in
two immediately succeeding syzygies.</p>

<p>The effect of either luminary doth likewise depend upon its declination
or distance from the equator; for if the luminary was placed at
the pole, it would constantly attract all the parts of the waters
without any intension or remission of its action, and could cause no
reciprocation of motion. And, therefore, as the luminaries decline from
the equator towards either pole, they will, by degrees, lose their
force, and on this account will excite lesser tides in the solstitial
than in the equinoctial syzygies. But in the solstitial quadratures
they will raise greater tides than in the quadratures about the
equinoxes; because the force of the moon, then situated in the equator,
most exceeds the force of the sun. Therefore the greatest tides fall
out in those syzygies, and the least in those quadratures, which happen
about the time of both equinoxes: and the greatest tide in the syzygies
is always succeeded by the least tide in the quadratures, as we find
by experience. But, because the sun is less distant from the earth in
winter than in summer, it comes to pass that the greatest and least
tides more frequently appear before than after the vernal equinox, and
more frequently after than before the autumnal.</p>

<figure class="figleft width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_416">
<img alt="A luminary’s effect depends on its declination; at the pole, it would attract water parts constantly without causing motion reciprocation." height="128" src="images/i_416.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_416.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Moreover, the effects of the luminaries depend upon the latitudes of
places. Let A<i>p</i>EP represent the earth covered with deep waters;
C its centre; P, <i>p</i> its poles; AE the equator; F any place
without the equator; F<i>f</i> the parallel of the place; D<i>d</i>
the correspondent parallel on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span> other side of the equator; L the
place of the moon three hours before; H the place of the earth directly
under it; <i>h</i> the opposite place; K, <i>k</i> the places at 90
degrees distance; CH, C<i>h</i>, the greatest heights of the sea from
the centre of the earth; and CK, C<i>k</i>, its least heights: and
if with the axes H<i>h</i>, K<i>k</i>, an ellipsis is described, and
by the revolution of that ellipsis about its longer axis H<i>h</i> a
spheroid HPK<i>hpk</i> is formed, this spheroid will nearly represent
the figure of the sea; and CF, C<i>f</i>, CD, C<i>d</i>, will represent
the heights of the sea in the places F<i>f</i>, D<i>d</i>. But farther;
in the said revolution of the ellipsis any point N describes the circle
NM cutting the parallels F<i>f</i>, D<i>d</i>, in any places RT, and
the equator AE in S; CN will represent the height of the sea in all
those places R, S, T, situated in this circle. Wherefore, in the
diurnal revolution of any place F, the greatest flood will be in F,
at the third hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian above
the horizon; and afterwards the greatest ebb in Q, at the third hour
after the setting of the moon; and then the greatest flood in <i>f</i>,
at the third hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian under
the horizon; and, lastly, the greatest ebb in Q, at the third hour
after the rising of the moon; and the latter flood in <i>f</i> will
be less than the preceding flood in F. For the whole sea is divided
into two hemispherical floods, one in the hemisphere KH<i>k</i> on the
north side, the other in the opposite hemisphere K<i>hk</i>, which
we may therefore call the northern and the southern floods. These
floods, being always opposite the one to the other, come by turns to
the meridians of all places, after an interval of 12 lunar hours. And
seeing the northern countries partake more of the northern flood, and
the southern countries more of the southern flood, thence arise tides,
alternately greater and less in all places without the equator, in
which the luminaries rise and set. But the greatest tide will happen
when the moon declines towards the vertex of the place, about the third
hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian above the horizon;
and when the moon changes its declination <i>to the other side of the
equator</i>, that which was the greater tide will be changed into a
lesser. And the greatest difference of the floods will fall out about
the times of the solstices; especially if the ascending node of the
moon is about the first of Aries. So it is found by experience that the
morning tides in winter exceed those of the evening, and the evening
tides in summer exceed those of the morning; at <i>Plymouth</i> by the
height of one foot, but at <i>Bristol</i> by the height of 15 inches,
according to the observations of <i>Colepress</i> and <i>Sturmy</i>.</p>

<p>But the motions which we have been describing suffer some alteration
from that force of reciprocation, which the waters, being once moved,
retain a little while <i>by their vis insita</i>. Whence it comes to
pass that the tides may continue for some time, though the actions of
the luminaries should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span> cease. This power of retaining the impressed
motion lessens the difference of the alternate tides, and makes those
tides which immediately succeed after the syzygies greater, and those
which follow next after the quadratures less. And hence it is that
the alternate tides at <i>Plymouth</i> and <i>Bristol</i> do not
differ much more one from the other than by the height of a foot or 15
inches, and that the greatest tides of all at those ports are not the
first but the third after the syzygies. And, besides, all the motions
are retarded in their passage through shallow channels, so that the
greatest tides of all, in some straits and mouths of rivers, are the
fourth or even the fifth after the syzygies.</p>

<p>Farther, it may happen that the tide may be propagated from the ocean
through different channels towards the same port, and may pass quicker
through some channels than through others; in which case the same
tide, divided into two or more succeeding one another, may compound
new motions of different kinds. Let us suppose two equal tides flowing
towards the same port from different places, the one preceding the
other by 6 hours; and suppose the first tide to happen at the third
hour of the appulse of the moon to the meridian of the port. If the
moon at the time of the appulse to the meridian was in the equator,
every 6 hours alternately there would arise equal floods, which,
meeting with as many equal ebbs, would so balance one the other,
that for that day, the water would stagnate and remain quiet. If the
moon then declined from the equator, the tides in the ocean would be
alternately greater and less, as was said; and from thence two greater
and two lesser tides would be alternately propagated towards that port.
But the two greater floods would make the greatest height of the waters
to fall out in the middle time betwixt both; and the greater and lesser
floods would make the waters to rise to a mean height in the middle
time between them, and in the middle time between the two lesser floods
the waters would rise to their least height. Thus in the space of 24
hours the waters would come, not twice, as commonly, but once only to
their greatest, and once only to their least height; and their greatest
height, if the moon declined towards the elevated pole, would happen
at the 6th or 30th hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian;
and when the moon changed its declination, this flood would be changed
into an ebb. An example of all which Dr. <i>Halley</i> has given us,
from the observations of seamen in the port of <i>Batsham</i>, in the
kingdom of <i>Tunquin</i>, in the latitude of 20° 50' north. In that
port, on the day which follows after the passage of the moon over the
equator, the waters stagnate: when the moon declines to the north, they
begin to flow and ebb, not twice, as in other ports, but once only
every day: and the flood happens at the setting, and the greatest ebb
at the rising of the moon. This tide increases with the declination of
the moon till the 7th or 8th day; then for the 7 or 8 days following
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span> decreases at the same rate as it had increased before, and ceases
when the moon changes its declination, crossing over the equator to
the south. After which the flood is immediately changed into an ebb;
and thenceforth the ebb happens at the setting and the flood at the
rising of the moon; till the moon, again passing the equator, changes
its declination. There are two inlets to this port and the neighboring
channels, one from the seas of <i>China</i>, between the continent and
the island of <i>Leuconia</i>; the other from the <i>Indian</i> sea,
between the continent and the island of <i>Borneo</i>. But whether
there be really two tides propagated through the said channels, one
from the <i>Indian</i> sea in the space of 12 hours, and one from the
sea of <i>China</i> in the space of 6 hours, which therefore happening
at the 3d and 9th lunar hours, by being compounded together, produce
those motions; or whether there be any other circumstances in the
state of those seas, I leave to be determined by observations on the
neighbouring shores.</p>

<p>Thus I have explained the causes of the motions of the moon and of the
sea. Now it is fit to subjoin something concerning the quantity of
those motions.</p>

revolved about their common centre of gravity, the motion of the earth
about that centre will be also disturbed by the like forces; but we

<p>We have above shown that the area which the moon describes by a

excepting in so far as the moon's motion is disturbed by the action
of the sun; and here we propose to investigate the inequality of the
moment, or horary increment <i>of that area or motion so disturbed</i>.
To render the calculus more easy, we shall suppose the orbit of the
moon to be circular, and neglect all inequalities but that only which
is now under consideration; and, because of the immense distance
of the sun, we shall farther suppose that the lines SP and ST are
parallel. By this means, the force LM will be always reduced to its
mean quantity TP, as well as the force TM to its mean quantity 3PK.
These forces (by Cor. 2 of the Laws of Motion) compose the force TL;

TP, is resolved into the forces TE, EL; of which the force TE, acting
constantly in the direction of the radius TP, neither accelerates
nor retards the description of the area TPC made by that radius TP;

To this velocity of the moon, which is proportional to the mean moment

11915), we add and subtract the half of the other velocity; the sum
11915 + 50, or 11965, will represent the greatest moment of the area

times are described in the syzygies and quadratures are one to the
other as 11965 to 11865. And if to the least moment 11865 we add a
moment which shall be to 100, the difference of the two former moments,
as the trapezium FKCG to the triangle TCG, or, which comes to the same
thing, as the square of the sine PK to the square of the radius TP
(that is, as P<i>d</i> to TP), the sum will represent the moment of the
area when the moon is in any intermediate place P.</p>

<p>But these things take place only in the hypothesis that the sun and the

finished in 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43'. But since the moon's synodical period is
really 29<sup>d</sup>. 12<sup>h</sup>. 44', the increments of the moments must be enlarged
in the same proportion as the time is, that is, in the proportion of
1080853 to 1000000. Upon which account, the whole increment, which
was <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{100}{11915}" src="images/1028.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.995ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1028.svg_2"> parts of the mean moment, will now become

area in the quadrature of the moon will be to the moment thereof in the
syzygy as 11023 - 50 to 11023 + 50; or as 10973 to 11073; and to the
moment thereof, when the moon is in any intermediate place P, as 10973

<p>The area, therefore, which the moon, by a radius drawn to the earth,
describes in the several little equal parts of time, is nearly as the
sum of the number 219,46, and the versed sine of the double distance of
the moon from the nearest quadrature, considered in a circle which hath
unity for its radius. Thus it is when the variation in the octants is
in its mean quantity. But if the variation there is greater or less,
that versed sine must be augmented or diminished in the same proportion.</p>

<p>Because the figure of the moon's orbit is unknown, let us, in its
stead, assume the ellipsis DBCA, in the centre of which we suppose
the earth to be situated, and the greater axis DC to lie between the
quadratures as the lesser AB between the syzygies. But since the plane
of this ellipsis is revolved about the earth by an angular motion,
and the orbit, whose curvature we now examine, should be described in
a plane void of such motion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span> we are to consider the figure which the
moon, while it is revolved in that ellipsis, describes in this plane,
that is to say, the figure C<i>pa</i>, the several points <i>p</i> of
which are found by assuming any point P in the ellipsis, which may
represent the place of the moon, and drawing T<i>p</i> equal to TP in
such manner that the angle PT<i>p</i> may be equal to the apparent
motion of the sun from the time of the last quadrature in C; or (which
comes to the same thing) that the angle CT<i>p</i> may be to the angle
CTP as the time of the synodic revolution of the moon to the time of
the periodic revolution thereof, or as 29<sup>d</sup>. 12<sup>h</sup>. 44' to 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>.
43'. If, therefore, in this proportion we take the angle CT<i>a</i>
to the right angle CTA, and make T<i>a</i> of equal length with TA,
we shall have <i>a</i> the lower and C the upper apsis of this orbit
C<i>pa</i>. But, by computation, I find that the difference betwixt
the curvature of this orbit C<i>pa</i> at the vertex <i>a</i>, and the
curvature of a circle described about the centre T with the interval
TA, is to the difference between the curvature of the ellipsis at
the vertex A, and the curvature of the same circle, in the duplicate
proportion of the angle CTP to the angle CT<i>p</i>; and that the
curvature of the ellipsis in A is to the curvature of that circle
in the duplicate proportion of TA to TC; and the curvature of that
circle to the curvature of a circle described about the centre T with
the interval TC as TC to TA; but that the curvature of this <i>last
arch</i> is to the curvature of the ellipsis in C in the duplicate
proportion of TA to TC; and that the difference betwixt the curvature
of the ellipsis in the vertex C, and the curvature of this last circle,
is to the difference betwixt the curvature of the figure C<i>pa</i>,
at the vertex C, and the curvature of this same <i>last</i> circle,
in the duplicate proportion of the angle CT<i>p</i> to the angle CTP;
all which proportions are easily drawn from the sines of the angles
of contact, and of the differences of those angles. But, by comparing
those proportions together, we find the curvature of the figure
C<i>pa</i> at <i>a</i> to be to its curvature at C as

the square of the time 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43'.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, <i>a</i> represents the syzygy of the moon, and
C its quadrature, the proportion now found must be the same with
that proportion of the curvature of the moon's orb in the syzygies
to the curvature thereof in the quadratures, which we found above.
Therefore, in order to find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span> proportion of CT to AT, let us

applied to AT × CT, become 2062,79CT<sup>4</sup> - 2151969N × CT<sup>3</sup> + 368676N ×

put 1, and <i>x</i> for their half difference, then CT will be = 1 +

equation, after resolving thereof, we shall find <i>x</i> = 0,00719;

<p>This inequality is owing partly to the elliptic figure of the moon's
orbit, partly to the inequality of the moments of the area which the
moon by a radius drawn to the earth describes. If the moon P revolved
in the ellipsis DBCA about the earth quiescent in the centre of the
ellipsis, and by the radius TP, drawn to the earth, described the area
CTP, proportional to the time <i>of description</i>; and the greatest
semi-diameter CT of the ellipsis was to the least TA as 70 to 69; the
tangent of the angle CTP would be to the tangent of the angle of the
mean motion, computed from the quadrature C, as the semi-diameter
TA of the ellipsis to its semi-diameter TC, or as 69 to 70. But the
description of the area CTP, as the moon advances from the quadrature
to the syzygy, ought to be in such manner accelerated, that the moment
of the area in the moon's syzygy may be to the moment thereof in its
quadrature as 11073 to 10973; and that the excess of the moment in
any intermediate place P above the moment in the quadrature may be
as the square of the sine of the angle CTP; which we may effect with
accuracy enough, if we diminish the tangent of the angle CTP in the
subduplicate proportion of the number 10973 to the number 11073, that
is, in proportion of the number 68,6877 to the number 69. Upon which
account the tangent of the angle CTP will now be to the tangent of
the mean motion as 68,6877 to 70; and the angle CTP in the octants,
where the mean motion is 45°, will be found 44° 27' 28'', which
subtracted from 45°, the angle of the mean motion, leaves the greatest
variation 32' 32''. Thus it would be, if the moon, in passing from the
quadrature to the syzygy, described an angle CTA of 90 degrees only.
But because of the motion of the earth, by which the sun is apparently
transferred <i>in consequentia</i>, the moon, before it overtakes the
sun, describes an angle CT<i>a</i>, greater than a right angle, in the
proportion of the time of the synodic revolution of the moon to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</span>time of its periodic revolution, that is, in the proportion of 29<sup>d</sup>.
12<sup>h</sup>. 44' to 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43'. Whence it comes to pass that all the
angles about the centre T are dilated in the same proportion; and the
greatest variation, which otherwise would be <i>but</i> 32' 32'', now
augmented in the said proportion, becomes 35' 10''.</p>

<p>And this is its magnitude in the mean distance of the sun from the
earth, neglecting the differences which may arise from the curvature
of the <i>orbis magnus</i>, and the stronger action of the sun upon
the moon when horned and new, than when gibbous and full. In other
distances of the sun from the earth, the greatest variation is in a
proportion compounded of the duplicate proportion of the time of the
synodic revolution of the moon (the time of the year being given)
directly, and the triplicate proportion of the distance of the sun
from the earth inversely. And, therefore, in the apogee of the sun,
the greatest variation is 33' 14'', and in its perigee 37' 11'', if
the eccentricity of the sun is to the transverse semi-diameter of the
<i>orbis magnus</i> as <img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{15}{16}" src="images/1041.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1041.svg"> to 1000.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have investigated the variation in an orb not eccentric,
in which, to wit, the moon in its octants is always in its mean
distance from the earth. If the moon, on account of its eccentricity,
is more or less removed from the earth than if placed in this orb, the
variation may be something greater, or something less, than according
to this rule. But I leave the excess or defect to the determination of
astronomers from the phænomena.</p>

(by Prop. XXV) is twofold, one proportional to the line LM, the other
to the line MT, in the scheme of that Proposition; and the moon by the
former force is drawn towards the earth, by the latter towards the sun,
in a direction parallel to the right line ST joining the earth and the
sun. The former force LM acts in the direction of the plane of the
moon's orbit, and therefore makes no change upon the situation thereof,
and is upon that account to be neglected; the latter force MT, by which
the plane of the moon's orbit is disturbed, is the same with the force
3PK or 3IT. And this force (by Prop. XXV) is to the force by which the
moon may, in its periodic time, be uniformly revolved in a circle about
the earth at rest, as 3IT to the radius of the circle multiplied by the
number 178,725, or as IT to the radius thereof multiplied by 59,575.
But in this calculus, and all that follows, I consider all the lines
drawn from the moon to the sun as parallel to the line which joins the
earth and the sun; because what inclination there is almost as much
diminishes all effects in some cases as it augments them in others; and
we are now inquiring after the mean motions of the nodes, neglecting
such niceties as are of no moment, and would only serve to render the
calculus more perplexed.</p>

same time; and joining PL, MP, let them be produced to <i>m</i> and
<i>l</i>, where they cut the plane of the ecliptic, and upon T<i>m</i>
let fall the perpendicular PH. Now, since the right line ML is
parallel to the plane of the ecliptic, and therefore can never meet
with the right line <i>ml</i> which lies in that plane, and yet both
those right lines lie in one common plane LMP<i>ml</i>, they will be
parallel, and upon that account the triangles LMP, <i>lm</i>P will
be similar. And seeing MP<i>m</i> lies in the plane of the orbit,
in which the moon did move while in the place P, the point <i>m</i>
will fall upon the line N<i>n</i>, which passes through the nodes N,
<i>n</i>, of that orbit. And because the force by which the half of
the little line LM is generated, if the whole had been together, and
it once impressed in the point P, would have generated that whole
line, and caused the moon to move in the arc whose chord is LP; that
is to say, would have transferred the moon from the plane MP<i>m</i>T
into the plane LP<i>l</i>T; therefore the angular motion of the nodes
generated by that force will be equal to the angle <i>m</i>T<i>l</i>.
But <i>ml</i> is to <i>m</i>P as ML to MP; and since MP, because of
the time given, is also given, <i>ml</i> will be as the rectangle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</span>
ML × <i>m</i>P, that is, as the rectangle IT × <i>m</i>P. And if
T<i>ml</i> is a right angle, the angle <i>m</i>T<i>l</i> will be as
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{ml}{\mathrm{T}m}" src="images/1042.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 4.615ex; height: 4.676ex;" id="img_images_1042.svg">,</span> and therefore as 
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{IT} \times\, \mathrm{P}m}{\mathrm{T}m}" src="images/1043.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 10.116ex; height: 4.652ex;" id="img_images_1043.svg">,</span>
that is (because T<i>m</i> and <i>m</i>P, TP and PH are proportional),
as <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{IT} \times\, \mathrm{PH}}{\mathrm{TP}}" src="images/1044.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.552ex; width: 9.827ex; height: 4.627ex;" id="img_images_1044.svg">;</span> and,
therefore, because TP is given, as IT × PH. But if the angle T<i>ml</i>
or STN is oblique, the angle <i>m</i>T<i>l</i> will be yet less, in
proportion of the sine of the angle STN to the radius, or AZ to AT. And
therefore the velocity of the nodes is as IT × PH × AZ, or as the solid
content of the sines of the three angles TPI, PTN, and STN.</p>

<p>If these are right angles, as happens when the nodes are in the
quadratures, and the moon in the syzygy, the little line <i>ml</i> will
be removed to an infinite distance, and the angle <i>m</i>T<i>l</i>
will become equal to the angle <i>m</i>P<i>l</i>. But in this case the
angle <i>m</i>P<i>l</i> is to the angle PTM, which the moon in the same
time by its apparent motion describes about the earth, as 1 to 59,575.
For the angle <i>m</i>P<i>l</i> is equal to the angle LPM, that is,
to the angle of the moon's deflexion from a rectilinear path; which
angle, if the gravity of the moon should have then ceased, the said
force of the sun 3IT would by itself have generated in that given time;
and the angle PTM is equal to the angle of the moon's deflexion from a
rectilinear path; which angle, if the force of the sun 3IT should have
then ceased, the force alone by which the moon is retained in its orbit
would have generated in the same time. And these forces (as we have
above shewn) are the one to the other as 1 to 59,575. Since, therefore,
the mean horary motion of the moon (in respect of the fixed stars)
is 32' 56'' 27''' <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="12\tfrac{1}{2}^{iv}" src="images/1045.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.573ex; height: 3.177ex;" id="img_images_1045.svg">.</span> the horary motion of the
node in this case will be 33'' 10''' 33<sup>iv</sup>. 12<sup>v</sup>. But in other cases
the horary motion will be to 33'' 10''' 33<sup>iv</sup>. 12<sup>v</sup>. as the solid
content of the sines of the three angles TPI, PTN, and STN (or of the
distances of the moon from the quadrature, of the moon from the node,
and of the node from the sun) to the cube of the radius. And as often
as the sine of any angle is changed from positive to negative, and from
negative to positive, so often must the regressive be changed into
a progressive, and the progressive into a regressive motion. Whence
it comes to pass that the nodes are progressive as often as the moon
happens to be placed between either quadrature, and the node nearest to
that quadrature. In other cases they are regressive, and by the excess
of the regress above the progress, they are monthly transferred <i>in
antecedentia</i>.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if from P and M, the extreme points of a least arc
PM, on the line Q<i>q</i> joining the quadratures we let fall the
perpendiculars PK M<i>k</i>, and produce the same till they cut the
line of the nodes N<i>n</i> in D and <i>d</i>, the horary motion of
the nodes will be as the area MPD<i>d</i>, and the square of the line
AZ conjunctly. For let PK, PH, and AZ, be the three said sines, viz.,
PK the sine of the distance of the moon from the quadrature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</span> PH the
sine of the distance of the moon from the node, and AZ the sine of
the distance of the node from the sun; and the velocity of the node
will be as the solid content of PK × PH × AZ. But PT is to PK as PM to
K<i>k</i>; and, therefore, because PT and PM are given, K<i>k</i> will
be as PK. Likewise AT is to PD as AZ to PH, and therefore PH is as the
rectangle PD × AZ; and, by compounding those proportions, PK × PH is as
the solid content K<i>k</i> × PD × AZ, and PK × PH × AZ as K<i>k</i> ×
PD × AZ<sup>2</sup>; that is, as the area PD<i>d</i>M and AZ<sup>2</sup> conjunctly. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. 2. In any given position of the nodes their mean horary motion is
half their horary motion in the moon's syzygies; and therefore is to
16'' 35''' 16<sup>iv</sup>. 36<sup>v</sup>. as the square of the sine of the distance of
the nodes from the syzygies to the square of the radius, or as AZ<sup>2</sup> to
AT<sup>2</sup>. For if the moon, by an uniform motion, describes the semi-circle
QA<i>q</i>, the sum of all the areas PD<i>d</i>M, during the time of
the moon's passage from Q to M, will make up the area QM<i>d</i>E,
terminating at the tangent QE of the circle; and by the time that the
moon has arrived at the point <i>n</i>, that sum will make up the whole
area EQA<i>n</i> described by the line PD: but when the moon proceeds
from <i>n</i> to <i>q</i>, the line PD will fall without the circle,
and describe the area <i>nqe</i>, terminating at the tangent <i>qe</i>
of the circle, which area, because the nodes were before regressive,
but are now progressive, must be subducted from the former area,
and, being itself equal to the area QEN, will leave the semi-circle
NQA<i>n</i>. While, therefore, the moon describes a semi-circle, the
sum of all the areas PD<i>d</i>M will be the area of that semi-circle;
and while the moon describes a complete circle, the sum of those areas
will be the area of the whole circle. But the area PD<i>d</i>M, when
the moon is in the syzygies, is the rectangle of the arc PM into the
radius PT; and the sum of all the areas, <i>every one</i> equal to this
area, in the time that the moon describes a complete circle, is the
rectangle of the whole circumference into the radius of the circle; and
this rectangle, being double the area of the circle, will be double the
quantity of the former sum.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</span> If, therefore, the nodes went on with that
velocity uniformly continued which they acquire in the moon's syzygies,
they would describe a space double of that which they describe in fact;
and, therefore, the mean motion, by which, if uniformly continued, they
would describe the same space with that which they do in fact describe
by an unequal motion, is <i>but</i> one-half of that motion which they
are possessed of in the moon's syzygies. Wherefore since their greatest
horary motion, if the nodes are in the quadratures, is 33'' 10'''
33<sup>iv</sup>. 12<sup>v</sup>. their mean horary motion in this case will be 16'' 35'''
16<sup>iv</sup>. 36<sup>v</sup>. And seeing the horary motion of the nodes is every where
as AZ<sup>2</sup> and the area PD<i>d</i>M conjunctly, and, therefore, in the
moon's syzygies, the horary motion of the nodes is as AZ<sup>2</sup> and the area
PD<i>d</i>M conjunctly, that is (because the area PD<i>d</i>M described
in the syzygies is given), as AZ<sup>2</sup>, therefore the mean motion also will
be as AZ<sup>2</sup>; and, therefore, when the nodes are without the quadratures,
this motion will be to 16'' 35''' 16<sup>iv</sup>. 36<sup>v</sup>. as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>Let Q<i>pmaq</i> represent an ellipsis described with the greater
axis Q<i>q</i>, and the lesser axis <i>ab</i>; QA<i>q</i>B a circle
circumscribed; T the earth in the common centre of both; S the sun;
<i>p</i> the moon moving in this ellipsis; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</span> <i>pm</i> an arc which
it describes in the least moment of time; N and <i>n</i> the nodes
joined by the line N<i>n</i>; <i>p</i>K and <i>mk</i> perpendiculars
upon the axis Q<i>q</i>, produced both ways till they meet the circle
in P and M, and the line of the nodes in D and <i>d</i>. And if the
moon, by a radius drawn to the earth, describes an area proportional to
the time <i>of description</i>, the horary motion of the node in the
ellipsis will be as the area <i>p</i>D<i>dm</i> and AZ<sup>2</sup> conjunctly.</p>

<p>For let PF touch the circle in P, and produced meet TN in F; and
<i>pf</i> touch the ellipsis in <i>p</i>, and produced meet the same
TN in <i>f</i>, and both tangents concur in the axis TQ at Y. And
let ML represent the space which the moon, by the impulse of the
above-mentioned force 3IT or 3PK, would describe with a transverse
motion, in the meantime while revolving in the circle it describes the
arc PM; and <i>ml</i> denote the space which the moon revolving in the
ellipsis would describe in the same time by the impulse of the same
force 3IT or 3PK; and let LP and <i>lp</i> be produced till they meet
the plane of the ecliptic in G and <i>g</i>, and FG and <i>fg</i> be
joined, of which FG produced may cut <i>pf</i>, <i>pg</i>, and TQ, in
<i>c</i>, <i>e</i>, and R respectively; and <i>fg</i> produced may cut
TQ in <i>r</i>. Because the force 3IT or 3PK in the circle is to the
force 3IT or 3<i>p</i>K in the ellipsis as PK to <i>p</i>K, or as AT to
<i>a</i>T, the space ML generated by the former force will be to the
space <i>ml</i> generated by the latter as PK to <i>p</i>K; that is,
because of the similar figures PYK<i>p</i> and FYR<i>c</i>, as FR to
<i>c</i>R. But (because of the similar triangles PLM, PGF) ML is to FG
as PL to PG, that is (on account of the parallels L<i>k</i>, PK, GR),
as <i>pl</i> to <i>pe</i>, that is (because of the similar triangles
<i>plm</i>, <i>cpe</i>), as <i>lm</i> to <i>ce</i>; and inversely as
LM is to <i>lm</i>, or as FR is to <i>c</i>R, so is FG to <i>ce</i>.
And therefore if <i>fg</i> was to <i>ce</i> as <i>fy</i> to <i>c</i>Y,
that is, as <i>fr</i> to <i>c</i>R (that is, as <i>fr</i> to FR and
FR to <i>c</i>R conjunctly, that is, as <i>f</i>T to FT, and FG to
<i>ce</i> conjunctly), because the ratio of FG to <i>ce</i>, expunged
on both sides, leaves the ratios <i>fg</i> to FG and <i>f</i>T to FT,
<i>fg</i> would be to FG as <i>f</i>T to FT; and, therefore, the angles
which FG and <i>fg</i> would subtend at the earth T would be equal to
each other. But these angles (by what we have shewn in the preceding
Proposition) are the motions of the nodes, while the moon describes in
the circle the arc PM, in the ellipsis the arc <i>pm</i>; and therefore
the motions of the nodes in the circle and in the ellipsis would be
equal to each other. Thus, I say, it would be, if <i>fg</i> was to
<i>ce</i> as <i>f</i>Y to <i>c</i>Y, that is, if <i>fg</i> was equal
to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{ce \times\, f\mathrm Y}{c \mathrm Y}" src="images/1046.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.577ex; width: 9.114ex; height: 4.701ex;" id="img_images_1046.svg">.</span> But because of the

the motion of the nodes in the ellipsis is to the motion of the same
in the circle as this <i>fg</i> or <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{ce \times\, fp}{cp}" src="images/1048.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.991ex; width: 8.555ex; height: 5.115ex;" id="img_images_1048.svg"> to

that is, as <i>fp</i> ×<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</span> <i>c</i>Y to <i>f</i>Y × <i>cp</i>, or
as <i>fp</i> to <i>f</i>Y, and <i>c</i>Y to <i>cp</i>; that is, if
<i>ph</i> parallel to TN meet FP in <i>h</i>, as F<i>h</i> to FY and FY
to FP; that is, as F<i>h</i> to FP or D<i>p</i> to DP, and therefore
as the area D<i>pmd</i> to the area DPM<i>d</i>. And, therefore,
seeing (by Corol. 1, Prop. XXX) the latter area and AZ<sup>2</sup> conjunctly
are proportional to the horary motion of the nodes in the circle, the
former area and AZ<sup>2</sup> conjunctly will be proportional to the horary
motion of the nodes in the ellipsis. Q.E.D.</p>

<p>COR. Since, therefore, in any given position of the nodes, the sum
of all the areas <i>p</i>D<i>dm</i>, in the time while the moon
is carried from the quadrature to any place <i>m</i>, is the area
<i>mp</i>QE<i>d</i> terminated at the tangent of the ellipsis QE; and
the sum of all those areas, in one entire revolution, is the area of
the whole ellipsis; the mean motion of the nodes in the ellipsis will
be to the mean motion of the nodes in the circle as the ellipsis to the
circle; that is, as T<i>a</i> to TA, or 69 to 70. And, therefore, since
(by Corol. 2, Prop. XXX) the mean horary motion of the nodes in the
circle is to 16'' 35''' 16<sup>iv</sup>. 36<sup>v</sup>. as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>, if we take the
angle 16'' 21''' 3<sup>iv</sup>. 30<sup>v</sup>. to the angle 16'' 35''' 16<sup>iv</sup>. 36<sup>v</sup>.
as 69 to 70, the mean horary motion of the nodes in the ellipsis will
be to 16'' 21''' 3<sup>iv</sup>. 30<sup>v</sup>. as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>; that is, as the square
of the sine of the distance of the node from the sun to the square of
the radius.</p>

<p>But the moon, by a radius drawn to the earth, describes the area
in the syzygies with a greater velocity than it does that in the
quadratures, and upon that account the time is contracted in the
syzygies, and prolonged in the quadratures; and together with the time
the motion of the nodes is likewise augmented or diminished. But the
moment of the area in the quadrature of the moon was to the moment
thereof in the syzygies as 10973 to 11073; and therefore the mean
moment in the octants is to the excess in the syzygies, and to the
defect in the quadratures, as 11023, the half sum of those numbers,
to their half difference 50. Wherefore since the time of the moon in
the several little equal parts of its orbit is reciprocally as its
velocity, the mean time in the octants will be to the excess of the
time in the quadratures, and to the defect <i>of the time</i> in the
syzygies arising from this cause, nearly as 11023 to 50. But, reckoning
from the quadratures to the syzygies, I find that the excess of the
moments of the area, in the several places above the least moment in
the quadratures, is nearly as the square of the sine of the moon's
distance from the quadratures; and therefore the difference betwixt
the moment in any place, and the mean moment in the octants, is as
the difference betwixt the square of the sine of the moon's distance
from the quadratures, and the square of the sine of 45 degrees, or
half the square of the radius; and the increment of the time in the
several places between the octants and quadratures, and the decrement
thereof between the octants and syzygies, is in the same proportion.
But the motion of the nodes, while the moon describes the several
little equal parts of its orbit, is accelerated or retarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</span> in the
duplicate proportion of the time; for that motion, while the moon
describes PM, is (<i>cæteris paribus</i>) as ML, and ML is in the
duplicate proportion of the time. Wherefore the motion of the nodes in
the syzygies, in the time while the moon describes given little parts
of its orbit, is diminished in the duplicate proportion of the number
11073 to the number 11023; and the decrement is to the remaining motion
as 100 to 10973; but to the whole motion as 100 to 11073 nearly. But
the decrement in the places between the octants and syzygies, and the
increment in the places between the octants and quadratures, is to
this decrement nearly as the whole motion in these places to the whole
motion in the syzygies, and the difference betwixt the square of the
sine of the moon's distance from the quadrature, and the half square of
the radius, to the half square of the radius conjunctly. Wherefore, if
the nodes are in the quadratures, and we take two places, one on one
side, one on the other, equally distant from the octant and other two
distant by the same interval, one from the syzygy, the other from the
quadrature, and from the decrements of the motions in the two places
between the syzygy and octant we subtract the increments of the motions
in the two other places between the octant and the quadrature, the
remaining decrement will be equal to the decrement in the syzygy, as
will easily appear by computation; and therefore the mean decrement,
which ought to be subducted from the mean motion of the nodes, is the
fourth part of the decrement in the syzygy. The whole horary motion of
the nodes in the syzygies (when the moon by a radius drawn to the earth
was supposed to describe an area proportional to the time) was 32''
42'' 7<sup>iv</sup>. And we have shewn that the decrement of the motion of the
nodes, in the time while the moon, now moving with greater velocity,
describes the same space, was to this motion as 100 to 11073; and
therefore this decrement is 17''' 43<sup>iv</sup>. 11<sup>v</sup>. The fourth part of
which 4''' 25<sup>iv</sup>. 48<sup>v</sup>. subtracted from the mean horary motion above
found, 16'' 21'' 3<sup>iv</sup>. 30<sup>v</sup>. leaves 16'' 16''' 37<sup>iv</sup>. 42<sup>v</sup>. their
correct mean horary motion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</span></p>

<p>If the nodes are without the quadratures, and two places are
considered, one on one side, one on the other, equally distant from
the syzygies, the sum of the motions of the nodes, when the moon is in
those places, will be to the sum of their motions, when the moon is in
the same places and the nodes in the quadratures, as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>. And
the decrements of the motions arising from the causes but now explained
will be mutually as the motions themselves, and therefore the remaining
motions will be mutually betwixt themselves as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>; and the
mean motions will be as the remaining motions. And, therefore, in any
given position of the nodes, their correct mean horary motion is to
16'' 16''' 37<sup>iv</sup>. 42<sup>v</sup>. as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>; that is, as the square of
the sine of the distance of the nodes from the syzygies to the square
of the radius.</p>

<p>The yearly mean motion is the sum of all the mean horary motions
throughout the course of the year. Suppose that the node is in N, and
that, after every hour is elapsed, it is drawn back again to its former
place; so that, notwithstanding its proper motion, it may constantly
remain in the same situation with respect to the fixed stars; while in
the mean time the sun S, by the motion of the earth, is seen to leave
the node, and to proceed till it completes its apparent annual course
by an uniform motion. Let A<i>a</i> represent a given least arc, which
the right line TS always drawn to the sun, by its intersection with the
circle NA<i>n</i>, describes in the least given moment of time; and the
mean horary motion (from what we have above shewn) will be as AZ<sup>2</sup>,
that is (because AZ and ZY are proportional), as the rectangle of AZ
into ZY, that is, as the area AZY<i>a</i>; and the sum of all the mean
horary motions from the beginning will be as the sum of all the areas
<i>a</i>YZA, that is, as the area NAZ. But the greatest AZY<i>a</i>
is equal to the rectangle of the arc A<i>a</i> into the radius of the
circle; and therefore the sum of all these rectangles in the whole
circle will be to the like sum of all the greatest rectangles as the
area of the whole circle to the rectangle of the whole circumference
into the radius, that is, as 1 to 2. But the horary motion
corresponding to that greatest rectangle was 16'' 16''' 37<sup>iv</sup>. 42<sup>v</sup>.
and this motion in the complete course of the sidereal year, 365<sup>d</sup>.
6<sup>h</sup>. 9', amounts to 39° 38' 7'' 50''', and therefore the half thereof,
19° 49' 3'' 55''', is the mean motion of the nodes corresponding to the
whole circle. And the motion of the nodes, in the time while the sun
is carried from N to A, is to 19° 49' 3'' 55'' as the area NAZ to the
whole circle.</p>

<p>Thus it would be if the node was after every hour drawn back again to
its former place, that so, after a complete revolution, the sun at the
year's end would be found again in the same node which it had left when
the year begun. But, because of the motion of the node in the mean
time, the sun must needs meet the node sooner; and now it remains that
we compute the abbreviation of the time. Since, then, the sun, in the
course of the year, travels 360 degrees, and the node in the same time
by its greatest motion would be carried 39° 38' 7'' 50''', or 39,6355
degrees; and the mean motion of the node in any place N is to its mean
motion in its quadratures as AZ<sup>2</sup> to AT<sup>2</sup>; the motion of the sun will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</span>be to the motion of the node in N as 360AT<sup>2</sup> to 39·6355AZ<sup>2</sup>; that is,
as 9,0827646AT<sup>2</sup> to AZ<sup>2</sup>. Wherefore if we suppose the circumference
NA<i>n</i> of the whole circle to be divided into little equal parts,
such as A<i>a</i>, the time in which the sun would describe the little
arc A<i>a</i>, if the circle was quiescent, will be to the time of
which it would describe the same arc, supposing the circle together
with the nodes to be revolved about the centre T, reciprocally as
9,0827646AT<sup>2</sup> to 9,0827646AT<sup>2</sup> + AZ<sup>2</sup>; for the time is reciprocally as
the velocity with which the little arc is described, and this velocity
is the sum of the velocities of both sun and node. If, therefore, the
sector NTA represent the time in which the sun by itself, without the
motion of the node, would describe the arc NA, and the indefinitely

that is to say, that <i>d</i>Z may be to <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{AZ}" src="images/1049.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.875ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1049.svg">
as AT<sup>2</sup> to 9,0827646AT<sup>2</sup> + AZ<sup>2</sup>; the rectangle of <i>d</i>Z into ZY
will represent the decrement of the time arising from the motion of
the node, while the arc A<i>a</i> is described; and if the curve
N<i>d</i>G<i>n</i> is the locus where the point <i>d</i> is always
found, the curvilinear area N<i>d</i>Z will be as the whole decrement
<i>of time</i> while the whole arc NA is described; and, therefore,
the excess of the sector NAT above the area N<i>d</i>Z will be as
the whole time. But because the motion of the node in a less time is
less in proportion of the time, the area A<i>a</i>YZ must also be
diminished in the same proportion; which may be done by taking in AZ
the line <i>e</i>Z of such length, that it may be to the length of AZ
as AZ<sup>2</sup> to 9,0827646AT<sup>2</sup> + AZ<sup>2</sup>; for so the rectangle of <i>e</i>Z
into ZY will be to the area AZY<i>a</i> as the decrement of the time
in which the arc A<i>a</i> is described to the whole time in which
it would have been described, if the node had been quiescent; and,
therefore, that rectangle will be as the decrement of the motion of
the node. And if the curve N<i>e</i>F<i>n</i> is the locus of the
point <i>e</i>, the whole area N<i>e</i>Z, which is the sum of all
the decrements <i>of that motion</i>, will be as the whole decrement
<i>thereof</i> during the time in which the arc AN is described; and
the remaining area NA<i>e</i> will be as the remaining motion, which is
the true motion of the node, during the time in which the whole arc NA
is described by the joint motions of both sun and node. Now the area
of the semi-circle is to the area of the figure N<i>e</i>F<i>n</i>
found by the method of infinite series nearly as 793 to 60. But the
motion corresponding <i>or proportional</i> to the whole circle was
19° 49' 3'' 55'''; and therefore the motion corresponding to double
the figure N<i>e</i>F<i>n</i> is 1° 29' 58'' 2''', which taken from
the former motion leaves 18° 19' 5'' 53''', the whole motion of the
node with respect to the fixed stars in the interval between two of its
conjunctions with the sun; and this motion subducted from the annual
motion of the sun 360°, leaves 341° 40' 54'' 7''',<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</span> the motion of the
sun in the interval between the same conjunctions. But as this motion
is to the annual motion 360°, so is the motion of the node but just
now found 18° 19' 5'' 53''' to its annual motion, which will therefore
be 19° 18' 1'' 23'''; and this is the mean motion of the nodes in the
sidereal year. By astronomical tables, it is 19° 21' 21'' 50'''. The
difference is less than <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{300}" src="images/1050.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1050.svg"> part of the whole motion,
and seems to arise from the eccentricity of the moon's orbit, and its
inclination to the plane of the ecliptic. By the eccentricity of this
orbit the motion of the nodes is too much accelerated; and, on the
other hand, by the inclination of the orbit, the motion of the nodes is
something retarded, and reduced to its just velocity.</p>

because the calculus is too difficult, it will be better to use the

interval CD, describe the circle BEFD; produce DC to A so as AB may be
to AC as the mean motion to half the mean true motion when the nodes
are in their quadratures (that is, as 19° 18' 1'' 23''' to 19° 49'
3'' 55'''; and therefore BC to AC as the difference of those motions
0° 31' 2'' 32''' to the latter motion 19° 49' 3'' 55'', that is, as 1

line G<i>g</i>, touching the circle in D; and if we take the angle
BCE, or BCF, equal to the double distance of the sun from the place of
the node, as found by the mean motion, and drawing AE or AF cutting
the perpendicular DG in G, we take another angle which shall be to the
whole motion of the node in the interval between its syzygies (that is,
to 9° 11'' 3''') as the tangent DG to the whole circumference of the
circle BED, and add this <i>last</i> angle (for which the angle DAG
may be used) to the mean motion of the nodes, while they are passing
from the quadratures to the syzygies, and subtract it from their mean
motion while they are passing from the syzygies to the quadratures, we
shall have their true motion; for the true motion so found will nearly
agree with the true motion which comes out from assuming the times
as the area NTA - N<i>d</i>Z, and the motion of the node as the area
NA<i>e</i>; as whoever will please to examine and make the computations
will find: and this is the semi-menstrual equation of the motion of the
nodes. But there is also a menstrual equation, but which is by no means
necessary for finding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</span> of the moon's latitude; for since the variation
of the inclination of the moon's orbit to the plane of the ecliptic
is liable to a twofold inequality, the one semi-menstrual, the other
menstrual, the menstrual inequality <i>of this variation</i>, and the
menstrual equation of the nodes, so moderate and correct each other,
that in computing the latitude of the moon both may be neglected.</p>

<p>COR. From this and the preceding Prop. it appears that the nodes are
quiescent in their syzygies, but regressive in their quadratures, by
an hourly motion of 16'' 19''' 26<sup>iv</sup>.; and that the equation of the
motion of the nodes in the octants is 1° 30'; all which exactly agree
with the phænomena of the heavens.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Machin</i>, Astron., Prof. Gresh., and Dr. <i>Henry

different method. Mention has been made of this method in another
place. Their several papers, both of which I have seen, contained two

about the centre with the same angular velocity with which the sun and
the node recede from one another, in such sort that the angle between
the quiescent right line N<i>n</i> and the revolving line TA may be
always equal to the distance of the places of the sun and node. Now if
any right line TK be divided into parts TS and SK, and those parts be
taken as the mean horary motion of the sun to the mean horary motion of
the node in the quadratures, and there be taken the right line TH, a
mean proportional between the part TS and the whole TK, this right line
will be proportional to the sun's mean motion from the node.</p>

<p>"For let there be described the circle NK<i>n</i>M from the centre T
and with the radius TK, and about the same centre, with the semi-axis

time in which the sun recedes from the node through the arc N<i>a</i>,
if there be drawn the right line T<i>ba</i>, the area of the sector
NT<i>a</i> will be the exponent of the sum of the motions of the sun

to the aforesaid law, will uniformly describe in a given particle of
time, and the extremely small sector TA<i>a</i> will be as the sum of
the velocities with which the sun and node are carried two different
ways in that time. Now the sun's velocity is almost uniform, its
inequality being so small as scarcely to produce the least inequality
in the mean motion of the nodes. The other part of this sum, namely,
the mean quantity of the velocity of the node, is increased in the
recess from the syzygies in a duplicate ratio of the sine of its
distance from the sun (by Cor. Prop. XXXI, of this Book), and, being
greatest in its quadratures with the sun in K, is in the same ratio
to the sun's velocity as SK to TS, that is, as (the difference of the
squares of TK and TH, or) the rectangle KHM to TH<sup>2</sup>. But the ellipsis

velocities, into two parts AB<i>ba</i> and BT<i>b</i>, proportional
to the velocities. For produce BT to the circle in <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\beta" src="images/1052.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" id="img_images_1052.svg">,</span> and

in that very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</span> ratio to the velocity of the sun; and therefore in the
quadratures the sector AT<i>a</i> is divided into parts proportional to

which the sun hath been going over the arc NA since he left the node;
and the remaining space, namely, the elliptic sector NTB, will be as
the sun's mean motion in the same time. And because the mean annual
motion of the node is that motion which it performs in the time that
the sun completes one period of its course, the mean motion of the
node from the sun will be to the mean motion of the sun itself as the
area of the circle to the area of the ellipsis; that is, as the right

EB to twice BA. And if to the time given we set off the angle AEG equal
to double the distance of the nodes from the quadratures, and upon AD
let fall the perpendicular GH, AH will be the sine of the inclination
required.</p>

<p>In this demonstration I have supposed that the angle BEG, representing
double the distance of the nodes from the quadratures, increaseth
uniformly; for I cannot descend to every minute circumstance of
inequality. Now suppose that BEG is a right angle, and that G<i>g</i>
is in this case the horary increment of double the distance of the
nodes from the sun; then, by Cor. 3 of the last Prop. the horary
variation of the inclination in the same case will be to 33'' 10'''

sine of the right angle BEG, double the distance of the nodes from

896 to 40000, the quadruple of the radius, or as 224 to 10000. But
the whole variation corresponding to BD, the difference of the sines,
is to this horary variation as the diameter BD to the arc G<i>g</i>,
that is, conjunctly as the diameter BD to the semi-circumference BGD,
and as the time of <img alt="" data-tex="2079\tfrac{7}{10}" src="images/1070.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 7.12ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_1070.svg"> hours, in which the node

<p>And this is the greatest variation of the inclination, abstracting
from the situation of the moon in its orbit; for if the nodes are
in the syzygies, the inclination suffers no change from the various
positions of the moon. But if the nodes are in the quadratures, the
inclination is less when the moon is in the syzygies than when it is in
the quadratures by a difference of 2' 43'', as we shewed in Cor. 4 of
the preceding Prop.; and the whole mean variation BD, diminished by 1'
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="21\tfrac{1}{2}''" src="images/1073.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1073.svg">,</span> the half of this excess, becomes 15' 2'', when
the moon is in the quadratures; and increased by the same, becomes 17'
45'' when the moon is in the syzygies. If, therefore, the moon be in
the syzygies, the whole variation in the passage of the nodes from the
quadratures to the syzygies will be 17' 45''; and, therefore, if the
inclination be 5° 17' 20'', when the nodes are in the syzygies, it will
be 4° 59' 35'' when the nodes are in the quadratures and the moon in
the syzygies. The truth of all which is confirmed by observations.</p>

<p>Now if the inclination of the orbit should be required when the moon
is in the syzygies, and the nodes any where between them and the
quadratures, let AB be to AD as the sine of 4° 59' 35" to the sine
of 5° 17' 20'', and take the angle AEG equal to double the distance
of the nodes from the quadratures; and AH will be the sine of the
inclination desired. To this inclination of the orbit the inclination
of the same is equal, when the moon is 90° distant from the nodes.
In other situations of the moon, this menstrual inequality, to which
the variation of the inclination is obnoxious in the calculus of
the moon's latitude, is balanced, and in a manner took off, by the
menstrual inequality of the motion of the nodes (as we said before),
and therefore may be neglected in the computation of the said latitude.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>By these computations of the lunar motions I was willing to shew that
by the theory of gravity the motions of the moon could be calculated
from their physical causes. By the same theory I moreover found that
the annual equation of the mean motion of the moon arises from the
various<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</span> dilatation which the orbit of the moon suffers from the action
of the sun according to Cor. 6, Prop. LXVI. Book I. The force of this
action is greater in the perigeon sun, and dilates the moon's orbit;
in the apogeon sun it is less, and permits the orbit to be again
contracted. The moon moves slower in the dilated and faster in the
contracted orbit; and the annual equation, by which this inequality is
regulated, vanishes in the apogee and perigee of the sun. In the mean
distance of the sun from the earth it arises to about 11' 50''; in
other distances of the sun it is proportional to the equation of the
sun's centre, and is added to the mean motion of the moon, while the
earth is passing from its aphelion to its perihelion, and subducted
while the earth is in the opposite semi-circle. Taking for the radius
of the <i>orbis magnus</i> 1000, and <img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{7}{8}" src="images/1074.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_1074.svg"> for the earth's
eccentricity, this equation, when of the greatest magnitude, by the
theory of gravity comes out 11' 49''. But the eccentricity of the earth
seems to be something greater, and with the eccentricity this equation
will be augmented in the same proportion. Suppose the eccentricity
<img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{11}{12}" src="images/1075.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1075.svg"> and the greatest equation will be 11' 51''.</p>

<p>Farther; I found that the apogee and nodes of the moon move faster
in the perihelion of the earth, where the force of the sun's action
is greater, than in the aphelion thereof, and that in the reciprocal
triplicate proportion of the earth's distance from the sun; and hence
arise annual equations of those motions proportional to the equation
of the sun's centre. Now the motion of the sun is in the reciprocal
duplicate proportion of the earth's distance from the sun; and the
greatest equation of the centre which this inequality generates is 1°
56' 20'', corresponding to the above-mentioned eccentricity of the sun,
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{11}{12}" src="images/1075.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1075.svg_1">.</span> But if the motion of the sun had been in the
reciprocal triplicate proportion of the distance, this inequality would
have generated the greatest equation 2° 54' 30''; and therefore the
greatest equations which the inequalities of the motions of the moon's
apogee and nodes do generate are to 2° 54' 30'' as the mean diurnal
motion of the moon's apogee and the mean diurnal motion of its nodes
are to the mean diurnal motion of the sun. Whence the greatest equation
of the mean motion of the apogee comes out 19' 43'', and the greatest
equation of the mean motion of the nodes 9' 24''. The former equation
is added, and the latter subducted, while the earth is passing from its
perihelion to its aphelion, and contrariwise when the earth is in the
opposite semi-circle.</p>

<p>By the theory of gravity I likewise found that the action of the
sun upon the moon is something greater when the transverse diameter
of the moon's orbit passeth through the sun than when the same is
perpendicular upon the line which joins the earth and the sun; and
therefore the moon's orbit is something larger in the former than in
the latter case. And hence arises another equation of the moon's mean
motion, depending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</span> upon the situation of the moon's apogee in respect
of the sun, which is in its greatest quantity when the moon's apogee
is in the octants of the sun, and vanishes when the apogee arrives at
the quadratures or syzygies; and it is added to the mean motion while
the moon's apogee is passing from the quadrature of the sun to the
syzygy, and subducted while the apogee is passing from the syzygy to
the quadrature. This equation, which I shall call the semi-annual,
when greatest in the octants of the apogee, arises to about 3' 45'',
so far as I could collect from the phænomena: and this is its quantity
in the mean distance of the sun from the earth. But it is increased
and diminished in the reciprocal triplicate proportion of the sun's
distance, and therefore is nearly 3' 34'' when that distance is
greatest, and 3' 56'' when least. But when the moon's apogee is without
the octants, it becomes less, and is to its greatest quantity as the
sine of double the distance of the moon's apogee from the nearest
syzygy or quadrature to the radius.</p>

<p>By the same theory of gravity, the action of the sun upon the moon is
something greater when the line of the moon's nodes passes through the
sun than when it is at right angles with the line which joins the sun
and the earth; and hence arises another equation of the moon's mean
motion, which I shall call the second semi-annual; and this is greatest
when the nodes are in the octants of the sun, and vanishes when they
are in the syzygies or quadratures; and in other positions of the nodes
is proportional to the sine of double the distance of either node from
the nearest syzygy or quadrature. And it is added to the mean motion
of the moon, if the sun is <i>in antecedentia</i>, to the node which
is nearest to him, and subducted if <i>in consequentia</i>; and in the
octants, where it is of the greatest magnitude, it arises to 47'' in
the mean distance of the sun from the earth, as I find from the theory
of gravity. In other distances of the sun, this equation, greatest in
the octants of the nodes, is reciprocally as the cube of the sun's
distance from the earth; and therefore in the sun's perigee it comes to
about 49'', and in its apogee to about 45''.</p>

<p>By the same theory of gravity, the moon's apogee goes forward at the
greatest rate when it is either in conjunction with or in opposition to
the sun, but in its quadratures with the sun it goes backward; and the
eccentricity comes, in the former case, to its greatest quantity; in
the latter to its least, by Cor. 7, 8, and 9, Prop. LXVI, Book I. And
those inequalities, by the Corollaries we have named, are very great,
and generate the principal which I call the semi-annual equation of the
apogee; and this semi-annual equation in its greatest quantity comes
to about 12° 18', as nearly as I could collect from the phænomena. Our
countryman, <i>Horrox</i>, was the first who advanced the theory of the
moon's moving in an ellipsis about the earth placed in its lower focus.
Dr. <i>Halley</i> improved the notion, by putting the centre of the
ellipsis in an epicycle whose centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</span> is uniformly revolved about the
earth; and from the motion in this epicycle the mentioned inequalities
in the progress and regress of the apogee, and in the quantity of
eccentricity, do arise.</p>

<p class="nind">
Suppose the mean distance of the moon from the earth to be divided into
100000 parts, and let T represent the earth, and TC the moon's mean
eccentricity of 5505 such parts. Produce TC to B, so as CB may be the
sine of the greatest semi-annual equation 12° 18' to the radius TC; and
the circle BDA described about the centre C, with the interval CB, will
be the epicycle spoken of, in which the centre of the moon's orbit is
placed, and revolved according to the order of the letters BDA. Set off
the angle BCD equal to twice the annual argument, or twice the distance
of the sun's true place from the place of the moon's apogee once
equated, and CTD will be the semi-annual equation of the moon's apogee,
and TD the eccentricity of its orbit, tending to the place of the
apogee now twice equated. But, having the moon's mean motion, the place
of its apogee, and its eccentricity, as well as the longer axis of its
orbit 200000, from these <i>data</i> the true place of the moon in its
orbit, together with its distance from the earth, may be determined by
the methods commonly known.</p>

<p>In the perihelion of the earth, where the force of the sun is greatest,
the centre of the moon's orbit moves faster about the centre C than in
the aphelion, and that in the reciprocal triplicate proportion of the
sun's distance from the earth. But, because the equation of the sun's
centre is included in the annual argument, the centre of the moon's
orbit moves faster in its epicycle BDA, in the reciprocal duplicate
proportion of the sun's distance from the earth. Therefore, that it may
move yet faster in the reciprocal simple proportion of the distance,
suppose that from D, the centre of the orbit, a right line DE is drawn,
tending towards the moon's apogee once equated, that is, parallel to
TC; and set off the angle EDF equal to the excess of the aforesaid
annual argument above the distance of the moon's apogee from the sun's
perigee <i>in consequentia</i>; or, which comes to the same thing,
take the angle CDF equal to the complement of the sun's true anomaly
to 360°; and let DF be to DC as twice the eccentricity of the <i>orbis
magnus</i> to the sun's mean distance from the earth, and the sun's
mean diurnal motion from the moon's apogee to the sun's mean diurnal
motion from its own apogee conjunctly, that is, as <img alt="" data-tex="33\tfrac{7}{8}" src="images/1076.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_1076.svg">
to 1000, and 52' 27'' 16''' to 59' 8'' 10''' conjunctly, or as 3 to
100; and imagine the centre of the moon's orbit placed in the point F
to be revolved in an epicycle whose centre is D, and radius DF, while
the point D moves in the circumference of the circle DABD: for by this
means the centre of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</span> the moon's orbit comes to describe a certain
curve line about the centre C with a velocity which will be almost
reciprocally as the cube of the sun's distance from the earth, as it
ought to be.</p>

<p>The calculus of this motion is difficult, but may be rendered more easy
by the following approximation. Assuming, as above, the moon's mean
distance from the earth of 100000 parts, and the eccentricity TC of
5505 such parts, the line CB or CD will be found <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="1172\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/1077.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 6.32ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_1077.svg">,</span>
and DF <img alt="" data-tex="35\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/1078.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1078.svg"> of those parts; and this line DF at the
distance TC subtends the angle at the earth, which the removal of
the centre of the orbit from the place D to the place F generates
in the motion of this centre; and double this line DF in a parallel
position, at the distance of the upper focus of the moon's orbit from
the earth, subtends at the earth the same angle as DF did before, which
that removal generates in the motion of this upper focus; but at the
distance of the moon from the earth this double line 2DF at the upper
focus, in a parallel position to the first line DF, subtends an angle
at the moon, which the said removal generates in the motion of the
moon, which angle may be therefore called the second equation of the
moon's centre; and this equation, in the mean distance of the moon
from the earth, is nearly as the sine of the angle which that line DF
contains with the line drawn from the point F to the moon, and when in
its greatest quantity amounts to 2' 25". But the angle which the line
DF contains with the line drawn from the point F to the moon is found
either by subtracting the angle EDF from the mean anomaly of the moon,
or by adding the distance of the moon from the sun to the distance of
the moon's apogee from the apogee of the sun; and as the radius to the
sine of the angle thus found, so is 2' 25'' to the second equation
of the centre: to be added, if the forementioned sum be less than a
semi-circle; to be subducted, if greater. And from the moon's place in
its orbit thus corrected, its longitude may be found in the syzygies of
the luminaries.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the earth to the height of 35 or 40 miles refracts
the sun's light. This refraction scatters and spreads the light over
the earth's shadow; and the dissipated light near the limits of the
shadow dilates the shadow. Upon which account, to the diameter of the
shadow, as it comes out by the parallax, I add 1 or <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/1015.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1015.svg_1">
minute in lunar eclipses.</p>

<p>But the theory of the moon ought to be examined and proved from the
phænomena, first in the syzygies, then in the quadratures, and last
of all in the octants; and whoever pleases to undertake the work will
find it not amiss to assume the following mean motions of the sun and
moon at the Royal Observatory of <i>Greenwich</i>, to the last day of
<i>December</i> at noon, <i>anno</i> 1700, O.S. viz. The mean motion

<p class="nindc"><i>To find the force of the sun to move the sea.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The sun's force ML or PT to disturb the motions of the moon, was (by
Prop. XXV.) in the moon's quadratures, to the force of gravity with us,
as 1 to 638092,6; and the force TM - LM or 2PK in the moon's syzygies
is double that quantity. But, descending to the surface of the earth,
these forces are diminished in proportion of the distances from the
centre of the earth, that is, in the proportion of <img alt="" data-tex="60\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/968.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_968.svg_5">
to 1; and therefore the former force on the earth's surface is to
the force of gravity as 1 to 38604600; and by this force the sea is
depressed in such places as are 90 degrees distant from the sun. But by
the other force, which is twice as great, the sea is raised not only in
the places directly under the sun, but in those also which are directly
opposed to it; and the sum of these forces is to the force of gravity
as 1 to 12868200. And because the same force excites the same motion,
whether it depresses the waters in those places which are 90 degrees
distant from the sun, or raises them in the places which are directly
under and directly opposed to the sun, the aforesaid sum will be the
total force of the sun to disturb the sea, and will have the same
effect as if the whole was employed in raising the sea in the places
directly under and directly opposed to the sun, and did not act at all
in the places which are 90 degrees removed from the sun.</p>

<p>And this is the force of the sun to disturb the sea in any given place,
where the sun is at the same time both vertical, and in its mean
distance from the earth. In other positions of the sun, its force to
raise the sea is as the versed sine of double its altitude above the
horizon of the place directly, and the cube of the distance from the
earth reciprocally.</p>

<p>COR. Since the centrifugal force of the parts of the earth, arising
from the earth's diurnal motion, which is to the force of gravity as 1
to 289, raises the waters under the equator to a height exceeding that
under the poles by 85472 <i>Paris</i> feet, as above, in Prop. XIX.,
the force of the sun, which we have now shewed to be to the force of
gravity as 1 to 12868200, and therefore is to that centrifugal force as
289 to 12868200, or as 1 to 44527, will be able to raise the waters in
the places directly under and directly opposed to the sun to a height
exceeding that in the places which are 90 degrees removed from the sun
only by one <i>Paris</i> foot and <img alt="" data-tex="113\tfrac{1}{30}" src="images/1079.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1079.svg"> inches; for this

<i>To find the force of the moon to move the sea.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The force of the moon to move the sea is to be deduced from its
proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</span> to the force of the sun, and this proportion is to be
collected from the proportion of the motions of the sea, which are the
effects of those forces. Before the mouth of the river <i>Avon</i>,
three miles below <i>Bristol</i>, the height of the ascent of the
water in the vernal and autumnal syzygies of the luminaries (by the
observations of <i>Samuel Sturmy</i>) amounts to about 45 feet, but in
the quadratures to 25 only. The former of those heights arises from
the sum of the aforesaid forces, the latter from their difference. If,
therefore, S and L are supposed to represent respectively the forces
of the sun and moon while they are in the equator, as well as in their
mean distances from the earth, we shall have L + S to L - S as 45 to
25, or as 9 to 5.</p>

<p>At <i>Plymouth</i> (by the observations of <i>Samuel Colepress</i>)
the tide in its mean height rises to about 16 feet, and in the
spring and autumn the height thereof in the syzygies may exceed that
in the quadratures by more than 7 or 8 feet. Suppose the greatest
difference of those heights to be 9 feet, and L + S will be to L - S as
<img alt="" data-tex="20\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1080.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1080.svg"> to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="11\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1081.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1081.svg">,</span> or as 41 to 23; a proportion
that agrees well enough with the former. But because of the great tide
at <i>Bristol</i>, we are rather to depend upon the observations of
<i>Sturmy</i>; and, therefore, till we procure something that is more
certain, we shall use the proportion of 9 to 5.</p>

<p>But because of the reciprocal motions of the waters, the greatest tides
do not happen at the times of the syzygies of the luminaries, but, as
we have said before, are the third in order after the syzygies; or
(reckoning from the syzygies) follow next after the third appulse of
the moon to the meridian of the place after the syzygies; or rather
(as <i>Sturmy</i> observes) are the third after the day of the new or
full moon, or rather nearly after the twelfth hour from the new or full
moon, and therefore fall nearly upon the forty-third hour after the new
or full of the moon. But in this port they fall out about the seventh
hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian of the place; and
therefore follow next after the appulse of the moon to the meridian,
when the moon is distant from the sun, or from opposition with the sun
by about 18 or 19 degrees <i>in consequentia</i>. So the summer and
winter seasons come not to their height in the solstices themselves,
but when the sun is advanced beyond the solstices by about a tenth
part of its whole course, that is, by about 36 or 37 degrees. In like
manner, the greatest tide is raised after the appulse of the moon to
the meridian of the place, when the moon has passed by the sun, <i>or
the opposition thereof</i>, by about a tenth part of the whole motion
from <i>one greatest</i> tide to <i>the next following greatest</i>
tide. Suppose that distance about <img alt="" data-tex="18\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/641.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_641.svg_2"> degrees; and
the sun's force in this distance of the moon from the syzygies and
quadratures will be of less moment to augment and diminish that part of
the motion of the sea which proceeds from the motion of the moon than
in the syzygies and quadratures themselves in the proportion of the
radius to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</span> the co-sine of double this distance, or of an angle of 37
degrees; that is in proportion of 10000000 to 7986355; and, therefore,
in the preceding analogy, in place of S we must put 0,7986355S.</p>

<p>But farther; the force of the moon in the quadratures must be
diminished, on account of its declination from the equator; for the
moon in those quadratures, or rather in <img alt="" data-tex="18\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/641.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_641.svg_3"> degrees
past the quadratures, declines from the equator by about 23° 13';
and the force of either luminary to move the sea is diminished as it
declines from the equator nearly in the duplicate proportion of the
co-sine of the declination; and therefore the force of the moon in
those quadratures is only 0,8570327L; whence we have L + 0,7986355S to
0,8570327L - 0,7986355S as 9 to 5.</p>

<p>Farther yet; the diameters of the orbit in which the moon should move,
setting aside the consideration of eccentricity, are one to the other
as 69 to 70; and therefore the moon's distance from the earth in the
syzygies is to its distance in the quadratures, <i>cæteris paribus</i>,
as 69 to 70; and its distances, when <img alt="" data-tex="18\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/641.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_641.svg_4"> degrees
advanced beyond the syzygies, where the greatest tide was excited, and
when <img alt="" data-tex="18\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/641.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_641.svg_5"> degrees passed by the quadratures, where the

sea is in the reciprocal triplicate proportion of its distance; and
therefore its forces, in the greatest and least of those distances,
are to its force in its mean distance as 0,9830427 and 1,017522 to 1.
From whence we have 1,017522L × 0,7986355S to 0,9830427 × 0,8570327L
- 0,7986355S as 9 to 5; and S to L as 1 to 4,4815. Wherefore since
the force of the sun is to the force of gravity as 1 to 12868200, the
moon's force will be to the force of gravity as 1 to 2871400.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Since the waters excited by the sun's force rise to the
height of a foot and <img alt="" data-tex="11\tfrac{1}{30}" src="images/1083.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1083.svg"> inches, the moon's force
will raise the same to the height of 8 feet and <img alt="" data-tex="7\tfrac{5}{22}" src="images/1084.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1084.svg">
inches; and the joint forces of both will raise the same to the height
of <img alt="" data-tex="10\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/636.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_636.svg_3"> feet; and when the moon is in its perigee to
the height of <img alt="" data-tex="12\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1085.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1085.svg"> feet, and more, especially when the
wind sets the same way as the tide. And a force of that quantity is
abundantly sufficient to excite all the motions of the sea, and agrees
well with the proportion of those motions; for in such seas as lie
free and open from east to west, as in the <i>Pacific</i> sea, and in
those tracts of the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Æthiopic</i> seas which
lie without the tropics, the waters commonly rise to 6, 9, 12, or 15
feet; but in the <i>Pacific</i> sea, which is of a greater depth, as
well as of a larger extent, the tides are said to be greater than in
the <i>Atlantic</i> and <i>Æthiopic</i> seas; for to have a full tide
raised, an extent of sea from east to west is required of no less than
90 degrees. In the <i>Æthiopic</i> sea, the waters rise to a less
height within the tropics than in the temperate zones, because of the
narrowness of the sea between <i>Africa</i> and the southern parts of
<i>America</i>. In the middle of the open sea the waters cannot rise
without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</span> falling together, and at the same time, upon both the eastern
and western shores, when, notwithstanding, in our narrow seas, they
ought to fall on those shores by alternate turns; upon which account
there is commonly but a small flood and ebb in such islands as lie far
distant from the continent. On the contrary, in some ports, where to
fill and empty the bays alternately the waters are with great violence
forced in and out through shallow channels, the flood and ebb must be
greater than ordinary; as at <i>Plymouth</i> and <i>Chepstow Bridge</i>
in <i>England</i>, at the mountains of St. <i>Michael</i>, and the
town of <i>Avranches</i>, in <i>Normandy</i>, and at <i>Cambaia</i>
and <i>Pegu</i> in the <i>East Indies</i>. In these places the sea
is hurried in and out with such violence, as sometimes to lay the
shores under water, sometimes to leave them dry for many miles. Nor
is this force of the influx and efflux to be broke till it has raised
and depressed the waters to 30, 40, or 50 feet and above. And a like
account is to be given of long and shallow channels or straits, such
as the <i>Magellanic</i> straits, and those channels which environ
<i>England</i>. The tide in such ports and straits, by the violence of
the influx and efflux, is augmented above measure. But on such shores
as lie towards the deep and open sea with a steep descent, where the
waters may freely rise and fall without that precipitation of influx
and efflux, the proportion of the tides agrees with the forces of the
sun and moon.</p>

<p>COR. 2. Since the moon's force to move the sea is to the force of
gravity as 1 to 2871400, it is evident that this force is far less than
to appear sensibly in statical or hydrostatical experiments, or even
in those of pendulums. It is in the tides only that this force shews
itself by any sensible effect.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Because the force of the moon to move the sea is to the like
force of the sun as 4,4815 to 1, and those forces (by Cor. 14, Prop.
LXVI, Book I) are as the densities of the bodies of the sun and moon
and the cubes of their apparent diameters conjunctly, the density of
the moon will be to the density of the sun as 4,4815 to 1 directly,
and the cube of the moon's diameter to the cube of the sun's diameter
inversely; that is (seeing the mean apparent diameters of the moon and
sun are 31' <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{1}{2}''" src="images/1086.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1086.svg">,</span> and 32' 12''), as 4891 to 1000. But
the density of the sun was to the density of the earth as 1000 to 4000;
and therefore the density of the moon is to the density of the earth
as 4891 to 4000, or as 11 to 9. Therefore the body of the moon is more
dense and more earthly than the earth itself.</p>

<p>COR. 4. And since the true diameter of the moon (from the observations
of astronomers) is to the true diameter of the earth as 100 to 365, the
mass of matter in the moon will be to the mass of matter in the earth
as 1 to 39,788.</p>

<p>COR. 5. And the accelerative gravity on the surface of the moon will
be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</span> about three times less than the accelerative gravity on the surface
of the earth.</p>

<p>COR. 6. And the distance of the moon's centre from the centre of the
earth will be to the distance of the moon's centre from the common
centre of gravity of the earth and moon as 40,788 to 39,788.</p>

<p>COR. 7. And the mean distance of the centre of the moon from the centre
of the earth will be (in the moon's octants) nearly <img alt="" data-tex="60\tfrac{2}{5}" src="images/966.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_966.svg_1">
of the greatest semi-diameters of the earth; for the greatest
semi-diameter of the earth was 19658600 <i>Paris</i> feet, and the
mean distance of the centres of the earth and moon, consisting of
60<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{2}{5}" src="images/692.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_692.svg_2"> such semi-diameters, is equal to 1187379440 feet.
And this distance (by the preceding Cor.) is to the distance of the
moon's centre from the common centre of gravity of the earth and moon
as 40,788 to 39,788; which latter distance, therefore, is 1158268534
feet. And since the moon, in respect of the fixed stars, performs
its revolution in 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="43\tfrac{4}{9}'" src="images/1087.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.686ex; height: 3.069ex;" id="img_images_1087.svg">,</span> the versed sine of
that angle which the moon in a minute of time describes is 12752341
to the radius 1000,000000,000000; and as the radius is to this versed
sine, so are 1158268534 feet to 14,7706353 feet. The moon, therefore,
falling towards the earth by that force which retains it in its
orbit, would in one minute of time describe 14,7706353 feet; and if
we augment this force in the proportion of <img alt="" data-tex="178\tfrac{29}{40}" src="images/963.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_963.svg_3"> to

orbit of the moon, by Cor. Prop. III; and the moon falling by this
force, in one minute of time would describe 14,8538067 feet. And at
the 60th part of the distance of the moon from the earth's centre,
that is, at the distance of 197896573 feet from the centre of the
earth, a body falling by its weight, would, in one second of time,
likewise describe 14,8538067 feet. And, therefore, at the distance of
19615800, which compose one mean semi-diameter of the earth, a heavy
body would describe in falling 15,11175, or 15 feet, 1 inch, and
<img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{4}{11}" src="images/1088.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.755ex;" id="img_images_1088.svg"> lines, in the same time. This will be the descent of
bodies in the latitude of 45 degrees. And by the foregoing table, to
be found under Prop. XX, the descent in the latitude of <i>Paris</i>
will be a little greater by an excess of about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/226.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_226.svg_3"> parts
of a line. Therefore, by this computation, heavy bodies in the latitude
of <i>Paris</i> falling <i>in vacuo</i> will describe 15 <i>Paris</i>
feet, 1 inch, <img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{25}{33}" src="images/1089.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1089.svg"> lines, very nearly, in one second of
time. And if the gravity be diminished by taking away a quantity equal
to the centrifugal force arising in that latitude from the earth's
diurnal motion, heavy bodies falling there will describe in one second
of time 15 feet, 1 inch, and <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/208.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_208.svg_5"> line. And with this
velocity heavy bodies do really fall in the latitude of <i>Paris</i>,
as we have shewn above in Prop. IV and XIX.</p>

meridian, the lengths of isochronous pendulums in different parallels,
the laws of the motions of the sea, and the moon's parallax, with
the apparent diameters of the sun and moon, should be more exactly

<p class="nindc"><i>To find the figure of the moon's body.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If the moon's body were fluid like our sea, the force of the earth to
raise that fluid in the nearest and remotest parts would be to the
force of the moon by which our sea is raised in the places under and
opposite to the moon as the accelerative gravity of the moon towards
the earth to the accelerative gravity of the earth towards the moon,
and the diameter of the moon to the diameter of the earth conjunctly;
that is, as 39,788 to 1, and 100 to 365 conjunctly, or as 1081 to
100. Wherefore, since our sea, by the force of the moon, is raised to
<img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{3}{5}" src="images/1012.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_1012.svg_1"> feet, the lunar fluid would be raised by the force
of the earth to 93 feet; and upon this account the figure of the moon
would be a spheroid, whose greatest diameter produced would pass
through the centre of the earth, and exceed the diameters perpendicular
thereto by 186 feet. Such a figure, therefore, the moon affects, and

<p>COR. Hence it is that the same face of the moon always respects
the earth; nor can the body of the moon possibly rest in any other
position, but would return always by a libratory motion to this
situation; but those librations, however, must be exceedingly slow,
because of the weakness of the forces which excite them; so that the
face of the moon, which should be always obverted to the earth, may,
for the reason assigned in Prop. XVII. be turned towards the other
focus of the moon's orbit, without being immediately drawn back, and
converted again towards the earth.</p>

particle F recedes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</span> from the plane QR will (by supposition) be as that
perpendicular FG; and this force multiplied by the distance CG will
represent the power of the particle F to turn the earth round its
centre. And, therefore, the power of a particle in the place F will be
to the power of a particle in the place A as FG × GC to AH × HC; that
is, as FC<sup>2</sup> to AC<sup>2</sup>: and therefore the whole power of all the particles
F, in their proper places F, will be to the power of the like number
of particles in the place A as the sum of all the FC<sup>2</sup> to the sum of
all the AC<sup>2</sup>, that is (by what we have demonstrated before) as 1 to 2.

<p>And because the action of those particles is exerted in the direction
of lines perpendicularly receding from the plane QR, and that equally
from each side of this plane, they will wheel about the circumference
of the circle of the equator, together with the adherent body of the
earth, round an axis which lies as well in the plane QR as in that of
the equator.</p>

<p>For let IK be any lesser circle parallel to the equator AE, and let
L<i>l</i> be any two equal particles in this circle, situated without

angles with a radius drawn to the sun, we let fall the perpendiculars
LM, <i>lm</i>, the total forces by which these particles recede
from the plane QR will be proportional to the perpendiculars LM,

N<i>n</i> parallel to the plane QR, and meeting the perpendiculars

the difference of the two, is the force of both taken together to turn the

together, to wheel the earth about, is to the force of two particles,
equal to the former and situated in the place A, to turn in like manner
the earth round, as LX<sup>2</sup> - CX<sup>2</sup> to AC<sup>2</sup>. But if the circumference IK

Wherefore the united forces of all the particles in the circumference
of the circle IK are to the joint forces of as many particles in the
place A as IX<sup>2</sup> - 2CX<sup>2</sup> to 2AC<sup>2</sup>; and therefore (by Lem. 1) to the
united forces of as many particles in the circumference of the circle

<p>Now if P<i>p</i>, the diameter of the sphere, is conceived to be
divided into an infinite number of equal parts, upon which a like
number of circles IK are supposed to insist, the matter in the
circumference of every circle IK will be as IX<sup>2</sup>; and therefore the
force of that matter to turn the earth about will be as IX<sup>2</sup> into
IX<sup>2</sup> - 2CX<sup>2</sup>; and the force of the same matter, if it was situated in
the circumference of the circle AE, would be as IX<sup>2</sup> into AC<sup>2</sup>. And
therefore the force of all the particles of the whole matter situated
without the sphere in the circumferences of all the circles is to the
force of the like number of particles situated in the circumference
of the greatest circle AE as all the IX<sup>2</sup> into IX<sup>2</sup> - 2CX<sup>2</sup> to as

</div>

<p>The middle horary motion of the moon's nodes in a circular orbit,
when the nodes are in the quadratures, was 16'' 35''' 16<sup>iv</sup>. 36<sup>v</sup>.;
the half of which, 8'' 17''' 38<sup>iv</sup>. 18<sup>v</sup>. (for the reasons above
explained) is the mean horary motion of the nodes in such an orbit,
which motion in a whole sidereal year becomes 20° 11' 46''. Because,
therefore, the nodes of the moon in such an orbit would be yearly
transferred 20° 11' 46'' <i>in antecedentia</i>; and, if there were
more moons, the motion of the nodes of every one (by Cor. 16, Prop.
LXVI, Book I) would be as its periodic time; if upon the surface of the
earth a moon was revolved in the time of a sidereal day, the annual
motion of the nodes of this moon would be to 20° 11' 46'' as 23<sup>h</sup>. 56',
the sidereal day, to 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43', the periodic time of our moon,
that is, as 1436 to 39343. And the same thing would happen to the nodes
of a ring of moons encompassing the earth, whether these moons did not
mutually touch each the other, or whether they were molten, and formed
into a continued ring, or whether that ring should become rigid and
inflexible.</p>

<p>Let us, then, suppose that this ring is in quantity of matter equal to
the whole exterior earth P<i>ap</i>AP<i>ep</i>E, which lies without
the sphere P<i>ape</i> (see fig. Lem. II); and because this sphere is
to that exterior earth as <i>a</i>C<sup>2</sup> to AC<sup>2</sup> - <i>a</i>C<sup>2</sup>, that is
(seeing PC or <i>a</i>C the least semi-diameter of the earth is to AC
the greatest semi-diameter of the same as 229 to 230), as 52441 to
459; if this ring encompassed the earth round the equator, and both
together were revolved about the diameter of the ring, the motion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</span>
the ring (by Lem. III) would be to the motion of the inner sphere as
459 to 52441 and 1000000 to 925275 conjunctly, that is, as 4590 to
485223; and therefore the motion of the ring would be to the sum of the
motions of both ring and sphere as 4590 to 489813. Wherefore if the
ring adheres to the sphere, and communicates its motion to the sphere,
by which its nodes or equinoctial points recede, the motion remaining
in the ring will be to its former motion as 4590 to 489813; upon which
account the motion of the equinoctial points will be diminished in the
same proportion. Wherefore the annual motion of the equinoctial points
of the body, composed of both ring and sphere, will be to the motion
20° 11' 46'' as 1436 to 39343 and 4590 to 489813 conjunctly, that is,
as 100 to 292369. But the forces by which the nodes of a number of
moons (as we explained above), and therefore by which the equinoctial
points of the ring recede (that is, the forces 3IT, in fig. Prop.
XXX), are in the several particles as the distances of those particles
from the plane QR; and by these forces the particles recede from that
plane: and therefore (by Lem. II) if the matter of the ring was spread
all over the surface of the sphere, after the fashion of the figure
P<i>ap</i>AP<i>ep</i>E, in order to make up that exterior part of the
earth, the total force or power of all the particles to wheel about
the earth round any diameter of the equator, and therefore to move the
equinoctial points, would become less than before in the proportion of
2 to 5. Wherefore the annual regress of the equinoxes now would be to
20° 11' 46'' as 10 to 73092; that is, would be 9'' 56''' 50<sup>iv</sup>.</p>

<p>But because the plane of the equator is inclined to that of the
ecliptic, this motion is to be diminished in the proportion of the sine
91706 (which is the co-sine of <img alt="" data-tex="23\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1097.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1097.svg_1"> deg.) to the radius
100000; and the remaining motion will now be 9'' 7''' 20<sup>iv</sup>. which is
the annual precession of the equinoxes arising from the force of the
sun.</p>

<p>But the force of the moon to move the sea was to the force of the sun
nearly as 4,4815 to 1; and the force of the moon to move the equinoxes
is to that of the sun in the same proportion. Whence the annual
precession of the equinoxes proceeding from the force of the moon comes
out 40'' 52''' 52<sup>iv</sup>. and the total annual precession arising from
the united forces of both will be 50'' 00''' 12<sup>iv</sup>. the quantity
of which motion agrees with the phænomena; for the precession of the
equinoxes, by astronomical observations, is about 50'' yearly.</p>

<p>If the height of the earth at the equator exceeds its height at the
poles by more than <img alt="" data-tex="17\tfrac{1}{6}" src="images/1098.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1098.svg"> miles, the matter thereof will be
more rare near the surface than at the centre; and the precession of
the equinoxes will be augmented by the excess of height, and diminished
by the greater rarity.</p>

<p>And now we have described the system of the sun, the earth, moon, and
planets, it remains that we add something about the comets.</p>

<p>As the comets were placed by astronomers above the moon, because they
were found to have no diurnal parallax, so their annual parallax is a
convincing proof of their descending into the regions of the planets;
for all the comets which move in a direct course according to the
order of the signs, about the end of their appearance become more
than ordinarily slow or retrograde, if the earth is between them and
the sun; and more than ordinarily swift, if the earth is approaching
to a heliocentric opposition with them; whereas, on the other hand,
those which move against the order of the signs, towards the end of
their appearance appear swifter than they ought to be, if the earth
is between them and the sun; and slower, and perhaps retrograde, if
the earth is in the other side of its orbit. And these appearances
proceed chiefly from the diverse situations which the earth acquires in
the course of its motion, after the same manner as it happens to the
planets, which appear sometimes retrograde, sometimes more slowly, and
sometimes more swiftly, progressive, according as the motion of the
earth falls in with that of the planet, or is directed the contrary
way. If the earth move the same way with the comet, but, by an angular
motion about the sun, so much swifter that right lines drawn from the
earth to the comet converge towards the parts beyond the comet, the
comet seen from the earth, because of its slower motion, will appear
retrograde; and even if the earth is slower than the comet, the motion
of the earth being subducted, the motion of the comet will at least
appear retarded; but if the earth tends the contrary way to that of the
comet, the motion of the comet will from thence appear accelerated;
and from this apparent acceleration, or retardation, or regressive
motion, the distance of the comet may be inferred in this manner.

is justly to be esteemed the parallax of the comet; neglecting, to wit,
some little increment or decrement that may arise from the unequal

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</span></p>

<p>The same thing may be deduced from the incurvation of the way of the
comets; for these bodies move almost in great circles, while their
velocity is great; but about the end of their course, when that part of
their apparent motion which arises from the parallax bears a greater
proportion to their whole apparent motion, they commonly deviate from
those circles, and when the earth goes to one side, they deviate to the
other; and this deflexion, because of its corresponding with the motion
of the earth, must arise chiefly from the parallax; and the quantity
thereof is so considerable, as, by my computation, to place the
disappearing comets a good deal lower than Jupiter. Whence it follows
that when they approach nearer to us in their perigees and perihelions
they often descend below the orbs of Mars and the inferior planets.</p>

<p>The near approach of the comets is farther confirmed from the light
of their heads; for the light of a celestial body, illuminated by the
sun, and receding to remote parts, is diminished in the quadruplicate
proportion of the distance; to wit, in one duplicate proportion, on
account of the increase of the distance from the sun, and in another
duplicate proportion, on account of the decrease of the apparent
diameter. Wherefore if both the quantity of light and the apparent
diameter of a comet are given, its distance will be also given, by
taking the distance of the comet to the distance of a planet in the
direct proportion of their diameters and the reciprocal subduplicate
proportion of their lights. Thus, in the comet of the year 1682, Mr.
<i>Flamsted</i> observed with a telescope of 16 feet, and measured with
a micrometer, the least diameter of its head, 2' 00; but the nucleus
or star in the middle of the head scarcely amounted to the tenth part
of this measure; and therefore its diameter was only 11'' or 12''; but
in the light and splendor of its head it surpassed that of the comet
in the year 1680, and might be compared with the stars of the first or
second magnitude. Let us suppose that Saturn with its ring was about
four times more lucid; and because the light of the ring was almost
equal to the light of the globe within, and the apparent diameter of
the globe is about 21'', and therefore the united light of both globe
and ring would be equal to the light of a globe whose diameter is 30'',
it follows that the distance of the comet was to the distance of Saturn
as 1 to <img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{4}" src="images/1110.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.213ex; width: 3.061ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_1110.svg"> inversely, and 12'' to 30'' directly; that is,
as 24 to 30, or 4 to 5. Again; the comet in the month of <i>April</i>
1665, as <i>Hevelius</i> informs us, excelled almost all the fixed
stars in splendor, and even Saturn itself, as being of a much more
vivid colour; for this comet was more lucid than that other which had
appeared about the end of the preceding year, and had been compared to
the stars of the first magnitude. The diameter of its head was about
6'; but the nucleus, compared with the planets by means of a telescope,
was plainly less than Jupiter; and sometimes judged less, sometimes
judged equal, to the globe of Saturn within the ring. Since, then, the
diameters of the heads of the comets seldom exceed 8' or 12', and the
diameter of the nucleus or central star is but about a tenth or perhaps
fifteenth part of the diameter of the head, it appears that these stars
are generally of about the same apparent magnitude with the planets.
But in regard that their light may be often compared with the light of
Saturn, yea, and sometimes exceeds it, it is evident that all comets in
their perihelions must either be placed below or not far above Saturn;
and they are much mistaken who remove them almost as far as the fixed
stars; for if it was so, the comets could receive no more light from
our sun than our planets do from the fixed stars.</p>

<p>So far we have gone, without considering the obscuration which comets
suffer from that plenty of thick smoke which encompasseth their heads,
and through which the heads always shew dull, as through a cloud; for
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</span> how much the more a body is obscured by this smoke, by so much
the more near it must be allowed to come to the sun, that it may vie
with the planets in the quantity of light which it reflects. Whence
it is probable that the comets descend far below the orb of Saturn,
as we proved before from their parallax. But, above all, the thing is
evinced from their tails, which must be owing either to the sun's light
reflected by a smoke arising from them, and dispersing itself through
the æther, or to the light of their own heads. In the former case, we
must shorten the distance of the comets, lest we be obliged to allow
that the smoke arising from their heads is propagated through such a
vast extent of space, and with such a velocity and expansion as will
seem altogether incredible; in the latter case, the whole light of both
head and tail is to be ascribed to the central nucleus. But, then,
if we suppose all this light to be united and condensed within the
disk of the nucleus, certainly the nucleus will by far exceed Jupiter
itself in splendor, especially when it emits a very large and lucid
tail. If, therefore, under a less apparent diameter, it reflects more
light, it must be much more illuminated by the sun, and therefore much
nearer to it; and the same argument will bring down the heads of comets
sometimes within the orb of Venus, viz., when, being hid under the
sun's rays, they emit such huge and splendid tails, like beams of fire,
as sometimes they do; for if all that light was supposed to be gathered
together into one star, it would sometimes exceed not one Venus only,
but a great many such united into one.</p>

<p>Lastly; the same thing is inferred from the light of the heads, which
increases in the recess of the comets from the earth towards the sun,
and decreases in their return from the sun towards the earth; for so
the comet of the year 1665 (by the observations of <i>Hevelius</i>),
from the time that it was first seen, was always losing of its
apparent motion, and therefore had already passed its perigee; but
yet the splendor of its head was daily increasing, till, being hid
under the sun's rays, the comet ceased to appear. The comet of the
year 1683 (by the observations of the same <i>Hevelius</i>), about
the end of <i>July</i>, when it first appeared, moved at a very slow
rate, advancing only about 40 or 45 minutes in its orb in a day's
time; but from that time its diurnal motion was continually upon the
increase, till <i>September</i> 4, when it arose to about 5 degrees;
and therefore, in all this interval of time, the comet was approaching
to the earth. Which is likewise proved from the diameter of its head,
measured with a micrometer; for, <i>August</i> 6, <i>Hevelius</i> found
it only 6' 05'', including the <i>coma</i>, which, <i>September</i> 2
he observed to be 9' 07'', and therefore its head appeared far less
about the beginning than towards the end of the motion; though about
the beginning, because nearer to the sun, it appeared far more lucid
than towards the end, as the same <i>Hevelius</i> declares. Wherefore
in all this interval of time, on account of its recess from the sun,
it decreased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</span> in splendor, notwithstanding its access towards the
earth. The comet of the year 1618, about the middle of <i>December</i>,
and that of the year 1680, about the end of the same month, did both
move with their greatest velocity, and were therefore then in their
perigees; but the greatest splendor of their heads was seen two weeks
before, when they had just got clear of the sun's rays; and the
greatest splendor of their tails a little more early, when yet nearer
to the sun. The head of the former comet (according to the observations
of <i>Cysatus</i>), <i>December</i> 1, appeared greater than the stars
of the first magnitude; and, <i>December</i> 16 (then in the perigee),
it was but little diminished in magnitude, but in the splendor and
brightness of its light a great deal. <i>January</i> 7, <i>Kepler</i>,
being uncertain about the head, left off observing. <i>December</i>
12, the head of the latter comet was seen and observed by Mr.
<i>Flamsted</i>, when but 9 degrees distant from the sun; which is
scarcely to be done in a star of the third magnitude. <i>December</i>
15 and 17, it appeared as a star of the third magnitude, its lustre
being diminished by the brightness of the clouds near the setting sun.
<i>December</i> 26, when it moved with the greatest velocity, being
almost in its perigee, it was less than the mouth of <i>Pegasus</i>, a
star of the third magnitude. <i>January</i> 3, it appeared as a star
of the fourth. <i>January</i> 9, as one of the fifth. <i>January</i>
13, it was hid by the splendor of the moon, then in her increase.
<i>January</i> 25, it was scarcely equal to the stars of the seventh
magnitude. If we compare equal intervals of time on one side and on the
other from the perigee, we shall find that the head of the comet, which
at both intervals of time was far, but yet equally, removed from the
earth, and should have therefore shone with equal splendor, appeared
brightest on the side of the perigee towards the sun, and disappeared
on the other. Therefore, from the great difference of light in the one
situation and in the other, we conclude the great vicinity of the sun
and comet in the former; for the light of comets uses to be regular,
and to appear greatest when the heads move fastest, and are therefore
in their perigees; excepting in so far as it is increased by their
nearness to the sun.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Therefore the comets shine by the sun's light, which they
reflect.</p>

<p>COR. 2. From what has been said, we may likewise understand why comets
are so frequently seen in that hemisphere in which the sun is, and so
seldom in the other. If they were visible in the regions far above
Saturn, they would appear more frequently in the parts opposite to the
sun; for such as were in those parts would be nearer to the earth,
whereas the presence of the sun must obscure and hide those that
appear in the hemisphere in which he is. Yet, looking over the history
of comets, I find that four or five times more have been seen in the
hemisphere towards the sun than in the opposite hemisphere; besides,
without doubt, not a few, which have been hid by the light of the
sun: for comets descending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</span> into our parts neither emit tails, nor
are so well illuminated by the sun, as to discover themselves to our
naked eyes, until they are come nearer to us than Jupiter. But the far
greater part of that spherical space, which is described about the sun
with so small an interval, lies on that side of the earth which regards
the sun; and the comets in that greater part are commonly more strongly
illuminated, as being for the most part nearer to the sun.</p>

<p>COR. 3. Hence also it is evident that the celestial spaces are void
of resistance; for though the comets are carried in oblique paths,
and sometimes contrary to the course of the planets, yet they move
every way with the greatest freedom, and preserve their motions for an
exceeding long time, even where contrary to the course of the planets.
I am out in my judgment if they are not a sort of planets revolving in
orbits returning into themselves with a perpetual motion; for, as to
what some writers contend, that they are no other than meteors, led
into this opinion by the perpetual changes that happen to their heads,
it seems to have no foundation; for the heads of comets are encompassed
with huge atmospheres, and the lowermost parts of these atmospheres
must be the densest; and therefore it is in the clouds only, not in the
bodies of the comets themselves, that these changes are seen. Thus the
earth, if it was viewed from the planets, would, without all doubt,
shine by the light of its clouds, and the solid body would scarcely
appear through the surrounding clouds. Thus also the belts of Jupiter
are formed in the clouds of that planet, for they change their position
one to another, and the solid body of Jupiter is hardly to be seen
through them; and much more must the bodies of comets be hid under
their atmospheres, which are both deeper and thicker.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XL. THEOREM XX.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>That the comets move in some of the conic sections, having their
foci in the centre of the sun; and by radii drawn to the sun describe
areas proportional to the times.</i></p>
</div>

<p>This proposition appears from Cor. 1, Prop. XIII, Book I, compared with
Prop. VIII, XII, and XIII, Book III.</p>

<p>COR. 1. Hence if comets are revolved in orbits returning into
themselves, those orbits will be ellipses; and their periodic times be
to the periodic times of the planets in the sesquiplicate proportion
of their principal axes. And therefore the comets, which for the
most part of their course are higher than the planets, and upon that
account describe orbits with greater axes, will require a longer time
to finish their revolutions. Thus if the axis of a comet's orbit was
four times greater than the axis of the orbit of Saturn, the time of
the revolution of the comet would be to the time of the revolution of
Saturn, that is, to 30 years, as <img alt="" data-tex="4\sqrt{4}" src="images/1111.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.213ex; width: 4.192ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_1111.svg"> (or 8) to 1, and would
therefore be 240 years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</span></p>

<p>COR. 2. But their orbits will be so near to parabolas, that parabolas
may be used for them without sensible error.</p>

<p>COR. 3. And, therefore, by Cor. 7, Prop. XVI, Book I, the velocity of
every comet will always be to the velocity of any planet, supposed to
be revolved at the same distance in a circle about the sun, nearly
in the subduplicate proportion of double the distance of the planet
from the centre of the sun to the distance of the comet from the
sun's centre, very nearly. Let us suppose the radius of the <i>orbis
magnus</i>, or the greatest semi-diameter of the ellipsis which the
earth describes, to consist of 100000000 parts; and then the earth
by its mean diurnal motion will describe 1720212 of those parts, and
<img alt="" data-tex="71675\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1112.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 7.451ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1112.svg"> by its horary motion. And therefore the comet, at
the same mean distance of the earth from the sun, with a velocity which
is to the velocity of the earth as <img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt{2}" src="images/1113.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.225ex; width: 3.061ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_1113.svg"> to 1, would by its
diurnal motion describe 2432747 parts, and <img alt="" data-tex="101364\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1114.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 8.583ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1114.svg"> parts
by its horary motion. But at greater or less distances both the diurnal
and horary motion will be to this diurnal and horary motion in the
reciprocal subduplicate proportion of the distances, and is therefore
given.</p>

<p>COR. 4. Wherefore if the <i>latus rectum</i> of the parabola is
quadruple of the radius of the <i>orbis magnus</i>, and the square
of that radius is supposed to consist of 100000000 parts, the area
which the comet will daily describe by a radius drawn to the sun
will be <img alt="" data-tex="1216373\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1115.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 9.714ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1115.svg"> parts, and the horary area will be
<img alt="" data-tex="50682\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/1116.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 7.451ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1116.svg"> parts. But, if the <i>latus rectum</i> is greater
or less in any proportion, the diurnal and horary area will be less or
greater in the subduplicate of the same proportion reciprocally.</p>

the difference of the times may be to the sum of the times as the sum
of the times to about 600 days; or that the point E may fall upon M
nearly, and may err therefrom rather towards I than towards A. If such
direct observations are not at hand, a new place of the comet must be
found, by Lem. VI.</p>

be determined. Lastly, if (by Prop. XIX., Book I) to the focus S a
parabola is described passing through those two places, this parabola
will be the orbit of the comet. Q.E.I.</p>

<p>The demonstration of this construction follows from the preceding
Lemmas, because the right line AC is cut in E in the proportion of the
times, by Lem. VII, as it ought to be, by Lem. VIII.; and BE, by Lem.
XI., is a portion of the right line BS or <img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm B \xi" src="images/1187.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 2.593ex; height: 2.057ex;" id="img_images_1187.svg"> in the
plane of the ecliptic, intercepted between the arc ABC and the chord
AEC; and MP (by Cor. Lem. X.) is the length of the chord of that arc,
which the comet should describe in its proper orbit between the first
and third observation, and therefore is equal to MN, providing B is a
true place of the comet in the plane of the ecliptic.</p>

<p>But it will be convenient to assume the points B, <i>b</i>, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\beta" src="images/1052.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" id="img_images_1052.svg_2">,</span>
not at random, but nearly true. If the angle AQ<i>t</i>, at which the
projection of the orbit in the plane of the ecliptic cuts the right
line <i>t</i>B, is rudely known, at that angle with B<i>t</i> draw the
obscure line AC, which may be to <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{4}{3}\mathrm T \tau" src="images/1188.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.599ex; height: 2.79ex;" id="img_images_1188.svg"> in the
subduplicate proportion of SQ to S<i>t</i>; and, drawing the right
line SEB so as its part EB may be equal to the length V<i>t</i>, the
point B will be determined, which we are to use for the first time.
Then, cancelling the right line AC, and drawing anew AC according to
the preceding construction, and, moreover, finding the length MP, in
<i>t</i>B take the point <i>b</i>, by this rule, that, if TA and <img alt="" data-tex="\tau \mathrm C" src="images/1189.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 2.803ex; height: 1.643ex;" id="img_images_1189.svg"> intersect each other in Y, the distance Y<i>b</i> may be
to the distance YB in a proportion compounded of the proportion of MP
to MN, and the subduplicate proportion of SB to S<i>b</i>. And by the

repeat the operation the third time; but if this method is followed,
two operations generally will be sufficient; for if the distance
B<i>b</i> happens to be very small, after the points F, <i>f</i>, and
G, <i>g</i>, are found, draw the right lines F<i>f</i> and G<i>g</i>,
and they will cut TA and <img alt="" data-tex="\tau \mathrm C" src="images/1167.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.048ex; width: 2.803ex; height: 1.643ex;" id="img_images_1167.svg_4"> in the points required, X

the horizon, was scarcely discernible, and therefore its place could
not be determined with that certainty as in the foregoing observations.</p>

<p>From these observations, by constructions of figures and calculations,
I deduced the longitudes and latitudes of the comet; and Mr.
<i>Pound</i>, by correcting the places of the fixed stars, hath
determined more correctly the places of the comet, which correct
places are set down above. Though my micrometer was none of the
best, yet the errors in longitude and latitude (as derived from my
observations) scarcely exceed one minute. The comet (according to my
observations), about the end of its motion, began to decline sensibly
towards the north, from the parallel which it described about the end
of <i>February</i>.</p>

<p>Now, in order to determine the orbit of the comet out of the
observations above described, I selected those three which
<i>Flamsted</i> made, <i>Dec. 21</i>, <i>Jan. 5</i>, and <i>Jan.
25</i>; from which I found S<i>t</i> of 9842,1 parts, and V<i>t</i>

the square of the semi-diameter of the <i>orbis magnus</i> 100000000;
that the comet in this orbit moved directly according to the order of
the signs, and on <i>Dec.</i> 8<sup>d</sup>. 00<sup>h</sup>. 04' P. M. was in the vertex or

and the chords of angles, taken from the table of natural sines, in
a pretty large figure, in which, to wit, the radius of the <i>orbis

arithmetical operations, and partly by scale and compass, to the times
of some of the observations, as may be seen in the following table:—</p>

<p>This comet also appeared in the <i>November</i> before, and at
<i>Coburg</i>, in <i>Saxony</i>, was observed by Mr. <i>Gottfried
Kirch</i>, on the 4th of that month, on the 6th and 11th O. S.; from
its positions to the nearest fixed stars observed with sufficient
accuracy, sometimes with a two feet, and sometimes with a ten feet
telescope; from the difference of longitudes of <i>Coburg</i> and
<i>London</i>; 11°; and from the places of the fixed stars observed by
Mr. <i>Pound</i>, Dr. <i>Halley</i> has determined the places of the
comet as follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</span></p>

<p><i>Nov. 3</i>, 17<sup>h</sup>. 2', apparent time at <i>London</i>, the comet was
in ♌ 29 deg. 51', with 1 deg. 17' 45'' latitude north.</p>

<p><i>November 5</i>, 15<sup>h</sup>. 58' the comet was in ♍ 3° 23', with 1° 6' lat.
north.</p>

<p><i>November 10</i>, 16<sup>h</sup>. 31', the comet was equally distant from
two stars in ♌, which are <img alt="" data-tex="\sigma" src="images/1253.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" id="img_images_1253.svg"> and <img alt="" data-tex="\tau" src="images/1166.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" id="img_images_1166.svg_1"> in <i>Bayer</i>;
but it had not quite touched the right line that joins them, but was
very little distant from it. In <i>Flamsted's</i> catalogue this star
<img alt="" data-tex="\sigma" src="images/1253.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.292ex; height: 1ex;" id="img_images_1253.svg_1"> was then in ♍︎ 14° 15', with 1 deg. 41' lat. north nearly,
and <img alt="" data-tex="\tau" src="images/1166.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.029ex; width: 1.17ex; height: 1.005ex;" id="img_images_1166.svg_2"> in ♍ 17° <img alt="" data-tex="3\tfrac{1}{2}'" src="images/1254.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.554ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1254.svg"> with 0 deg. 34' lat. south; and
the middle point between those stars was ♍ 15° <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="39\tfrac{1}{4}'" src="images/1255.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.686ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1255.svg">,</span>

from that right line be about 10' or 12'; and the difference of the
longitude of the comet and that middle point will be 7'; and the
difference of the latitude nearly <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="7\tfrac{1}{2}'" src="images/1257.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.554ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1257.svg">;</span> and thence it
follows that the comet was in ♍ 15° 32', with about 26' lat. north.</p>

<p>The first observation from the position of the comet with respect to
certain small fixed stars had all the exactness that could be desired;
the second also was accurate enough. In the third observation, which
was the least accurate, there might be an error of 6 or 7 minutes, but
hardly greater. The longitude of the comet, as found in the first and
most accurate observation, being computed in the aforesaid parabolic
orbit, comes out ♌ 29° 30' 22'', its latitude north 1° 25' 7'', and its
distance from the sun 115546.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</span></p>

<p>Moreover, Dr. <i>Halley</i>, observing that a remarkable comet had
appeared four times at equal intervals of 575 years (that is, in the
month of <i>September</i> after <i>Julius Cæsar</i> was killed; <i>An.
Chr.</i> 531, in the consulate of <i>Lampadius</i> and <i>Orestes</i>;
<i>An. Chr.</i> 1106, in the month of <i>February</i>; and at the end
of the year 1680; and that with a long and remarkable tail, except when
it was seen after <i>Cæsar's</i> death, at which time, by reason of the
inconvenient situation of the earth, the tail was not so conspicuous),
set himself to find out an elliptic orbit whose greater axis should be
1382957 parts, the mean distance of the earth from the sun containing
10000 such; in which orbit a comet might revolve in 575 years; and,
placing the ascending node in ♋ 2° 2', the inclination of the plane of
the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic in an angle of 61° 6' 48'', the
perihelion of the comet in this plane in ♐ 22° 44' 25'', the equal time
of the perihelion <i>December</i> 7<sup>d</sup>. 23<sup>h</sup>. 9', the distance of the
perihelion from the ascending node in the plane of the ecliptic 9° 17'
35'', and its conjugate axis 18481,2, he computed the motions of the
comet in this elliptic orbit. The places of the comet, as deduced from
the observations, and as arising from computation made in this orbit,
may be seen in the following table.</p>

<p>The observations of this comet from the beginning to the end agree as
perfectly with the motion of the comet in the orbit just now described
as the motions of the planets do with the theories from whence they are
calculated; and by this agreement plainly evince that it was one and
the same comet that appeared all that time, and also that the orbit of
that comet is here rightly defined.</p>

<p>In the foregoing table we have omitted the observations of <i>Nov.
16</i>, 18, 20, and 23, as not sufficiently accurate, for at those
times several persons had observed the comet. <i>Nov. 17</i>, O.
S. <i>Ponthæus</i> and his companions, at 6<sup>h</sup>. in the morning at
<i>Rome</i> (that is, 5<sup>h</sup>. 10' at <i>London</i>), by threads directed
to the fixed stars, observed the comet in ♎ 8° 30', with latitude
0° 40' south. Their observations may be seen in a treatise which
<i>Ponthæus</i> published concerning this comet. <i>Cellius</i>,
who was present, and communicated his observations in a letter to
<i>Cassini</i>, saw the comet at the same hour in ♎ 8° 30', with
latitude 0° 30' south. It was likewise seen by <i>Galletius</i> at
the same hour at <i>Avignon</i> (that is, at 5<sup>h</sup>. 42' morning at
<i>London</i>) in ♎ 8° without latitude. But by the theory the comet
was at that time in ♎ 8° 16' 45'', and its latitude was 0° 53' 7''
south.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 18</i>, at 6<sup>h</sup>. 30' in the morning at <i>Rome</i> (that is,
at 5<sup>h</sup>. 40' at <i>London</i>), <i>Ponthæus</i> observed the comet in
♎ 13° 30', with latitude 1° 20'<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</span> south; and <i>Cellius</i> in ♎ 13°
30', with latitude 1° 00' south. But at 5<sup>h</sup>. 30' in the morning at
<i>Avignon</i>, <i>Galletius</i> saw it in ♎ 13° 00' with latitude 1°
00' south. In the University of <i>La Fleche</i>, in <i>France</i>, at
5<sup>h</sup>. in the morning (that is, at 5<sup>h</sup>. 9' at <i>London</i>), it was seen
by <i>P. Ango</i>, in the middle between two small stars, one of which
is the middle of the three which lie in a right line in the southern
hand of Virgo, <i>Bayers</i> <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\psi" src="images/1258.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.464ex; width: 1.473ex; height: 2.034ex;" id="img_images_1258.svg">;</span> and the other is the outmost of
the wing, <i>Bayer's</i> <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\theta" src="images/1259.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.061ex; height: 1.618ex;" id="img_images_1259.svg">.</span> Whence the comet was then in ♎ 12°
46' with latitude 50' south. And I was informed by Dr. <i>Halley</i>,
that on the same day at <i>Boston</i> in <i>New England</i>, in the
latitude of <img alt="" data-tex="42\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1260.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1260.svg"> deg. at 5<sup>h</sup>. in the morning (that is, at
9<sup>h</sup>. 44' in the morning at <i>London</i>), the comet was seen near ♎
14°, with latitude 1° 30' south.</p>

<p><i>Nov</i>. 19, at <img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{1}{2}^{h}." src="images/1261.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1261.svg"> at <i>Cambridge</i>, the comet
(by the observation of a young man) was distant from <i>Spica</i> ♍
about 2° towards the north west. Now the spike was at that time in ♎
19° 23' 47'', with latitude 2° 1' 59'' south. The same day, at 5<sup>h</sup>.
in the morning, at <i>Boston</i> in <i>New England</i>, the comet was
distant from <i>Spica</i> ♍ 1°, with the difference of 40' in latitude.
The same day, in the island of <i>Jamaica</i>, it was about 1° distant
from <i>Spica</i> ♍. The same day, Mr. <i>Arthur Storer</i>, at the
river <i>Patuxent</i>, near <i>Hunting Creek</i>, in <i>Maryland</i>,
in the confines of <i>Virginia</i>, in lat. <img alt="" data-tex="38\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1262.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1262.svg"><sup>°</sup>, at
5 in the morning (that is, at 10<sup>h</sup>. at <i>London</i>), saw the comet

observations compared, I conclude, that at 9<sup>h</sup>. 44' at <i>London</i>,
the comet was in ♎ 18° 50', with about 1° 25' latitude south. Now by
the theory the comet was at that time in ♎ 18° 52' 15'', with 1° 26'
54'' lat. south.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 20</i>, <i>Montenari</i>, professor of astronomy at
<i>Padua</i>, at 6<sup>h</sup>. in the morning at <i>Venice</i> (that is, 5<sup>h</sup>.
10' at <i>London</i>), saw the comet in ♎ 23°, with latitude 1° 30'
south. The same day, at <i>Boston</i>, it was distant from <i>Spica</i>
♍ by about 4° of longitude east, and therefore was in ♎ 23° 24' nearly.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 21</i>, <i>Ponthæus</i> and his companions, at
<img alt="" data-tex="7\tfrac{1}{4}^{h}." src="images/1263.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1263.svg"> in the morning, observed the comet in ♎ 27° 50',
with latitude 1° 16' south; <i>Cellius</i>, in ♎ 28°; <i>P. Ango</i>
at 5<sup>h</sup>. in the morning, in ♎ 27° 45'; <i>Montenari</i> in ♎ 27° 51'.
The same day, in the island of <i>Jamaica</i>, it was seen near the
beginning of ♏, and of about the same latitude with <i>Spica</i> ♍,
that is, 2° 2'. The same day, at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning, at <i>Ballasore</i>, in
the <i>East Indies</i> (that is, at 11<sup>h</sup>. 20' of the night preceding at
<i>London</i>), the distance of the comet from <i>Spica</i> ♍ was taken
7° 35' to the east. It was in a right line between the spike and the
balance, and therefore was then in ♎ 26° 58', with about 1° 11' lat.
south; and after 5<sup>h</sup>. 40' (that is, at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning at <i>London</i>),
it was in ♎ 28° 12', with 1° 16' lat. south. Now by the theory the
comet was then in ♎ 28° 10' 36'', with 1° 53' 35'' lat. south.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 22</i>, the comet was seen by <i>Montenari</i> in ♏ 2° 33'; but
at <i>Boston</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</span> in <i>New England</i>, it was found in about ♏ 3°,
and with almost the same latitude as before, that is, 1° 30'. The same
day, at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning at <i>Ballasore</i>, the comet was observed in ♏
1° 50'; and therefore at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning at <i>London</i>, the comet was
in ♏ 3° 5' nearly. The same day, at <img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{2}^{h}." src="images/1264.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1264.svg"> in the morning
at <i>London</i>, Dr. <i>Hook</i> observed it in about ♏ 3° 30', and
that in the right line which passeth through <i>Spica</i> ♍ and <i>Cor
Leonis</i>; not, indeed, exactly, but deviating a little from that
line towards the north. <i>Montenari</i> likewise observed, that this
day, and some days after, a right line drawn from the comet through
<i>Spica</i> passed by the south side of <i>Cor Leonis</i> at a very
small distance therefrom. The right line through <i>Cor Leonis</i> and
<i>Spica</i> ♍ did cut the ecliptic in ♍ 3° 46' at an angle of 2° 51';
and if the comet had been in this line and in ♏ 3°, its latitude would
have been 2° 26'; but since <i>Hook</i> and <i>Montenari</i> agree
that the comet was at some small distance from this line towards the
north, its latitude must have been something less. On the 20th, by the
observation of <i>Montenari</i>, its latitude was almost the same with
that of <i>Spica</i> ♍, that is, about 1° 30'. But by the agreement
of <i>Hook</i>, <i>Montenari</i>, and <i>Ango</i>, the latitude was
continually increasing, and therefore must now, on the 22d, be sensibly
greater than 1° 30'; and, taking a mean between the extreme limits
but now stated, 2° 26' and 1° 30', the latitude will be about 1° 58'.
<i>Hook</i> and <i>Montenari</i> agree that the tail of the comet was
directed towards <i>Spica</i> ♍, declining a little from that star
towards the south according to <i>Hook</i>, but towards the north
according to <i>Montenari</i>; and, therefore, that declination was
scarcely sensible; and the tail, lying nearly parallel to the equator,
deviated a little from the opposition of the sun towards the north.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 23</i>, O. S. at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning, at <i>Nuremberg</i> (that is, at
<img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{1}{2}^{h}." src="images/1261.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1261.svg_1"> at <i>London</i>), Mr. <i>Zimmerman</i> saw the
comet in ♏ 8° 8', with 2° 31' south lat. its place being collected by
taking its distances from fixed stars.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 24</i>, before sun-rising, the comet was seen by
<i>Montenari</i> in ♏ 12° 52' on the north side of the right line
through <i>Cor Leonis</i> and <i>Spica</i> ♍, and therefore its
latitude was something less than 2° 38'; and since the latitude, as we
said, by the concurring observations of <i>Montenari</i>, <i>Ango</i>,
and <i>Hook</i>, was continually increasing, therefore, it was now, on
the 24th, something greater than 1° 58'; and, taking the mean quantity,
may be reckoned 2° 18', without any considerable error. <i>Ponthæus</i>
and <i>Galletius</i> will have it that the latitude was now decreasing;
and <i>Cellius</i>, and the observer in <i>New England</i>, that
it continued the same, viz., of about 1°, or <img alt="" data-tex="1\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/208.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_208.svg_6"><sup>°</sup>.
The observations of <i>Ponthæus</i> and <i>Cellius</i> are more
rude, especially those which were made by taking the azimuths and
altitudes; as are also the observations of <i>Galletius</i>. Those
are better which were made by taking the position of the comet to the
fixed stars by <i>Montenari</i>, <i>Hook</i>, <i>Ango</i>, and the
observer in <i>New England</i>, and sometimes by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</span> <i>Ponthæus</i> and
<i>Cellius</i>. The same day, at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning, at <i>Ballasore</i>, the
comet was observed in ♏ 11° 45'; and, therefore, at 5<sup>h</sup>. morning at
<i>London</i>, was in ♏ 13° nearly. And, by the theory, the comet was
at that time in ♏ 13° 22' 42''.</p>

<p><i>Nov. 25</i>, before sunrise, <i>Montenari</i> observed the comet in
♏ <img alt="" data-tex="17\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/871.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_871.svg_1"><sup>°</sup> nearly; and <i>Cellius</i> observed at the same
time that the comet was in a right line between the bright star in the
right thigh of Virgo and the southern scale of Libra; and this right
line cuts the comet's way in ♏ 18° 36'. And, by the theory, the comet
was in ♏ <img alt="" data-tex="18\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/1265.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1265.svg"><sup>°</sup> nearly.</p>

<p>From all this it is plain that these observations agree with the
theory, so far as they agree with one another; and by this agreement
it is made clear that it was one and the same comet that appeared all
the time from <i>Nov. 4</i> to <i>Mar. 9</i>. The path of this comet
did twice cut the plane of the ecliptic, and therefore was not a right
line. It did cut the ecliptic not in opposite parts of the heavens,
but in the end of Virgo and beginning of Capricorn, including an arc
of about 98°; and therefore the way of the comet did very much deviate
from the path of a great circle; for in the month of <i>Nov.</i> it
declined at least 3° from the ecliptic towards the south; and in the
month of <i>Dec.</i> following it declined 29° from the ecliptic
towards the north; the two parts of the orbit in which the comet
descended towards the sun, and ascended again from the sun, declining
one from the other by an apparent angle of above 30°, as observed by
<i>Montenari</i>. This comet travelled over 9 signs, to wit, from the
last deg. of ♌ to the beginning of ♊, beside the sign of ♌, through
which it passed before it began to be seen; and there is no other
theory by which a comet can go over so great a part of the heavens
with a regular motion. The motion of this comet was very unequable;
for about the 20th of <i>Nov.</i> it described about 5° a day. Then
its motion being retarded between <i>Nov. 26</i> and <i>Dec. 12</i>,
to wit, in the space of <img alt="" data-tex="15\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/863.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_863.svg_1"> days, it described only
40°. But the motion thereof being afterwards accelerated, it described
near 5° a day, till its motion began to be again retarded. And the
theory which justly corresponds with a motion so unequable, and through
so great a part of the heavens, which observes the same laws with
the theory of the planets, and which accurately agrees with accurate
astronomical observations, cannot be otherwise than true.</p>

<p>And, thinking it would not be improper, I have given a true

I made the following observations.</p>

was seen by <i>Ponthæus</i> more than 15° long; <i>Nov. 18</i>, in
<i>New-England</i>, the tail appeared 30° long, and directly opposite
to the sun, extending itself to the planet Mars, which was then in ♍,
9° 54'; <i>Nov. 19</i>. in <i>Maryland</i>, the tail was found 15° or
20° long; <i>Dec. 10</i> (by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</span> the observation of Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>),
the tail passed through the middle of the distance intercepted between
the tail of the Serpent of <i>Ophiuchus</i> and the star <img alt="" data-tex="\delta" src="images/1149.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.005ex; height: 1.645ex;" id="img_images_1149.svg_5">

in ♑ 26° 43' with latitude 38° 34' north; <i>Dec. 12</i>, it passed

terminating in ♒ 4°, with latitude <img alt="" data-tex="42\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1260.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1260.svg_1"><sup>°</sup> north nearly.
But these things are to be understood of the length of the brighter
part of the tail; for with a more faint light, observed, too, perhaps,
in a serener sky, at <i>Rome</i>, <i>Dec. 12</i>, 5<sup>h</sup>. 40', by the
observation of <i>Ponthæus</i>, the tail arose to 10° above the rump
of the Swan, and the side thereof towards the west and towards the
north was 45' distant from this star. But about that time the tail was
3° broad towards the upper end; and therefore the middle thereof was
2° 15' distant from that star towards the south, and the upper end
was ♓ in 22°, with latitude 61° north; and thence the tail was about
70° long; <i>Dec. 21</i>, it extended almost to <i>Cassiopeia's</i>
chair, equally distant from <img alt="" data-tex="\beta" src="images/1052.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.439ex; width: 1.281ex; height: 2.034ex;" id="img_images_1052.svg_7"> and from <i>Schedir</i>, so
as its distance from either of the two was equal to the distance

on its left; and, according to our observations, was 40° long; but it
was curved, and the convex side thereof lay to the south; and near the
head of the comet it made an angle of 4° with the circle which passed
through the sun and the comet's head; but towards the other end it was
inclined to that circle in an angle of about 10° or 11°; and the chord
of the tail contained with that circle an angle of 8°. <i>Jan. 13</i>,
the tail terminated between <i>Alamech</i> and <i>Algol</i>, with a
light that was sensible enough; but with a faint light it ended over
against the star <img alt="" data-tex="\kappa" src="images/1179.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 1.303ex; height: 1.025ex;" id="img_images_1179.svg_1"> in <i>Perseus's</i> side. The distance

shone with a faint light to the length of 6° or 7°; and for a night or
two after, when there was a very clear sky, it extended to the length
of 12°, or something more, with a light that was very faint and very
hardly to be seen; but the axis thereof was exactly directed to the
bright star in the eastern shoulder of <i>Auriga</i>, and therefore
deviated from the opposition of the sun towards the north by an angle
of 10°. Lastly, <i>Feb.</i> 10, with a telescope I observed the tail 2°
long; for that fainter light which I spoke of did not appear through
the glasses. But <i>Ponthæus</i> writes, that, on <i>Feb. 7</i>, he saw
the tail 12° long. <i>Feb. 25</i>, the comet was without a tail, and so
continued till it disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</span></p>

<p>Now if one reflects upon the orbit described, and duly considers the
other appearances of this comet, he will be easily satisfied that the
bodies of comets are solid, compact, fixed, and durable, like the
bodies of the planets; for if they were nothing else but the vapours
or exhalations of the earth, of the sun, and other planets, this
comet, in its passage by the neighbourhood of the sun, would have been
immediately dissipated; for the heat of the sun is as the density of
its rays, that is, reciprocally as the square of the distance of the
places from the sun. Therefore, since on <i>Dec. 8</i>, when the comet
was in its perihelion, the distance thereof from the centre of the sun
was to the distance of the earth from the same as about 6 to 1000, the
sun's heat on the comet was at that time to the heat of the summer-sun
with us as 1000000 to 36, or as 28000 to 1. But the heat of boiling
water is about 3 times greater than the heat which dry earth acquires
from the summer-sun, as I have tried; and the heat of red-hot iron (if
my conjecture is right) is about three or four times greater than the
heat of boiling water. And therefore the heat which dry earth on the
comet, while in its perihelion, might have conceived from the rays of
the sun, was about 2000 times greater than the heat of red-hot iron.
But by so fierce a heat, vapours and exhalations, and every volatile
matter, must have been immediately consumed and dissipated.</p>

<p>This comet, therefore, must have conceived an immense heat from the
sun, and retained that heat for an exceeding long time; for a globe
of iron of an inch in diameter, exposed red-hot to the open air, will
scarcely lose all its heat in an hour's time; but a greater globe would
retain its heat longer in the proportion of its diameter, because the
surface (in proportion to which it is cooled by the contact of the
ambient air) is in that proportion less in respect of the quantity of
the included hot matter; and therefore a globe of red hot iron equal
to our earth, that is, about 40000000 feet in diameter, would scarcely
cool in an equal number of days, or in above 50000 years. But I suspect
that the duration of heat may, on account of some latent causes,
increase in a yet less proportion than that of the diameter; and I
should be glad that the true proportion was investigated by experiments.</p>

<p>It is farther to be observed, that the comet in the month of
<i>December</i>, just after it had been heated by the sun, did emit
a much longer tail, and much more splendid, than in the month of
<i>November</i> before, when it had not yet arrived at its perihelion;
and, universally, the greatest and most fulgent tails always arise from
comets immediately after their passing by the neighbourhood of the sun.
Therefore the heat received by the comet conduces to the greatness of
the tail: from whence, I think I may infer, that the tail is nothing
else but a very fine vapour, which the head or nucleus of the comet
emits by its heat.</p>

<p>But we have had three several opinions about the tails of comets; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</span>
some will have it that they are nothing else but the beams of the sun's
light transmitted through the comets' heads, which they suppose to be
transparent; others, that they proceed from the refraction which light
suffers in passing from the comet's head to the earth; and, lastly,
others, that they are a sort of clouds or vapour constantly rising
from the comets' heads, and tending towards the parts opposite to the
sun. The first is the opinion of such as are yet unacquainted with
optics; for the beams of the sun are seen in a darkened room only in
consequence of the light that is reflected from them by the little
particles of dust and smoke which are always flying about in the air;
and, for that reason, in air impregnated with thick smoke, those beams
appear with great brightness, and move the sense vigorously; in a yet
finer air they appear more faint, and are less easily discerned; but
in the heavens, where there is no matter to reflect the light they
can never be seen at all. Light is not seen as it is in the beam, but
as it is thence reflected to our eyes; for vision can be no otherwise
produced than by rays falling upon the eyes; and therefore, there
must be some reflecting matter in those parts where the tails of the
comets are seen: for otherwise, since all the celestial spaces are
equally illuminated by the sun's light, no part of the heavens could
appear with more splendor than another. The second opinion is liable
to many difficulties. The tails of comets are never seen variegated
with those colours which commonly are inseparable from refraction; and
the distinct transmission of the light of the fixed stars and planets
to us is a demonstration that the æther or celestial medium is not
endowed with any refractive power: for as to what is alleged, that the
fixed stars have been sometimes seen by the <i>Egyptians</i> environed
with a <i>Coma</i> or <i>Capillitium</i>, because that has but rarely
happened, it is rather to be ascribed to a casual refraction of clouds;
and so the radiation and scintillation of the fixed stars to the
refractions both of the eyes and air; for upon laying a telescope to
the eye, those radiations and scintillations immediately disappear. By
the tremulous agitation of the air and ascending vapours, it happens
that the rays of light are alternately turned aside from the narrow
space of the pupil of the eye; but no such thing can have place in the
much wider aperture of the object-glass of a telescope; and hence it is
that a scintillation is occasioned in the former case, which ceases in
the latter; and this cessation in the latter case is a demonstration
of the regular transmission of light through the heavens, without
any sensible refraction. But, to obviate an objection that may be
made from the appearing of no tail in such comets as shine but with
a faint light, as if the secondary rays were then too weak to affect
the eyes, and for that reason it is that the tails of the fixed stars
do not appear, we are to consider, that by the means of telescopes
the light of the fixed stars may be augmented above an hundred fold,
and yet no tails are seen; that the light of the planets is yet more
copious without any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</span> tail; but that comets are seen sometimes with
huge tails, when the light of their heads is but faint and dull. For
so it happened in the comet of the year 1680, when in the month of
<i>December</i> it was scarcely equal in light to the stars of the
second magnitude, and yet emitted a notable tail, extending to the
length of 40°, 50°, 60°, or 70°, and upwards; and afterwards, on the
27th and 28th of <i>January</i>, when the head appeared but as a
star of the 7th magnitude, yet the tail (as we said above), with a
light that was sensible enough, though faint, was stretched out to 6
or 7 degrees in length, and with a languishing light that was more
difficultly seen, even to 12°, and upwards. But on the 9th and 10th
of <i>February</i>, when to the naked eye the head appeared no more,
through a telescope I viewed the tail of 2° in length. But farther; if
the tail was owing to the refraction of the celestial matter, and did
deviate from the opposition of the sun, according to the figure of the
heavens, that deviation in the same places of the heavens should be
always directed towards the same parts. But the comet of the year 1680,
<i>December</i> 28<sup>d</sup>. <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{1}{2}^{h}" src="images/1269.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.036ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1269.svg">.</span> P. M. at <i>London</i>,
was seen in ♓ 8° 41', with latitude north 28° 6'; while the sun was
in ♑ 18° 26'. And the comet of the year 1577, <i>December</i> 29<sup>d</sup>.
was in ♓ 8° 41', with latitude north 28° 40', and the sun, as before,
in about ♑ 18° 26'. In both cases the situation of the earth was the
same, and the comet appeared in the same place of the heavens; yet in
the former case the tail of the comet (as well by my observations as
by the observations of others) deviated from the opposition of the sun
towards the north by an angle of <img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1270.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1270.svg"> degrees; whereas in
the latter there was (according to the observations of <i>Tycho</i>)
a deviation of 21 degrees towards the south. The refraction,
therefore, of the heavens being thus disproved, it remains that the
<i>phænomena</i> of the tails of comets must be derived from some
reflecting matter.</p>

<p>And that the tails of comets do arise from their heads, and tend
towards the parts opposite to the sun, is farther confirmed from the
laws which the tails observe. As that, lying in the planes of the
comets' orbits which pass through the sun, they constantly deviate
from the opposition of the sun towards the parts which the comets'
heads in their progress along these orbits have left. That to a
spectator, placed in those planes, they appear in the parts directly
opposite to the sun; but, as the spectator recedes from those planes,
their deviation begins to appear, and daily becomes greater. That
the deviation, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, appears less when the tail is
more oblique to the orbit of the comet, as well as when the head of
the comet approaches nearer to the sun, especially if the angle of
deviation is estimated near the head of the comet. That the tails
which have no deviation appear straight, but the tails which deviate
are likewise bended into a certain curvature. That this curvature is
greater when the deviation is greater; and is more sensible when the
tail, <i>cæteris paribus</i> is longer; for in the shorter tails the
curvature is hardly to be perceived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</span> That the angle of deviation is
less near the comet's head, but greater towards the other end of the
tail; and that because the convex side of the tail regards the parts
from which the deviation is made, and which lie in a right line drawn
out infinitely from the sun through the comet's head. And that the
tails that are long and broad, and shine with a stronger light, appear
more resplendent and more exactly defined on the convex than on the
concave side. Upon which accounts it is plain that the <i>phænomena</i>
of the tails of comets depend upon the motions of their heads, and
by no means upon the places of the heavens in which their heads are
seen; and that, therefore, the tails of comets do not proceed from the
refraction of the heavens, but from their own heads, which furnish
the matter that forms the tail. For, as in our air, the smoke of a
heated body ascends either perpendicularly if the body is at rest, or
obliquely if the body is moved obliquely, so in the heavens, where all
bodies gravitate towards the sun, smoke and vapour must (as we have
already said) ascend from the sun, and either rise perpendicularly
if the smoking body is at rest, or obliquely if the body, in all the
progress of its motion, is always leaving those places from which
the upper or higher parts of the vapour had risen before; and that
obliquity will be least where the vapour ascends with most velocity, to
wit, near the smoking body, when that is near the sun. But, because the
obliquity varies, the column of vapour will be incurvated; and because
the vapour in the preceding sides is something more recent, that is,
has ascended something more late from the body, it will therefore be
something more dense on that side, and must on that account reflect
more light, as well as be better defined. I add nothing concerning
the sudden uncertain agitation of the tails of comets, and their
irregular figures, which authors sometimes describe, because they may
arise from the mutations of our air, and the motions of our clouds,
in part obscuring those tails; or, perhaps, from parts of the <i>Via
Lactea</i>, which might have been confounded with and mistaken for
parts of the tails of the comets as they passed by.</p>

<p>But that the atmospheres of comets may furnish a supply of vapour
great enough to fill so immense spaces, we may easily understand from
the rarity of our own air; for the air near the surface of our earth
possesses a space 850 times greater than water of the same weight;
and therefore a cylinder of air 850 feet high is of equal weight with
a cylinder of water of the same breadth, and but one foot high. But
a cylinder of air reaching to the top of the atmosphere is of equal
weight with a cylinder of water about 33 feet high: and, therefore,
if from the whole cylinder of air the lower part of 850 feet high is
taken away, the remaining upper part will be of equal weight with a
cylinder of water 32 feet high: and from thence (and by the hypothesis,
confirmed by many experiments, that the compression of air is as the
weight of the incumbent atmosphere, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</span> that the force of gravity
is reciprocally as the square of the distance from the centre of the
earth) raising a calculus, by Cor. Prop. XXII, Book II, I found, that,
at the height of one semi-diameter of the earth, reckoned from the
earth's surface, the air is more rare than with us in a far greater
proportion than of the whole space within the orb of Saturn to a
spherical space of one inch in diameter; and therefore if a sphere of
our air of but one inch in thickness was equally rarefied with the
air at the height of one semi-diameter of the earth from the earth's
surface, it would fill all the regions of the planets to the orb of
Saturn, and far beyond it. Wherefore since the air at greater distances
is immensely rarefied, and the <i>coma</i> or atmosphere of comets
is ordinarily about ten times higher, reckoning from their centres,
than the surface of the nucleus, and the tails rise yet higher, they
must therefore be exceedingly rare; and though, on account of the much
thicker atmospheres of comets, and the great gravitation of their
bodies towards the sun, as well as of the particles of their air and
vapours mutually one towards another, it may happen that the air in
the celestial spaces and in the tails of comets is not so vastly
rarefied, yet from this computation it is plain that a very small
quantity of air and vapour is abundantly sufficient to produce all the
appearances of the tails of comets: for that they are, indeed, of a
very notable rarity appears from the shining of the stars through them.
The atmosphere of the earth, illuminated by the sun's light, though
but of a few miles in thickness, quite obscures and extinguishes the
light not only of all the stars, but even of the moon itself; whereas
the smallest stars are seen to shine through the immense thickness of
the tails of comets, likewise illuminated by the sun, without the least
diminution of their splendor. Nor is the brightness of the tails of
most comets ordinarily greater than that of our air, an inch or two in
thickness, reflecting in a darkened room the light of the sun-beams let
in by a hole of the window-shutter.</p>

<p>And we may pretty nearly determine the time spent during the ascent
of the vapour from the comet's head to the extremity of the tail, by
drawing a right line from the extremity of the tail to the sun, and
marking the place where that right line intersects the comet's orbit:
for the vapour that is now in the extremity of the tail, if it has
ascended in a right line from the sun, must have begun to rise from the
head at the time when the head was in the point of intersection. It
is true, the vapour does not rise in a right line from the sun, but,
retaining the motion which it had from the comet before its ascent, and
compounding that motion with its motion of ascent, arises obliquely;
and, therefore, the solution of the Problem will be more exact, if we
draw the line which intersects the orbit parallel to the length of
the tail; or rather (because of the curvilinear motion of the comet)
diverging a little from the line or length of the tail. And by means of
this principle I found that the vapour which, <i>January 25</i>, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</span>
in the extremity of the tail, had begun to rise from the head before
<i>December 11</i>, and therefore had spent in its whole ascent 45
days; but that the whole tail which appeared on <i>December 10</i> had
finished its ascent in the space of the two days then elapsed from the
time of the comet's being in its perihelion. The vapour, therefore,
about the beginning and in the neighbourhood of the sun rose with the
greatest velocity, and afterwards continued to ascend with a motion
constantly retarded by its own gravity; and the higher it ascended,
the more it added to the length of the tail; and while the tail
continued to be seen, it was made up of almost all that vapour which
had risen since the time of the comet's being in its perihelion; nor
did that part of the vapour which had risen first, and which formed the
extremity of the tail, cease to appear, till its too great distance, as
well from the sun, from which it received its light, as from our eyes,
rendered it invisible. Whence also it is that the tails of other comets
which are short do not rise from their heads with a swift and continued
motion, and soon after disappear, but are permanent and lasting columns
of vapours and exhalations, which, ascending from the heads with a slow
motion of many days, and partaking of the motion of the heads which
they had from the beginning, continue to go along together with them
through the heavens. From whence again we have another argument proving
the celestial spaces to be free, and without resistance, since in them
not only the solid bodies of the planets and comets, but also the
extremely rare vapours of comets' tails, maintain their rapid motions
with great freedom, and for an exceeding long time.</p>

<p><i>Kepler</i> ascribes the ascent of the tails of the comets to the
atmospheres of their heads; and their direction towards the parts
opposite to the sun to the action of the rays of light carrying
along with them the matter of the comets' tails; and without any
great incongruity we may suppose, that, in so free spaces, so fine a
matter as that of the æther may yield to the action of the rays of
the sun's light, though those rays are not able sensibly to move the
gross substances in our parts, which are clogged with so palpable a
resistance. Another author thinks that there may be a sort of particles
of matter endowed with a principle of levity, as well as others are
with a power of gravity; that the matter of the tails of comets may be
of the former sort, and that its ascent from the sun may be owing to
its levity; but, considering that the gravity of terrestrial bodies
is as the matter of the bodies, and therefore can be neither more nor
less in the same quantity of matter, I am inclined to believe that
this ascent may rather proceed from the rarefaction of the matter of
the comets' tails. The ascent of smoke in a chimney is owing to the
impulse of the air with which it is entangled. The air rarefied by heat
ascends, because its specific gravity is diminished, and in its ascent
carries along with it the smoke with which it is engaged; and why may
not the tail of a comet rise from the sun after the same manner?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</span> For
the sun's rays do not act upon the mediums which they pervade otherwise
than by reflection and refraction; and those reflecting particles
heated by this action, heat the matter of the æther which is involved
with them. That matter is rarefied by the heat which it acquires, and
because, by this rarefaction, the specific gravity with which it tended
towards the sun before is diminished, it will ascend therefrom, and
carry along with it the reflecting particles of which the tail of the
comet is composed. But the ascent of the vapours is further promoted
by their circumgyration about the sun, in consequence whereof they
endeavour to recede from the sun, while the sun's atmosphere and the
other matter of the heavens are either altogether quiescent, or are
only moved with a slower circumgyration derived from the rotation of
the sun. And these are the causes of the ascent of the tails of the
comets in the neighbourhood of the sun, where their orbits are bent
into a greater curvature, and the comets themselves are plunged into
the denser and therefore heavier parts of the sun's atmosphere: upon
which account they do then emit tails of an huge length; for the tails
which then arise, retaining their own proper motion, and in the mean
time gravitating towards the sun, must be revolved in ellipses about
the sun in like manner as the heads are, and by that motion must always
accompany the heads, and freely adhere to them. For the gravitation of
the vapours towards the sun can no more force the tails to abandon the
heads, and descend to the sun, than the gravitation of the heads can
oblige them to fall from the tails. They must by their common gravity
either fall together towards the sun, or be retarded together in their
common ascent therefrom; and, therefore (whether from the causes
already described, or from any others), the tails and heads of comets
may easily acquire and freely retain any position one to the other,
without disturbance or impediment from that common gravitation.</p>

<p>The tails, therefore, that rise in the perihelion positions of the
comets will go along with their heads into far remote parts, and
together with the heads will either return again from thence to us,
after a long course of years, or rather will be there rarefied, and
by degrees quite vanish away; for afterwards, in the descent of the
heads towards the sun, new short tails will be emitted from the heads
with a slow motion; and those tails by degrees will be augmented
immensely, especially in such comets as in their perihelion distances
descend as low as the sun's atmosphere; for all vapour in those free
spaces is in a perpetual state of rarefaction and dilatation; and
from hence it is that the tails of all comets are broader at their
upper extremity than near their heads. And it is not unlikely but that
the vapour, thus perpetually rarefied and dilated, may be at last
dissipated and scattered through the whole heavens, and by little and
little be attracted towards the planets by its gravity, and mixed with
their atmosphere; for as the seas are absolutely necessary to the
constitution of our earth, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</span> from them, the sun, by its heat, may
exhale a sufficient quantity of vapours, which, being gathered together
into clouds, may drop down in rain, for watering of the earth, and for
the production and nourishment of vegetables; or, being condensed with
cold on the tops of mountains (as some philosophers with reason judge),
may run down in springs and rivers; so for the conservation of the
seas, and fluids of the planets, comets seem to be required, that, from
their exhalations and vapours condensed, the wastes of the planetary
fluids spent upon vegetation and putrefaction, and converted into dry
earth, may be continually supplied and made up; for all vegetables
entirely derive their growths from fluids, and afterwards, in great
measure, are turned into dry earth by putrefaction; and a sort of
slime is always found to settle at the bottom of putrefied fluids; and
hence it is that the bulk of the solid earth is continually increased;
and the fluids, if they are not supplied from without, must be in a
continual decrease, and quite fail at last. I suspect, moreover, that
it is chiefly from the comets that spirit comes, which is indeed the
smallest but the most subtle and useful part of our air, and so much
required to sustain the life of all things with us.</p>

<p>The atmospheres of comets, in their descent towards the sun, by running
out into the tails, are spent and diminished, and become narrower, at
least on that side which regards the sun; and in receding from the
sun, when they less run out into the tails, they are again enlarged,
if <i>Hevelius</i> has justly marked their appearances. But they are
seen least of all just after they have been most heated by the sun, and
on that account then emit the longest and most resplendent tails; and,
perhaps, at the same time, the nuclei are environed with a denser and
blacker smoke in the lowermost parts of their atmosphere; for smoke
that is raised by a great and intense heat is commonly the denser and
blacker. Thus the head of that comet which we have been describing, at
equal distances both from the sun and from the earth, appeared darker
after it had passed by its perihelion than it did before; for in the
month of <i>December</i> it was commonly compared with the stars of
the third magnitude, but in <i>November</i> with those of the first
or second; and such as saw both appearances have described the first
as of another and greater comet than the second. For, <i>November
19</i>, this comet appeared to a young man at <i>Cambridge</i>, though
with a pale and dull light, yet equal to <i>Spica Virginis</i>; and
at that time it shone with greater brightness than it did afterwards.
And <i>Montenari</i>, <i>November 20</i>, st. vet. observed it larger
than the stars of the first magnitude, its tail being then 2 degrees
long. And Mr. <i>Storer</i> (by letters which have come into my hands)
writes, that in the month of <i>December</i>, when the tail appeared
of the greatest bulk and splendor, the head was but small, and far
less than that which was seen in the month of <i>November</i> before
sun-rising; and, conjecturing at the cause of the appearance, he judged
it to proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</span> from there being a greater quantity of matter in the
head at first, which was afterwards gradually spent.</p>

<p>And, which farther makes for the same purpose, I find, that the heads
of other comets, which did put forth tails of the greatest bulk and
splendor, have appeared but obscure and small. For in <i>Brazil</i>,
<i>March 5, 1668</i>, 7<sup>h</sup>. P. M., <i>St. N. P. Valentinus Estancius</i>
saw a comet near the horizon, and towards the south west, with a head
so small as scarcely to be discerned, but with a tail above measure
splendid, so that the reflection thereof from the sea was easily seen
by those who stood upon the shore; and it looked like a fiery beam
extended 23° in length from the west to south, almost parallel to
the horizon. But this excessive splendor continued only three days,
decreasing apace afterwards: and while the splendor was decreasing,
the bulk of the tail increased: whence in <i>Portugal</i> it is said
to have taken up one quarter of the heavens, that is, 45 degrees,
extending from west to east with a very notable splendor, though the
whole tail was not seen in those parts, because the head was always
hid under the horizon: and from the increase of the bulk and decrease
of the splendor of the tail, it appears that the head was then in its
recess from the sun, and had been very near to it in its perihelion, as
the comet of 1680 was. And we read, in the <i>Saxon</i> Chronicle, of
a like comet appearing in the year 1106, <i>the star whereof was small
and obscure</i> (as that of 1680), <i>but the splendour of its tail was
very bright, and like a huge fiery beam stretched out in a direction
between the east and north</i>, as <i>Hevelius</i> has it also from
<i>Simeon</i>, the monk of <i>Durham</i>. This comet appeared in the
beginning of <i>February</i>, about the evening, and towards the south
west part of heaven; from whence, and from the position of the tail, we
infer that the head was near the sun. <i>Matthew Paris</i> says, <i>It
was distant from the sun by about a cubit, from three of the clock</i>
(rather six) <i>till nine, putting forth a long tail</i>. Such also
was that most resplendent comet described by <i>Aristotle</i>, lib. 1,
<i>Meteor.</i> 6. <i>The head whereof could not be seen, because it had
set before the sun, or at least was hid under the sun's rays; but next
day it was seen as well as might be; for, having left the sun but a
very Little way, it set immediately after it. And the scattered light
of the head, obscured by the too great splendour <span class="antiqua">(of the tail)</span>
did not yet appear. But afterwards (<span class="antiqua">as</span> Aristotle says) when the
splendour <span class="antiqua">(of the tail)</span> was now diminished <span class="antiqua">(the head of)</span>,
the comet recovered its native brightness; and the splendour <span class="antiqua">(of its
tail)</span> reached now to a third part of the heavens <span class="antiqua">(that is, to
60°)</span>. This appearance was in the winter season <span class="antiqua">(an. 4, Olymp.
101)</span>, and, rising to Orion's girdle, it there vanished away.</i> It
is true that the comet of 1618, which came out directly from under the
sun's rays with a very large tail, seemed to equal, if not to exceed,
the stars of the first magnitude; but, then, abundance of other comets
have appeared yet greater than this, that put forth shorter tails; some
of which are said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</span> to have appeared as big as Jupiter, others as big as
Venus, or even as the moon.</p>

<p>We have said, that comets are a sort of planets revolved in very
eccentric orbits about the sun; and as, in the planets which are
without tails, those are commonly less which are revolved in lesser
orbits, and nearer to the sun, so in comets it is probable that those
which in their perihelion approach nearer to the sun are generally of
less magnitude, that they may not agitate the sun too much by their
attractions. But as to the transverse diameters of their orbits, and
the periodic times of their revolutions, I leave them to be determined
by comparing comets together which after long intervals of time return
again in the same orbit. In the mean time, the following Proposition
may give some light in that inquiry.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROPOSITION XLII. PROBLEM XXII.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="nindc">
<i>To correct a comet's trajectory found as above.</i></p>
</div>

<p>OPERATION 1. Assume that position of the plane of the trajectory which
was determined according to the preceding proposition; and select
three places of the comet, deduced from very accurate observations,
and at great distances one from the other. Then suppose A to represent
the time between the first observation and the second, and B the time
between the second and the third; but it will be convenient that in
one of those times the comet be in its perigeon, or at least not far
from it. From those apparent places find, by trigonometric operations,
the three true places of the comet in that assumed plane of the
trajectory; then through the places found, and about the centre of the
sun as the focus, describe a conic section by arithmetical operations,
according to Prop. XXI., Book I. Let the areas of this figure which are
terminated by radii drawn from the sun to the places found be D and
E; to wit, D the area between the first observation and the second,
and E the area between the second and third; and let T represent the
whole time in which the whole area D + E should be described with the
velocity of the comet found by Prop. XVI., Book I.</p>

<p>OPER. 2. Retaining the inclination of the plane of the trajectory to
the plane of the ecliptic, let the longitude of the nodes of the plane
of the trajectory be increased by the addition of 20 or 30 minutes,
which call P. Then from the aforesaid three observed places of the
comet let the three true places be found (as before) in this new plane;
as also the orbit passing through those places, and the two areas of
the same described between the two observations, which call <i>d</i>
and <i>e</i>; and let <i>t</i> be the whole time in which the whole
area <i>d</i> + <i>e</i> should be described.</p>

<p>OPER. 3. Retaining the longitude of the nodes in the first operation,
let the inclination of the plane of the trajectory to the plane of
the ecliptic be increased by adding thereto 20' or 30', which call Q.
Then from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</span> aforesaid three observed apparent places of the comet
let the three true places be found in this new plane, as well as the
orbit passing through them, and the two areas of the same described
between the observation, which call <img alt="" data-tex="\delta" src="images/1149.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.023ex; width: 1.005ex; height: 1.645ex;" id="img_images_1149.svg_6"> and <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\epsilon" src="images/925.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.025ex; width: 0.919ex; height: 1ex;" id="img_images_925.svg_7">;</span> and

will be the true transverse diameter of the trajectory which the
comet describes; and from the transverse diameter given the periodic
time of the comet is also given. Q.E.I. But the periodic times of the
revolutions of comets, and the transverse diameters of their orbits,
cannot be accurately enough determined but by comparing comets together
which appear at different times. If, after equal intervals of time,
several comets are found to have described the same orbit, we may
thence conclude that they are all but one and the same comet revolved
in the same orbit; and then from the times of their revolutions the
transverse diameters of their orbits will be given, and from those
diameters the elliptic orbits themselves will be determined.</p>

<p>To this purpose the trajectories of many comets ought to be computed,
supposing those trajectories to be parabolic; for such trajectories
will always nearly agree with the <i>phænomena</i>, as appears not
only from the parabolic trajectory of the comet of the year 1680,
which I compared above with the observations, but likewise from that
of the notable comet which appeared in the year 1664 and 1665, and was
observed by <i>Hevelius</i>, who, from his own observations, calculated
the longitudes and latitudes thereof, though with little accuracy.
But from the same observations Dr. <i>Halley</i> did again compute
its places; and from those new places determined its trajectory,
finding its ascending node in ♊ 21° 13' 55''; the inclination of the
orbit to the plane of the ecliptic 21° 18' 40''; the distance of its
perihelion from the node, estimated in the comets orbit, 49° 27' 30'',
its perihelion in ♌ 8° 40' 30'', with heliocentric latitude south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</span>
16° 01' 45''; the comet to have been in its perihelion <i>November</i>
24<sup>d</sup>. 11<sup>h</sup>. 52' P.M. equal time at <i>London</i>, or 13<sup>h</sup>. 8' at
<i>Dantzick</i>, O. S.; and that the <i>latus rectum</i> of the
parabola was 410286 such parts as the sun's mean distance from the
earth is supposed to contain 100000. And how nearly the places of the
comet computed in this orbit agree with the observations, will appear
from the annexed table, calculated by Dr. <i>Halley</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>February</i>, the beginning of the year 1665, the first star

seventh magnitude, which I call A, was in ♈ 28° 24' 45'', with 8° 28'
33'' north lat. The comet <i>Feb.</i> 7<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 30' at <i>Paris</i>
(that is, <i>Feb.</i> 7<sup>d</sup>. 8<sup>h</sup>. 37' at <i>Dantzick</i>) O. S. made a

20' 26'', there will remain the longitude of the comet ♈ 27° 9' 49''.
M. <i>Auzout</i>, from this observation of his, placed the comet in ♈
27° 0', nearly; and, by the scheme in which Dr. <i>Hooke</i> delineated
its motion, it was then in ♈ 26° 59' 24''. I place it in ♈ 27° 4' 46'',
taking the middle between the two extremes.</p>

<p>From the same observations, M. <i>Auzout</i> made the latitude of
the comet at that time 7° and 4' or 5' to the north; but he had done
better to have made it 7° 3' 29'', the difference of the latitudes of
the comet and the star <img alt="" data-tex="\gamma" src="images/927.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.489ex; width: 1.229ex; height: 1.486ex;" id="img_images_927.svg_12"> being equal to the difference of the

<p><i>February</i> 22<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 30' at <i>London</i>, that is,
<i>February</i> 22<sup>d</sup>. 8<sup>h</sup>. 46' at <i>Dantzick</i>, the distance of the
comet from the star A, according to Dr. <i>Hooke's</i> observation, as
was delineated by himself in a scheme, and also by the observations of
M. <i>Auzout</i>, delineated in like manner by M. <i>Petit</i>, was a
fifth part of the distance between the star A and the first star of
Aries, or 15' 57''; and the distance of the comet from a right line
joining the star A and the first of Aries was a fourth part of the same
fifth part, that is, 4'; and therefore the comet was in ♈ 28° 29' 46'',
with 8° 12' 36'' north lat.</p>

<p><i>March 1</i>, 7<sup>h</sup>. 0' at <i>London</i>, that is, <i>March 1</i>,
8<sup>h</sup>. 16' at <i>Dantzick</i>, the comet was observed near the second
star in Aries, the distance between them being to the distance
between the first and second stars in Aries, that is, to 1° 33', as
4 to 45 according to Dr. <i>Hooke</i>, or as 2 to 23 according to M.
<i>Gottignies</i>. And, therefore, the distance of the comet from the
second star in Aries was 8' 16'' according to Dr. <i>Hooke</i>, or 8'
5'' according to M. <i>Gottignies</i>; or, taking a mean between both,
8' 10''. But, according to M. <i>Gottignies</i>, the comet had gone
beyond the second star of Aries about a fourth or a fifth part of the
space that it commonly went over in a day, to wit, about 1' 35'' (in
which he agrees very well with M. <i>Auzout</i>); or, according to Dr.
<i>Hooke</i>, not quite so much, as perhaps only 1'. Wherefore if to
the longitude of the first star in Aries we add 1', and 8' 10'' to its
latitude, we shall have the longitude of the comet ♈ 29° 18', with 8°
36' 26'' north lat.</p>

<p><i>March 7</i>, 7<sup>h</sup>. 30' at <i>Paris</i> (that is, <i>March 7</i>, 8<sup>h</sup>.
37' at <i>Dantzick</i>), from the observations of M. <i>Auzout</i>,
the distance of the comet from the second star in Aries was equal to
the distance of that star from the star<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</span> A, that is, 52' 29''; and the
difference of the longitude of the comet and the second star in Aries
was 45' or 46', or, taking a mean quantity, 45' 30''; and therefore
the comet was in ♉ 0° 2' 48''. From the scheme of the observations
of M. <i>Auzout</i>, constructed by M. <i>Petit</i>, <i>Hevelius</i>
collected the latitude of the comet 8° 54'. But the engraver did not
rightly trace the curvature of the comets way towards the end of the
motion; and <i>Hevelius</i>, in the scheme of M. <i>Auzout's</i>
observations which he constructed himself, corrected this irregular
curvature, and so made the latitude of the comet 8° 55' 30''. And, by
farther correcting this irregularity, the latitude may become 8° 56',
or 8° 57'.</p>

<p>This comet was also seen <i>March 9</i>, and at that time its place
must have been in ♉ 0° 18' with 9° <img alt="" data-tex="3\tfrac{1}{2}'" src="images/1254.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 3.554ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1254.svg_1"> north lat.
nearly.</p>

<p>This comet appeared three months together, in which space of time
it travelled over almost six signs, and in one of the days thereof
described almost 20 deg. Its course did very much deviate from a
great circle, bending towards the north, and its motion towards the
end from retrograde became direct; and, notwithstanding its course
was so uncommon, yet by the table it appears that the theory, from
beginning to end, agrees with the observations no less accurately than
the theories of the planets usually do with the observations of them;
but we are to subduct about 2' when the comet was swiftest, which we
may effect by taking off 12'' from the angle between the ascending
node and the perihelion, or by making that angle 49° 27' 18''. The
annual parallax of both these comets (this and the preceding) was very
conspicuous, and by its quantity demonstrates the annual motion of the
earth in the <i>orbis magnus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</span></p>

<p>This theory is likewise confirmed by the motion of that comet,
which in the year 1683 appeared retrograde, in an orbit whose plane
contained almost a right angle with the plane of the ecliptic, and
whose ascending node (by the computation of Dr. <i>Halley</i>) was in
♍ 23° 23'; the inclination of its orbit to the ecliptic 83° 11'; its
perihelion in ♊ 25° 29' 30''; its perihelion distance from the sun
56020 of such parts as the radius of the <i>orbis magnus</i> contains
100000; and the time of its perihelion <i>July</i> 2<sup>d</sup>. 3<sup>h</sup>. 50'. And
the places thereof, computed by Dr. <i>Halley</i> in this orbit, are
compared with the places of the same observed by Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>,

<p>This theory is yet farther confirmed by the motion of that retrograde
comet which appeared in the year 1682. The ascending node of this (by
Dr. <i>Halley's</i> computation) was in ♉ 21° 16' 30''; the inclination
of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic 17° 56' 00''; its perihelion
in ♒ 2° 52' 50''; its perihelion distance from the sun 58328 parts, of
which the radius of the <i>orbis magnus</i> contains 100000; the equal
time of the comet's being in its perihelion <i>Sept</i>. 4<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 39'.
And its places, collected from Mr. <i>Flamsted's</i> observations, are

<p>This theory is also confirmed by the retrograde motion of the comet
that appeared in the year 1723. The ascending node of this comet
(according to the computation of Mr. <i>Bradley</i>, Savilian Professor
of Astronomy at <i>Oxford</i>) was in ♈ 14° 16'. The inclination of the
orbit to the plane of the ecliptic 49° 59'. Its perihelion was in ♉ 12°
15' 20''. Its perihelion distance from the sun 998651 parts, of which
the radius of the <i>orbis magnus</i> contains 1000000, and the equal

<p>From these examples it is abundantly evident that the motions of comets
are no less accurately represented by our theory than the motions of
the planets commonly are by the theories of them; and, therefore,
by means of this theory, we may enumerate the orbits of comets, and
so discover the periodic time of a comet's revolution in any orbit;
whence, at last, we shall have the transverse diameters of their
elliptic orbits and their aphelion distances.</p>

<p>That retrograde comet which appeared in the year 1607 described
an orbit whose ascending node (according to Dr. <i>Halley's</i>
computation) was in ♉ 20° 21'; and the inclination of the plane of
the orbit to the plane of the ecliptic 17° 2'; whose perihelion was
in ♒ 2° 16'; and its perihelion distance from the sun 58680 of such
parts as the radius of the <i>orbis magnus</i> contains 100000; and
the comet was in its perihelion <i>October</i> 16<sup>d</sup>. 3<sup>h</sup>. 50'; which
orbit agrees very nearly with the orbit of the comet which was seen in
1682. If these were not two different comets, but one and the same,
that comet will finish one revolution in the space of 75 years; and the
greater axis of its orbit will be to the greater axis of the <i>orbis
magnus</i> as <img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt[3]{75 \times\, 75}" src="images/1280.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.239ex; width: 9.598ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_1280.svg"> to 1, or as 1778 to 100,
nearly. And the aphelion distance of this comet from the sun will be
to the mean distance of the earth from the sun as about 35 to 1; from
which data it will be no hard matter to determine the elliptic orbit
of this comet. But these things are to be supposed on condition, that,
after the space of 75 years, the same comet shall return again in the
same orbit. The other comets seem to ascend to greater heights, and to
require a longer time to perform their revolutions.</p>

<p>But, because of the great number of comets, of the great distance of
their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</span> aphelions from the sun, and of the slowness of their motions in
the aphelions, they will, by their mutual gravitations, disturb each
other; so that their eccentricities and the times of their revolutions
will be sometimes a little increased, and sometimes diminished.
Therefore we are not to expect that the same comet will return
exactly in the same orbit, and in the same periodic times: it will be
sufficient if we find the changes no greater than may arise from the
causes just spoken of.</p>

<p>And hence a reason may be assigned why comets are not comprehended
within the limits of a zodiac, as the planets are; but, being confined
to no bounds, are with various motions dispersed all over the heavens;
namely, to this purpose, that in their aphelions, where their motions
are exceedingly slow, receding to greater distances one from another,
they may suffer less disturbance from their mutual gravitations: and
hence it is that the comets which descend the lowest, and therefore
move the slowest in their aphelions, ought also to ascend the highest.</p>

<p>The comet which appeared in the year 1680 was in its perihelion less
distant from the sun than by a sixth part of the sun's diameter; and
because of its extreme velocity in that proximity to the sun, and some
density of the sun's atmosphere, it must have suffered some resistance
and retardation; and therefore, being attracted something nearer to the
sun in every revolution, will at last fall down upon the body of the
sun. Nay, in its aphelion, where it moves the slowest, it may sometimes
happen to be yet farther retarded by the attractions of other comets,
and in consequence of this retardation descend to the sun. So fixed
stars, that have been gradually wasted by the light and vapours emitted
from them for a long time, may be recruited by comets that fall upon
them; and from this fresh supply of new fuel those old stars, acquiring
new splendor, may pass for new stars. Of this kind are such fixed
stars as appear on a sudden, and shine with a wonderful brightness
at first, and afterwards vanish by little and little. Such was that
star which appeared in <i>Cassiopeia's</i> chair; which <i>Cornelius
Gemma</i> did not see upon the 8th of <i>November</i>, 1572, though he
was observing that part of the heavens upon that very night, and the
sky was perfectly serene; but the next night (<i>November 9</i>) he
saw it shining much brighter than any of the fixed stars, and scarcely
inferior to <i>Venus</i> in splendor. <i>Tycho Brahe</i> saw it upon
the 11th of the same month, when it shone with the greatest lustre; and
from that time he observed it to decay by little and little; and in 16
months' time it entirely disappeared. In the month of <i>November</i>,
when it first appeared, its light was equal to that of <i>Venus</i>.
In the month of <i>December</i> its light was a little diminished,
and was now become equal to that of <i>Jupiter</i>. In <i>January</i>
1573 it was less than <i>Jupiter</i>, and greater than <i>Sirius</i>;
and about the end of <i>February</i> and the beginning of <i>March</i>
became equal to that star. In the months of <i>April</i> and <i>May</i>
it was equal to a star of the second magnitude;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</span> in <i>June</i>,
<i>July</i>, and <i>August</i>, to a star of the third magnitude; in
<i>September</i>, <i>October</i>, and <i>November</i>, to those of the
fourth magnitude; in <i>December</i> and <i>January 1574</i> to those
of the fifth; in <i>February</i> to those of the sixth magnitude; and
in <i>March</i> it entirely vanished. Its colour at the beginning was
clear, bright, and inclining to white; afterwards it turned a little
yellow; and in <i>March 1573</i> it became ruddy, like <i>Mars</i> or
<i>Aldebaran</i>: in <i>May</i> it turned to a kind of dusky whiteness,
like that we observe in <i>Saturn</i>; and that colour it retained ever
after, but growing always more and more obscure. Such also was the
star in the right foot of <i>Serpentarius</i>, which <i>Kepler's</i>
scholars first observed <i>September 30</i>, O.S. 1604, with a light
exceeding that of <i>Jupiter</i>, though the night before it was not to
be seen; and from that time it decreased by little and little, and in
15 or 16 months entirely disappeared. Such a new star appearing with an
unusual splendor is said to have moved <i>Hipparchus</i> to observe,
and make a catalogue of, the fixed stars. As to those fixed stars that
appear and disappear by turns, and increase slowly and by degrees, and
scarcely ever exceed the stars of the third magnitude, they seem to be
of another kind, which revolve about their axes, and, having a light
and a dark side, shew those two different sides by turns. The vapours
which arise from the sun, the fixed stars, and the tails of the comets,
may meet at last with, and fall into, the atmospheres of the planets by
their gravity, and there be condensed and turned into water and humid
spirits; and from thence, by a slow heat, pass gradually into the form
of salts, and sulphurs, and tinctures, and mud, and clay, and sand, and
stones, and coral, and other terrestrial substances.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">GENERAL SCHOLIUM.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of vortices is pressed with many difficulties.
That every planet by a radius drawn to the sun may describe areas
proportional to the times of description, the periodic times of the
several parts of the vortices should observe the duplicate proportion
of their distances from the sun; but that the periodic times of the
planets may obtain the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances from
the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the vortex ought to be
in the sesquiplicate proportion of their distances. That the smaller
vortices may maintain their lesser revolutions about <i>Saturn</i>,
<i>Jupiter</i>, and other planets, and swim quietly and undisturbed in
the greater vortex of the sun, the periodic times of the parts of the
sun's vortex should be equal; but the rotation of the sun and planets
about their axes, which ought to correspond with the motions of their
vortices, recede far from all these proportions. The motions of the
comets are exceedingly regular, are governed by the same laws with the
motions of the planets, and can by no means be accounted for by the
hypothesis of vortices; for comets are carried with very eccentric
motions through all parts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</span> heavens indifferently, with a freedom
that is incompatible with the notion of a vortex.</p>

<p>Bodies projected in our air suffer no resistance but from the air.
Withdraw the air, as is done in Mr. <i>Boyle's</i> vacuum, and the
resistance ceases; for in this void a bit of fine down and a piece
of solid gold descend with equal velocity. And the parity of reason
must take place in the celestial spaces above the earth's atmosphere;
in which spaces, where there is no air to resist their motions, all
bodies will move with the greatest freedom; and the planets and comets
will constantly pursue their revolutions in orbits given in kind and
position, according to the laws above explained; but though these
bodies may, indeed, persevere in their orbits by the mere laws of
gravity, yet they could by no means have at first derived the regular
position of the orbits themselves from those laws.</p>

<p>The six primary planets are revolved about the sun in circles
concentric with the sun, and with motions directed towards the same
parts, and almost in the same plane. Ten moons are revolved about
the earth, Jupiter and Saturn, in circles concentric with them, with
the same direction of motion, and nearly in the planes of the orbits
of those planets; but it is not to be conceived that mere mechanical
causes could give birth to so many regular motions, since the comets
range over all parts of the heavens in very eccentric orbits; for by
that kind of motion they pass easily through the orbs of the planets,
and with great rapidity; and in their aphelions, where they move the
slowest, and are detained the longest, they recede to the greatest
distances from each other, and thence suffer the least disturbance
from their mutual attractions. This most beautiful system of the sun,
planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion
of an intelligent and powerful Being. And if the fixed stars are the
centres of other like systems, these, being formed by the like wise
counsel, must be all subject to the dominion of One; especially since
the light of the fixed stars is of the same nature with the light of
the sun, and from every system light passes into all the other systems:
and lest the systems of the fixed stars should, by their gravity,
fall on each other mutually, he hath placed those systems at immense
distances one from another.</p>

<p>This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as
Lord over all; and on account of his dominion he is wont to be called
<i>Lord God</i> παντοκράτωρ, or <i>Universal Ruler</i>; for <i>God</i>
is a relative word, and has a respect to servants; and <i>Deity</i> is
the dominion of God not over his own body, as those imagine who fancy
God to be the soul of the world, but over servants. The Supreme God is
a Being eternal, infinite, absolutely perfect; but a being, however
perfect, without dominion, cannot be said to be Lord God; for we say,
my God, your God, the God of <i>Israel</i>, the God of Gods, and Lord
of Lords; but we do not say, my Eternal, your Eternal, the Eternal of
<i>Israel</i>, the Eternal of Gods; we do not say, my Infinite, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</span>
my Perfect: these are titles which have no respect to servants. The
word <i>God</i><a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a> usually signifies <i>Lord</i>; but every lord is
not a God. It is the dominion of a spiritual being which constitutes
a God: a true, supreme, or imaginary dominion makes a true, supreme,
or imaginary God. And from his true dominion it follows that the true
God is a living, intelligent, and powerful Being; and, from his other
perfections, that he is supreme, or most perfect. He is eternal and
infinite, omnipotent and omniscient; that is, his duration reaches
from eternity to eternity; his presence from infinity to infinity;
he governs all things, and knows all things that are or can be done.
He is not eternity or infinity, but eternal and infinite; he is not
duration or space, but he endures and is present. He endures for
ever, and is every where present; and by existing always and every
where, he constitutes duration and space. Since every particle of
space is <i>always</i>, and every indivisible moment of duration is
<i>every where</i>, certainly the Maker and Lord of all things cannot
be <i>never</i> and <i>no where</i>. Every soul that has perception
is, though in different times and in different organs of sense and
motion, still the same indivisible person. There are given successive
parts in duration, co-existent parts in space, but neither the one
nor the other in the person of a man, or his thinking principle; and
much less can they be found in the thinking substance of God. Every
man, so far as he is a thing that has perception, is one and the same
man during his whole life, in all and each of his organs of sense.
God is the same God, always and every where. He is omnipresent not
<i>virtually</i> only, but also <i>substantially</i>; for virtue
cannot subsist without substance. In him<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2">[2]</a> are all things contained
and moved; yet neither affects the other: God suffers nothing from the
motion of bodies; bodies find no resistance from the omnipresence of
God. It is allowed by all that the Supreme God exists necessarily; and
by the same necessity he exists <i>always</i> and <i>every where</i>.
Whence also he is all similar, all eye, all ear, all brain, all arm,
all power to perceive, to understand, and to act; but in a manner not
at all human, in a manner not at all corporeal, in a manner utterly
unknown to us. As a blind man has no idea of colours, so have we no
idea of the manner by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</span> which the all-wise God perceives and understands
all things. He is utterly void of all body and bodily figure, and can
therefore neither be seen, nor heard, nor touched; nor ought he to be
worshipped under the representation of any corporeal thing. We have
ideas of his attributes, but what the real substance of any thing is
we know not. In bodies, we see only their figures and colours, we hear
only the sounds, we touch only their outward surfaces, we smell only
the smells, and taste the savours; but their inward substances are not
to be known either by our senses, or by any reflex act of our minds:
much less, then, have we any idea of the substance of God. We know him
only by his most wise and excellent contrivances of things, and final
causes; we admire him for his perfections; but we reverence and adore
him on account of his dominion: for we adore him as his servants; and
a god without dominion, providence, and final causes, is nothing else
but Fate and Nature. Blind metaphysical necessity, which is certainly
the same always and every where, could produce no variety of things.
All that diversity of natural things which we find suited to different
times and places could arise from nothing but the ideas and will of
a Being necessarily existing. But, by way of allegory, God is said
to see, to speak, to laugh, to love, to hate, to desire, to give, to
receive, to rejoice, to be angry, to fight, to frame, to work, to
build; for all our notions of God are taken from the ways of mankind
by a certain similitude, which, though not perfect, has some likeness,
however. And thus much concerning God; to discourse of whom from the
appearances of things, does certainly belong to Natural Philosophy.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have explained the phænomena of the heavens and of our
sea by the power of gravity, but have not yet assigned the cause
of this power. This is certain, that it must proceed from a cause
that penetrates to the very centres of the sun and planets, without
suffering the least diminution of its force; that operates not
according to the quantity of the surfaces of the particles upon which
it acts (as mechanical causes use to do), but according to the quantity
of the solid matter which they contain, and propagates its virtue on
all sides to immense distances, decreasing always in the duplicate
proportion of the distances. Gravitation towards the sun is made up
out of the gravitations towards the several particles of which the
body of the sun is composed; and in receding from the sun decreases
accurately in the duplicate proportion of the distances as far as
the orb of Saturn, as evidently appears from the quiescence of the
aphelions of the planets; nay, and even to the remotest aphelions of
the comets, if those aphelions are also quiescent. But hitherto I have
not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from
phænomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from
the phænomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether
metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical,
have no place in experimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</span> philosophy. In this philosophy
particular propositions are inferred from the phænomena, and afterwards
rendered general by induction. Thus it was that the impenetrability,
the mobility, and the impulsive force of bodies, and the laws of motion
and of gravitation, were discovered. And to us it is enough that
gravity does really exist, and act according to the laws which we have
explained, and abundantly serves to account for all the motions of the
celestial bodies, and of our sea.</p>

<p>And now we might add something concerning a certain most subtle Spirit
which pervades and lies hid in all gross bodies; by the force and
action of which Spirit the particles of bodies mutually attract one
another at near distances, and cohere, if contiguous; and electric
bodies operate to greater distances, as well repelling as attracting
the neighbouring corpuscles; and light is emitted, reflected,
refracted, inflected, and heats bodies; and all sensation is excited,
and the members of animal bodies move at the command of the will,
namely, by the vibrations of this Spirit, mutually propagated along
the solid filaments of the nerves, from the outward organs of sense
to the brain, and from the brain into the muscles. But these are
things that cannot be explained in few words, nor are we furnished
with that sufficiency of experiments which is required to an accurate
determination and demonstration of the laws by which this electric and
elastic Spirit operates.</p>

<p>It was the ancient opinion of not a few, in the earliest ages of
philosophy, that the fixed stars stood immoveable in the highest parts
of the world; that under the fixed stars the planets were carried about
the sun; that the earth, as one of the planets, described an annual
course about the sun, while by a diurnal motion it was in the mean time
revolved about its own axis; and that the sun, as the common fire which
served to warm the whole, was fixed in the centre of the universe.</p>

<p>This was the philosophy taught of old by <i>Philolaus</i>,
<i>Aristarchus</i> of <i>Samos</i>, <i>Plato</i> in his riper years,
and the whole sect of the <i>Pythagoreans</i>; and this was the
judgment of <i>Anaximander</i>, more ancient than any of them; and of
that wise king of the <i>Romans</i>, <i>Numa Pompilius</i>, who, as a
symbol of the figure of the world with the sun in the centre, erected
a temple in honour of <i>Vesta</i>, of a round form, and ordained
perpetual fire to be kept in the middle of it.</p>

<p>The <i>Egyptians</i> were early observers of the heavens; and from
them, probably, this philosophy was spread abroad among other
nations; for from them it was, and the nations about them, that the
<i>Greeks</i>, a people of themselves more addicted to the study of
philology than of nature, derived their first, as well as soundest,
notions of philosophy; and in the vestal ceremonies we may yet trace
the ancient spirit of the <i>Egyptians</i>; for it was their way to
deliver their mysteries, that is, their philosophy of things above
the vulgar way of thinking, under the veil of religious rites and
hieroglyphic symbols.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied but that <i>Anaxagoras</i>, <i>Democritus</i>,
and others, did now and then start up, who would have it that the earth
possessed the centre of the world, and that the stars of all sorts were
revolved towards the west about the earth quiescent in the centre, some
at a swifter, others at a slower rate.</p>

<p>However, it was agreed on both sides that the motions of the
celestial bodies were performed in spaces altogether free and void of
resistance. The whim of solid orbs was of a later date, introduced by
<i>Eudoxus</i>, <i>Calippus</i>, and <i>Aristotle</i>; when the ancient
philosophy began to decline, and to give place to the new prevailing
fictions of the Greeks.</p>

<p>But, above all things, the phænomena of comets can by no means consist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</span>
with the notion of solid orbs. The <i>Chaldeans</i>, the most learned
astronomers of their time, looked upon the comets (which of ancient
times before had been numbered among the celestial bodies) as a
particular sort of planets, which, describing very eccentric orbits,
presented themselves to our view only by turns, viz., once in a
revolution, when they descended into the lower parts of their orbits.</p>

<p>And as it was the unavoidable consequence of the hypothesis of solid
orbs, while it prevailed, that the comets should be thrust down below
the moon, so no sooner had the late observations of astronomers
restored the comets to their ancient places in the higher heavens, but
these celestial spaces were at once cleared of the incumbrance of solid
orbs, which by these observations were broke into pieces, and discarded
for ever.</p>

<p>Whence it was that the planets came to be retained within any certain
bounds in these free spaces, and to be drawn off from the rectilinear
courses, which, left to themselves, they should have pursued, into
regular revolutions in curvilinear orbits, are questions which we do
not know how the ancients explained; and probably it was to give some
sort of satisfaction to this difficulty that solid orbs were introduced.</p>

<p>The later philosophers pretend to account for it either by the action
of certain vortices, as <i>Kepler</i> and <i>Des Cartes</i>; or by
some other principle of impulse or attraction, as <i>Borelli</i>,
<i>Hooke</i>, and others of our nation; for, from the laws of motion,
it is most certain that these effects must proceed from the action of
some force or other.</p>

<p>But our purpose is only to trace out the quantity and properties of
this force from the phænomena (<a href="#Page_218" class="pginternal">p. 218</a>), and to apply what we discover
in some simple cases as principles, by which, in a mathematical way,
we may estimate the effects thereof in more involved cases; for it
would be endless and impossible to bring every particular to direct and
immediate observation.</p>

<p>We said, <i>in a mathematical way</i>, to avoid all questions about the
nature or quality of this force, which we would not be understood to
determine by any hypothesis; and therefore call it by the general name
of a centripetal force, as it is a force which is directed towards some
centre; and as it regards more particularly a body in that centre, we
call it circum-solar, circum-terrestrial, circum-jovial; and in like
manner in respect of other central bodies.</p>

<p>That by means of centripetal forces the planets may be retained in
certain orbits, we may easily understand, if we consider the motions of
projectiles (<a href="#Page_75" class="pginternal">p. 75</a>, <a href="#Page_76" class="pginternal">76</a>, <a href="#Page_77" class="pginternal">77</a>); for a stone projected is by the pressure
of its own weight forced out of the rectilinear path, which by the
projection alone it should have pursued, and made to describe a curve
line in the air; and through that crooked way is at last brought
down to the ground; and the greater the velocity is with which it is
projected, the farther it goes before it falls to the earth. We may
therefore suppose the velocity to be so increased,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</span> that it would
describe an arc of 1, 2, 5,10, 100, 1000 miles before it arrived at the
earth, till at last, exceeding the limits of the earth, it should pass
quite by without touching it.</p>

</figure>

<p>Let AFB represent the surface of the earth, C its centre, VD, VE,
VF, the curve lines which a body would describe, if projected in an
horizontal direction from the top of an high mountain successively with
more and more velocity (<a href="#Page_400" class="pginternal">p. 400</a>); and, because the celestial motions are
scarcely retarded by the little or no resistance of the spaces in which
they are performed, to keep up the parity of cases, let us suppose
either that there is no air about the earth, or at least that it is
endowed with little or no power of resisting; and for the same reason
that the body projected with a less velocity describes the lesser arc
VD, and with a greater velocity the greater arc VE, and, augmenting the
velocity, it goes farther and farther to F and G, if the velocity was
still more and more augmented, it would reach at last quite beyond the
circumference of the earth, and return to the mountain from which it
was projected.</p>

<p>And since the areas which by this motion it describes by a radius
drawn to the centre of the earth are (by Prop. 1, Book I, <i>Princip.
Math.</i>) proportional to the times in which they are described, its
velocity, when it returns to the mountain, will be no less than it was
at first; and, retaining the same velocity, it will describe the same
curve over and over, by the same law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</span></p>

<p>But if we now imagine bodies to be projected in the directions of lines
parallel to the horizon from greater heights, as of 5, 10, 100, 1000,
or more miles, or rather as many semi-diameters of the earth, those
bodies, according to their different velocity, and the different force
of gravity in different heights, will describe arcs either concentric
with the earth, or variously eccentric, and go on revolving through the
heavens in those trajectories, just as the planets do in their orbs.</p>

<p>As when a stone is projected obliquely, that is, any way but in the
perpendicular direction, the perpetual deflection thereof towards the
earth from the right line in which it was projected is a proof of its
gravitation to the earth, no less certain than its direct descent when
only suffered to fall freely from rest; so the deviation of bodies
moving in free spaces from rectilinear paths, and perpetual deflection
therefrom towards any place, is a sure indication of the existence of
some force which from all quarters impels those bodies towards that
place.</p>

<p>And as, from the supposed existence of gravity, it necessarily follows
that all bodies about the earth must press downwards, and therefore
must either descend directly to the earth, if they are let fall from
rest, or at least perpetually deviate from right lines towards the
earth if they are projected obliquely; so from the supposed existence
of a force directed to any centre, it will follow, by the like
necessity, that all bodies upon which this force acts must either
descend directly to that centre, or at least deviate perpetually
towards it from right lines, if otherwise they should have moved
obliquely in these right lines.</p>

<p>And how from the motions given we may infer the forces, or from the
forces given we may determine the motions, is shewn in the two first
Books of our <i>Principles of Philosophy</i>.</p>

<p>If the earth is supposed to stand still, and the fixed stars to be
revolved in free spaces in the space of 24 hours, it is certain the
forces by which the fixed stars are retained in their orbs are not
directed to the earth, but to the centres of the several orbs, that
is, of the several parallel circles, which the fixed stars, declining
to one side and the other from the equator, describe daily; also that
by radii drawn to the centres of those orbs the fixed stars describe
areas exactly proportional to the times of description. Then, because
the periodic times are equal (by Cor. III, Prop. IV, Book I), it
follows that the centripetal forces are as the radii of the several
orbs, and that they will perpetually revolve in the same orbs. And the
like consequences may be drawn from the supposed diurnal motion of the
planets.</p>

<p>That forces should be directed to no body on which they physically
depend, but to innumerable imaginary points in the axis of the earth,
is an hypothesis too incongruous. It is more incongruous still that
those forces should increase exactly in proportion of the distances
from this axis; for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</span> this is an indication of an increase to immensity,
or rather to infinity; whereas the forces of natural things commonly
decrease in receding from the fountain from which they flow. But,
what is yet more absurd, neither are the areas described by the same
star proportional to the times, nor are its revolutions performed in
the same orb; for as the star recedes from the neighbouring pole,
both areas and orb increase; and from the increase of the area it is
demonstrated that the forces are not directed to the axis of the earth.
And this difficulty (Cor. 1, Prop. II) arises from the twofold motion
that is observed in the fixed stars, one diurnal round the axis of the
earth, the other exceedingly slow round the axis of the ecliptic. And
the explication thereof requires a composition of forces so perplexed
and so variable, that it is hardly to be reconciled with any physical
theory.</p>

<p>That there are centripetal forces actually directed to the bodies of
the sun, of the earth, and other planets, I thus infer.</p>

<p>The moon revolves about our earth, and by radii drawn to its centre
(<a href="#Page_390" class="pginternal">p. 390</a>) describes areas nearly proportional to
the times in which they are described, as is evident from its velocity
compared with its apparent diameter; for its motion is slower when its
diameter is less (and therefore its distance greater), and its motion
is swifter when its diameter is greater.</p>

<p>The revolutions of the satellites of Jupiter about that planet are more
regular (<a href="#Page_386" class="pginternal">p. 386</a>); for they describe circles concentric with Jupiter by
equable motions, as exactly as our senses can distinguish.</p>

<p>And so the satellites of Saturn are revolved about this planet with
motions nearly (<a href="#Page_387" class="pginternal">p. 387</a>) circular and equable, scarcely disturbed by any
eccentricity hitherto observed.</p>

<p>That Venus and Mercury are revolved about the sun, is demonstrable from
their moon-like appearances (<a href="#Page_388" class="pginternal">p. 388</a>); when they shine with a full face,
they are in those parts of their orbs which in respect of the earth lie
beyond the sun; when they appear half full, they are in those parts
which lie over against the sun; when horned, in those parts which lie
between the earth and the sun; and sometimes they pass over the sun's
disk, when directly interposed between the earth and the sun.</p>

<p>And Venus, with a motion almost uniform, describes an orb nearly circular
and concentric with the sun.</p>

<p>But Mercury, with a more eccentric motion, makes remarkable approaches
to the sun, and goes off again by turns; but it is always swifter as it
is near to the sun, and therefore by a radius drawn to the sun still
describes areas proportional to the times.</p>

<p>Lastly, that the earth describes about the sun, or the sun about
the earth, by a radius from the one to the other, areas exactly
proportional to the times, is demonstrable from the apparent diameter
of the sun compared with its apparent motion.</p>

<p>These are astronomical experiments; from which it follows, by Prop.
I,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</span> II, III, in the first Book of our <i>Principles</i>, and their
Corollaries (<a href="#Page_212" class="pginternal">p. 212</a>, <a href="#Page_213" class="pginternal">213</a>, <a href="#Page_214" class="pginternal">214</a>), that there are centripetal forces
actually directed (either accurately or without considerable error) to
the centres of the earth, of Jupiter, of Saturn, and of the sun. In
Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the lesser planets, where experiments are
wanting, the arguments from analogy must be allowed in their place.</p>

<p>That those forces (<a href="#Page_212" class="pginternal">p. 212</a>, <a href="#Page_213" class="pginternal">213</a>, <a href="#Page_214" class="pginternal">214</a>) decrease in the duplicate
proportion of the distances from the centre of every planet, appears
by Cor. VI, Prop. IV, Book I; for the periodic times of the satellites
of Jupiter are one to another (<a href="#Page_386" class="pginternal">p. 386</a>, <a href="#Page_387" class="pginternal">387</a>) in the sesquiplicate
proportion of their distances from the centre of this planet.</p>

<p>This proportion has been long ago observed in those satellites; and Mr.
<i>Flamsted</i>, who had often measured their distances from Jupiter
by the micrometer, and by the eclipses of the satellites, wrote to
me, that it holds to all the accuracy that possibly can be discerned
by our senses. And he sent me the dimensions of their orbits taken by
the micrometer, and reduced to the mean distance of Jupiter from the
earth, or from the sun, together with the times of their revolutions,
as follows:—</p>

<p>And the periodic times of those satellites, by the observations of Mr.
<i>Flamsted</i>, are 1<sup>d</sup>. 18<sup>h</sup>. 28' 36'' | 3<sup>d</sup>. 13". 17' 54'' | 7<sup>d</sup>.
3<sup>h</sup>. 59' 36'' | 16<sup>d</sup>. 18<sup>h</sup>. 5' 13'', as above.</p>

<p>And the distances thence computed are 5,578 | 8,878 | 14,168 | 24,968,
accurately agreeing with the distances by observation.</p>

<p><i>Cassini</i> assures us (<a href="#Page_388" class="pginternal">p. 388</a>, <a href="#Page_389" class="pginternal">389</a>) that the same proportion
is observed in the circum-saturnal planets. But a longer course of
observations is required before we can have a certain and accurate
theory of those planets.</p>

<p>In the circum-solar planets, Mercury and Venus, the same proportion
holds with great accuracy, according to the dimensions of their orbs,
as determined by the observations of the best astronomers.</p>

<p>That Mars is revolved about the sun is demonstrated from the phases
which it shews, and the proportion of its apparent diameters (<a href="#Page_388" class="pginternal">p. 388</a>, <a href="#Page_389" class="pginternal">389</a>, and <a href="#Page_390" class="pginternal">390</a>);
for from its appearing full near conjunction with the sun, and gibbous
in its quadratures, it is certain that it surrounds the sun.</p>

<p>And since its diameter appears about five times greater when in
opposition to the sun than when in conjunction therewith, and its
distance from the earth is reciprocally as its apparent diameter, that
distance will be about five times less when in opposition to than when
in conjunction with the sun; but in both cases its distance from the
sun will be nearly about the same with the distance which is inferred
from its gibbous appearance in the quadratures. And as it encompasses
the sun at almost equal distances, but in respect of the earth is very
unequally distant, so by radii drawn to the sun it describes areas
nearly uniform; but by radii drawn to the earth, it is sometimes swift,
sometimes stationary, and sometimes retrograde.</p>

<p>That Jupiter, in a higher orb than Mars, is likewise revolved about the
sun, with a motion nearly equable, as well in distance as in the areas
described, I infer thus.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> assured me, by letters, that all the eclipses of
the innermost satellite which hitherto have been well observed do
agree with his theory so nearly, as never to differ therefrom by two
minutes of time; that in the outmost the error is little greater;
in the outmost but one, scarcely three times greater; that in the
innermost but one the difference is indeed much greater, yet so as to
agree as nearly with his computations as the moon does with the common
tables; and that he computes those eclipses only from the mean motions
corrected by the equation of light discovered and introduced by Mr.
<i>Romer</i>. Supposing, then, that the theory differs by a less error
than that of 2' from the motion of the outmost satellite as hitherto
described, and taking as the periodic time 16<sup>d</sup>. 18<sup>h</sup>. 5' 13'' to 2' in
time, so is the whole circle or 360° to the arc 1' 48'', the error of
Mr. <i>Flamsted's</i> computation, reduced to the satellite's orbit,
will be less than 1' 48''; that is, the longitude of the satellite, as
seen from the centre of Jupiter, will be determined with a less error
than 1' 48''. But when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</span> the satellite is in the middle of the shadow,
that longitude is the same with the heliocentric longitude of Jupiter;
and, therefore, the hypothesis which Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> follows, viz.,
the <i>Copernican</i>, as improved by <i>Kepler</i>, and (as to the
motion of Jupiter) lately corrected by himself, rightly represents that
longitude within a less error than 1' 48''; but by this longitude,
together with the geocentric longitude, which is always easily found,
the distance of Jupiter from the sun is determined; which must,
therefore, be the very same with that which the hypothesis exhibits.
For that greatest error of 1' 48'' that can happen in the heliocentric
longitude is almost insensible, and quite to be neglected, and perhaps
may arise from some yet undiscovered eccentricity of the satellite; but
since both longitude and distance are rightly determined, it follows of
necessity that Jupiter, by radii drawn to the sun, describes areas so
conditioned as the hypothesis requires, that is, proportional to the
times.</p>

<p>And the same thing may be concluded of Saturn from his satellite, by
the observations of Mr. <i>Huygens</i> and Dr. <i>Halley</i>; though a
longer series of observations is yet wanting to confirm the thing, and
to bring it under a sufficiently exact computation.</p>

<p>For if Jupiter was viewed from the sun, it would never appear
retrograde nor stationary, as it is seen sometimes from the earth, but
always to go forward with a motion nearly uniform (<a href="#Page_389" class="pginternal">p. 389</a>). And from
the very great inequality of its apparent geocentric motion, we infer
(by Prop. III Cor. IV) that the force by which Jupiter is turned out of
a rectilinear course, and made to revolve in an orb, is not directed
to the centre of the earth. And the same argument holds good in Mars
and in Saturn. Another centre of these forces is therefore to be looked
for (by Prop. II and III, and the Corollaries of the latter), about
which the areas described by radii intervening may be equable; and that
this is the sun, we have proved already in Mars and Saturn nearly,
but accurately enough in Jupiter. It may be alledged that the sun and
planets are impelled by some other force equally and in the direction
of parallel lines; but by such a force (by Cor. VI of the Laws of
Motion) no change would happen in the situation of the planets one
to another, nor any sensible effect follow: but our business is with
the causes of sensible effects. Let us, therefore, neglect every such
force as imaginary and precarious, and of no use in the phænomena of
the heavens; and the whole remaining force by which Jupiter is impelled
will be directed (by Prop. III, Cor. I) to the centre of the sun.</p>

<p>The distances of the planets from the sun come out the same, whether,
with <i>Tycho</i>, we place the earth in the centre of the system, or
the sun with <i>Copernicus</i>: and we have already proved that these
distances are true in Jupiter.</p>

<p><i>Kepler</i> and <i>Bullialdus</i> have, with great care (<a href="#Page_388" class="pginternal">p. 388</a>),
determined the distances of the planets from the sun; and hence it is
that their tables<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</span> agree best with the heavens. And in all the planets,
in Jupiter and Mars, in Saturn and the earth, as well as in Venus and
Mercury, the cubes of their distances are as the squares of their
periodic times; and therefore (by Cor. VI, Prop. IV) the centripetal
circum-solar force throughout all the planetary regions decreases in
the duplicate proportion of the distances from the sun. In examining
this proportion, we are to use the mean distances, or the transverse
semi-axes of the orbits (by Prop. XV), and to neglect those little
fractions, which, in defining the orbits, may have arisen from the
insensible errors of observation, or may be ascribed to other causes
which we shall afterwards explain. And thus we shall always find the
said proportion to hold exactly; for the distances of Saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, the Earth, Venus, and Mercury, from the sun, drawn from the
observations of astronomers, are, according to the computation of
<i>Kepler</i>, as the numbers 951000, 519650, 152350, 100000, 72400,
38806; by the computation of <i>Bullialdus</i>, as the numbers 954198,
522520, 152350, 100000, 72398, 38585; and from the periodic times they
come out 953806, 520116, 152399, 100000, 72333, 38710. Their distances,
according to <i>Kepler</i> and <i>Bullialdus</i>, scarcely differ by
any sensible quantity, and where they differ most the distances drawn
from the periodic times, fall in between them.</p>

<p>That the circum-terrestrial force likewise decreases in the duplicate
proportion of the distances, I infer thus.</p>

<p>The mean distance of the moon from the centre of the earth, is, in
semi-diameters of the earth, according to <i>Ptolemy</i>, <i>Kepler</i>
in his <i>Ephemerides</i>, <i>Bullialdus</i>, <i>Hevelius</i>, and
<i>Ricciolus</i>, 59; according to <i>Flamsted</i>, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="59\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/1283.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1283.svg">;</span>
according to <i>Tycho</i>, <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="56\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/967.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_967.svg_1">;</span> to <i>Vendelin</i>,

<img alt="" data-tex="62\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1284.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1284.svg"> (<a href="#Page_391" class="pginternal">p. 391</a>, <a href="#Page_392" class="pginternal">392</a>, <a href="#Page_393" class="pginternal">393</a>).</p>

<p>But <i>Tycho</i>, and all that follow his tables of refraction, making
the refractions of the sun and moon (altogether against the nature
of light) to exceed those of the fixed stars, and that by about four
or five minutes in the horizon, did thereby augment the horizontal
parallax of the moon by about the like number of minutes; that is, by
about the 12th or 15th part of the whole parallax. Correct this error,
and the distance will become 60 or 61 semi-diameters of the earth,
nearly agreeing with what others have determined.</p>

<p>Let us, then, assume the mean distance of the moon 60 semi-diameters of
the earth, and its periodic time in respect of the fixed stars 27<sup>d</sup>.
7<sup>h</sup>. 43', as astronomers have determined it. And (by Cor. VI, Prop. IV)
a body revolved in our air, near the surface of the earth supposed at
rest, by means of a centripetal force which should be to the same force
at the distance of the moon in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of
the distances from the centre of the earth, that is, as 3600 to 1,
would (secluding the resistance of the air) complete a revolution in
1<sup>h</sup>. 24' 27''.</p>

<p>Suppose the circumference of the earth to be 123249600 <i>Paris</i>
feet, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</span> has been determined by the late mensuration of the
<i>French</i> (vide <a href="#Page_406" class="pginternal">p. 406</a>); then the same body, deprived of
its circular motion, and falling by the impulse of the same
centripetal force as before, would, in one second of time, describe
<img alt="" data-tex="15\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/863.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_863.svg_2"> <i>Paris</i> feet.</p>

<p>This we infer by a calculus formed upon Prop. XXXVI, and it agrees with
what we observe in all bodies about the earth. For by the experiments
of pendulums, and a computation raised thereon, Mr. <i>Huygens</i> has
demonstrated that bodies falling by all that centripetal force with
which (of whatever nature it is) they are impelled near the surface
of the earth, do, in one second of time, describe <img alt="" data-tex="15\tfrac{1}{12}" src="images/969.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.858ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_969.svg_3">
<i>Paris</i> feet.</p>

<p>But if the earth is supposed to move, the earth and moon together (by
Cor. IV of the Laws of Motion, and Prop. LVII) will be revolved about
their common centre of gravity. And the moon (by Prop. LX) will in the
same periodic time, 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43', with the same circum-terrestrial
force diminished in the duplicate proportion of the distance, describe
an orbit whose semi-diameter is to the semi-diameter of the former
orbit, that is, to 60 semi-diameters of the earth, as the sum of both
the bodies of the earth and moon to the first of two mean proportionals
between this sum and the body of the earth; that is, if we suppose the
moon (on account of its mean apparent diameter <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="31\tfrac{1}{2}'" src="images/1285.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.686ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1285.svg">)</span>
to be about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{42}" src="images/1286.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1286.svg"> of the earth, as 43 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\sqrt[3]{42 + \overline{43}\vert^{2}}" src="images/1287.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.041ex; width: 11.215ex; height: 4.208ex;" id="img_images_1287.svg">,</span>
or as about 128 to 127. And therefore the semi-diameter of the orbit,
that is, the distance between the centres of the moon and earth,
will in this case be <img alt="" data-tex="60\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/968.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_968.svg_6"> semi-diameters of the earth,
almost the same with that assigned by <i>Copernicus</i>, which the
<i>Tychonic</i> observations by no means disprove; and, therefore, the
duplicate proportion of the decrement of the force holds good in this
distance. I have neglected the increment of the orbit which arises from
the action of the sun as inconsiderable; but if that is subducted, the
true distance will remain about <img alt="" data-tex="60\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/968.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_968.svg_7"> semi-diameters of
the earth.</p>

<p>But farther (<a href="#Page_390" class="pginternal">p. 390</a>); this proportion of the decrement of the forces
is confirmed from the eccentricity of the planets, and the very
slow motion of their apses; for (by the Corollaries of Prop. XLV)
in no other proportion could the circum-solar planets once in every
revolution descend to their least and once ascend to their greatest
distance from the sun, and the places of those distances remain
immoveable. A small error from the duplicate proportion would produce
a motion of the apses considerable in every revolution, but in many
enormous.</p>

<p>But now, after innumerable revolutions, hardly any such motion has been
perceived in the orbs of the circum-solar planets. Some astronomers
affirm that there is no such motion; others reckon it no greater than
what may easily arise from the causes hereafter to be assigned, and is
of no moment in the present question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</span></p>

<p>We may even neglect the motion of the moon's apsis (<a href="#Page_390" class="pginternal">p. 390</a>, <a href="#Page_391" class="pginternal">391</a>),
which is far greater than in the circum-solar planets, amounting
in every revolution to three degrees; and from this motion it is
demonstrable that the circum-terrestrial force decreases in no less
than the duplicate, but far less than the triplicate proportion of
the distance; for if the duplicate proportion was gradually changed
into the triplicate, the motion of the apsis would thereby increase to
infinity; and, therefore, by a very small mutation, would exceed the
motion of the moon's apsis. This slow motion arises from the action of
the circum-solar force, as we shall afterwards explain. But, secluding
this cause, the apsis or apogeon of the moon will be fixed, and the
duplicate proportion of the decrease of the circum-terrestrial force in
different distances from the earth will accurately take place.</p>

<p>Now that this proportion has been established, we may compare the
forces of the several planets among themselves (<a href="#Page_391" class="pginternal">p. 391</a>).</p>

<p>In the mean distance of Jupiter from the earth, the greatest elongation
of the outmost satellite from Jupiter's centre (by the observations
of Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>) is 8' 13''; and therefore the distance of the
satellite from the centre of Jupiter is to the mean distance of Jupiter
from the centre of the sun as 124 to 52012, but to the mean distance
of Venus from the centre of the sun as 124 to 7234; and their periodic
times are <img alt="" data-tex="16\tfrac{3}{4}^{d}" src="images/1288.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.077ex; height: 3.229ex;" id="img_images_1288.svg"> and <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="224\tfrac{2}{3}^{d}" src="images/1289.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 6.209ex; height: 3.265ex;" id="img_images_1289.svg">;</span> and from
hence (according to Cor. II, Prop. IV), dividing the distances by the
squares of the times, we infer that the force by which the satellite
is impelled towards Jupiter is to the force by which Venus is impelled
towards the sun as 442 to 143; and if we diminish the force by which
the satellite is impelled in the duplicate proportion of the distance
124 to 7234, we shall have the circum-jovial force in the distance
of Venus from the sun to the circum-solar force by which Venus is
impelled as <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{13}{100}" src="images/1290.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.395ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1290.svg"> to 143, or as 1 to 1100; wherefore at
equal distances the circum-solar force is 1100 times greater than the
circum-jovial.</p>

<p>And, by the like computation, from the periodic time of the satellite
of Saturn 15<sup>d</sup>. 22<sup>h</sup>. and its greatest elongation from Saturn, while
that planet is in its mean distance from us, 3' 20'', it follows that
the distance of this satellite from Saturn's centre is to the distance
of Venus from the sun as <img alt="" data-tex="92\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1291.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1291.svg"> to 7234; and from thence
that the absolute circum-solar force is 2360 times greater than the
absolute circum-saturnal.</p>

<p>From the regularity of the heliocentric and irregularity of the
geocentric motions of Venus, of Jupiter, and the other planets, it is
evident (by Cor. IV, Prop. III) that the circum-terrestrial force,
compared with the circum-solar, is very small.</p>

<p><i>Ricciolus</i> and <i>Vendelin</i> have severally tried to determine
the sun's parallax from the moon's dichotomies observed by the
telescope, and they agree that it does not exceed half a minute.</p>

<p><i>Kepler</i>, from <i>Tycho's</i> observations and his own, found the
parallax of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</span> Mars insensible, even in opposition to the sun, when that
parallax is something greater than the sun's.</p>

<p><i>Flamsted</i> attempted the same parallax with the micrometer in the
perigeon position of Mars, but never found it above 25''; and thence
concluded the sun's parallax at most 10''.</p>

<p>Whence it follows that the distance of the moon from the earth bears no
greater proportion to the distance of the earth from the sun than 29 to
10000; nor to the distance of Venus from the sun than 29 to 7233.</p>

<p>From which distances, together with the periodic times, by the method
above explained, it is easy to infer that the absolute circum-solar
force is greater than the absolute circum-terrestrial force at least
229400 times.</p>

<p>And though we were only certain, from the observations of
<i>Ricciolus</i> and <i>Vendelin</i>, that the sun's parallax was less
than half a minute, yet from this it will follow that the absolute
circum-solar force exceeds the absolute circum-terrestrial force 8500
times.</p>

<p>By the like computations I happened to discover an analogy, that is
observed between the forces and the bodies of the planets; but, before
I explain this analogy, the apparent diameters of the planets in their
mean distances from the earth must be first determined.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> (<a href="#Page_387" class="pginternal">p. 387</a>), by the micrometer, measured the diameter
of Jupiter 40'' or 41''; the diameter of Saturn's ring 50''; and the
diameter of the sun about 32' 13'' (<a href="#Page_387" class="pginternal">p. 387</a>).</p>

<p>But the diameter of Saturn is to the diameter of the ring, according
to Mr. <i>Huygens</i> and Dr. <i>Halley</i>, as 4 to 9; according to
<i>Galletius</i>, as 4 to 10; and according to <i>Hooke</i> (by a
telescope of 60 feet), as 5 to 12. And from the mean proportion, 5 to
12, the diameter of Saturn's body is inferred about 21''.</p>

<p>Such as we have said are the apparent magnitudes; but, because of the
unequal refrangibility of light, all lucid points are dilated by the
telescope, and in the focus of the object-glass possess a circular
space whose breadth is about the 50th part of the aperture of the glass.</p>

<p>It is true, that towards the circumference the light is so rare as
hardly to move the sense; but towards the middle, where it is of
greater density, and is sensible enough, it makes a small lucid circle,
whose breadth varies according to the splendor of the lucid point, but
is generally about the 3d, or 4th, or 5th part of the breadth of the
whole.</p>

<p>Let ABD represent the circle of the whole light; PQ the small
circle of the denser and clearer light; C the centre of both; CA,
CB, semi-diameters of the greater circle containing a right angle
at C; ACBE the square comprehended under these semi-diameters; AB
the diagonal of that square; EGH an hyperbola with the centre C and
asymptotes CA, CB; PG a perpendicular erected from any point P of
the line BC, and meeting the hyperbola in G, and the right lines AB,
AE, in K and F: and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</span> density of the light in any place P, will,
by my computation, be as the line FG, and therefore at the centre
infinite, but near the circumference very small. And the whole light
within the small circle PQ, is to the whole without as the area of the
quadrilateral figure CAKP to the triangle PKB. And we are to understand
the small circle PQ to be there terminated, where FG, the density of
the light, begins to be less than what is required to move the sense.</p>

<p>Hence it was, that, at the distance of 191382 feet, a fire of 3 feet in
diameter, through a telescope of 3 feet, appeared to Mr. <i>Picart</i>
of 8'' in breadth, when it should have appeared only of 3'' 14''';
and hence it is that the brighter fixed stars appear through the
telescope as of 5'' or 6'' in diameter, and that with a good full
light; but with a fainter light they appear to run out to a greater
breadth. Hence, likewise, it was that <i>Hevelius</i>, by diminishing
the aperture of the telescope, did cut off a great part of the light
towards the circumference, and brought the disk of the star to be more
distinctly defined, which, though hereby diminished, did yet appear as
of 5'' or 6'' in diameter. But Mr. <i>Huygens</i>, only by clouding
the eye-glass with a little smoke, did so effectually extinguish this
scattered light, that the fixed stars appeared as mere points, void of
all sensible breadth. Hence also it was that Mr. <i>Huygens</i>, from
the breadth of bodies interposed to intercept the whole light of the
planets, reckoned their diameters greater than others have measured
them by the micrometer; for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</span> scattered light, which could not be
seen before for the stronger light of the planet, when the planet is
hid, appears every way farther spread. Lastly, from hence it is that
the planets appear so small in the disk of the sun being lessened
by the dilated light. For to <i>Hevelius</i>, <i>Galletius</i>, and
Dr. <i>Halley</i>, Mercury did not seem to exceed 12'' or 15''; and
Venus appeared to Mr. <i>Crabtrie</i> only 1' 3''; to <i>Horrox</i>
but 1' 12''; though by the mensurations of <i>Hevelius</i> and
<i>Hugenius</i> without the sun's disk, it ought to have been seen
at least 1' 24''. Thus the apparent diameter of the moon, which in
1684, a few days both before and after the sun's eclipse, was measured
at the observatory of <i>Paris</i> 31' 30'', in the eclipse itself
did not seem to exceed 30' or 30' 05''; and therefore the diameters
of the planets are to be diminished when without the sun, and to be
augmented when within it, by some seconds. But the errors seem to be
less than usual in the mensurations that are made by the micrometer.
So from the diameter of the shadow, determined by the eclipses of
the satellites, Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> found that the semi-diameter of
Jupiter was to the greatest elongation of the outmost satellite as 1
to 24,903. Wherefore since that elongation is 8' 13'', the diameter
of Jupiter will be <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="39\tfrac{1}{2}''" src="images/1292.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1292.svg">;</span> and, rejecting the scattered
light, the diameter found by the micrometer 40'' or 41'' will be
reduced to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="39\tfrac{1}{2}''" src="images/1292.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 5.125ex; height: 3.016ex;" id="img_images_1292.svg_1">;</span> and the diameter of Saturn 21'' is
to be diminished by the like correction, and to be reckoned 20'', or
something less. But (if I am not mistaken) the diameter of the sun,
because of its stronger light, is to be diminished something more, and
to be reckoned about 32', or 32' 6''.</p>

<p>That bodies so different in magnitude should come so near to an analogy
with their forces, is not without some mystery (<a href="#Page_400" class="pginternal">p. 400</a>).</p>

<p>It may be that the remoter planets, for want of heat, have not those
metallic substances and ponderous minerals with which our earth
abounds; and that the bodies of Venus and Mercury, as they are more
exposed to the sun's heat, are also harder baked, and more compact.</p>

<p>For, from the experiment of the burning-glass, we see that the heat
increases with the density of light; and this density increases in the
reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance from the sun; from
whence the sun's heat in Mercury is proved to be sevenfold its heat in
our summer seasons. But with this heat our water boils; and those heavy
fluids, quicksilver and the spirit of vitriol, gently evaporate, as I
have tried by the thermometer; and therefore there can be no fluids in
Mercury but what are heavy, and able to bear a great heat, and from
which substances of great density may be nourished.</p>

<p>And why not, if God has placed different bodies at different distances
from the sun, so as the denser bodies always possess the nearer places,
and each body enjoys a degree of heat suitable to its condition, and
proper for its nourishment? From this consideration it will best appear
that the weights of all the planets are one to another as their forces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</span></p>

<p>But I should be glad the diameters of the planets were more accurately
measured; and that may be done, if a lamp, set at a great distance, is
made to shine through a circular hole, and both the hole and the light
of the lamp are so diminished that the spectrum may appear through
the telescope just like the planet, and may be defined by the same
measure: then the diameter of the hole will be to its distance from the
objective glass as the true diameter of the planet to its distance from
us. The light of the lamp may be diminished by the interposition either
of pieces of cloth, or of smoked glass.</p>

<p>Of kin to the analogy we have been describing, there is another
observed between the forces and the bodies attracted (<a href="#Page_395" class="pginternal">p. 395</a>, <a href="#Page_396" class="pginternal">396</a>,
<a href="#Page_397" class="pginternal">p. 397</a>). Since the action of the centripetal force upon the planets
decreases in the duplicate proportion of the distance, and the periodic
time increases in the sesquiplicate thereof, it is evident that the
actions of the centripetal force, and therefore the periodic times,
would be equal in equal planets at equal distances from the sun; and in
equal distances of unequal planets the total actions of the centripetal
force would be as the bodies of the planets; for if the actions were
not proportional to the bodies to be moved, they could not equally
retract these bodies from the tangents of their orbs in equal times:
nor could the motions of the satellites of Jupiter be so regular, if it
was not that the circum-solar force was equally exerted upon Jupiter
and all its satellites in proportion of their several weights. And
the same thing is to be said of Saturn in respect of its satellites,
and of our earth in respect of the moon, as appears from Cor. II and
III, Prop. LXV. And, therefore, at equal distances, the actions of
the centripetal force are equal upon all the planets in proportion of
their bodies, or of the quantities of matter in their several bodies;
and for the same reason must be the same upon all the particles of
the same size of which the planet is composed; for if the action was
greater upon some sort of particles than upon others than in proportion
to their quantity of matter, it would be also greater or less upon the
whole planets not in proportion to the quantity only, but likewise of
the sort of the matter more copiously found in one and more sparingly
in another.</p>

<p>In such bodies as are found on our earth of very different sorts, I
examined this analogy with great accuracy (<a href="#Page_343" class="pginternal">p. 343</a>, <a href="#Page_344" class="pginternal">344</a>).</p>

<p>If the action of the circum-terrestrial force is proportional to the
bodies to be moved, it will (by the Second Law of Motion) move them
with equal velocity in equal times, and will make all bodies let fall
to descend through equal spaces in equal times, and all bodies hung by
equal threads to vibrate in equal times. If the action of the force
was greater, the times would be less; if that was less, these would be
greater.</p>

<p>But it has been long ago observed by others, that (allowance being made
for the small resistance of the air) all bodies descend through equal
spaces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</span> in equal times; and, by the help of pendulums, that equality of
times may be distinguished to great exactness.</p>

<p>I tried the thing in gold, silver, lead, glass, sand, common salt wood,
water, and wheat. I provided two equal wooden boxes. I filled the one
with wood, and suspended an equal weight of gold (as exactly as I
could) in the centre of oscillation of the other. The boxes, hung by
equal threads of 11 feet, made a couple of pendulums perfectly equal in
weight and figure, and equally exposed to the resistance of the air:
and, placing the one by the other, I observed them to play together
forwards and backwards for a long while, with equal vibrations. And
therefore (by Cor. I and VI, Prop. XXIV, Book II) the quantity of
matter in the gold was to the quantity of matter in the wood as the
action of the motive force upon all the gold to the action of the same
upon all the wood; that is, as the weight of the one to the weight of
the other.</p>

<p>And by these experiments, in bodies of the same weight, could have
discovered a difference of matter less than the thousandth part of the
whole.</p>

<p>Since the action of the centripetal force upon the bodies attracted is,
at equal distances, proportional to the quantities of matter in those
bodies, reason requires that it should be also proportional to the
quantity of matter in the body attracting.</p>

<p>For all action is mutual, and (<a href="#Page_83" class="pginternal">p. 83</a>, <a href="#Page_93" class="pginternal">93</a>, by the Third Law of Motion)
makes the bodies mutually to approach one to the other, and therefore
must be the same in both bodies. It is true that we may consider one
body as attracting, another as attracted; but this distinction is more
mathematical than natural. The attraction is really common of either to
other, and therefore of the same kind in both.</p>

<p>And hence it is that the attractive force is found in both. The
sun attracts Jupiter and the other planets; Jupiter attracts its
satellites; and, for the same reason, the satellites act as well one
upon another as upon Jupiter, and all the planets mutually one upon
another.</p>

<p>And though the mutual actions of two planets may be distinguished and
considered as two, by which each attracts the other, yet, as those
actions are intermediate, they do not make two but one operation
between two terms. Two bodies may be mutually attracted each to the
other by the contraction of a cord interposed. There is a double cause
of action, to wit, the disposition of both bodies, as well as a double
action in so far as the action is considered as upon two bodies; but as
betwixt two bodies it is but one single one. It is not one action by
which the sun attracts Jupiter, and another by which Jupiter attracts
the sun; but it is one action by which the sun and Jupiter mutually
endeavour to approach each the other. By the action with which the
sun attracts Jupiter, Jupiter and the sun endeavours to come nearer
together (by the Third Law of Motion); and by the action with which
Jupiter attracts the sun, likewise Jupiter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</span> and the sun endeavor to
come nearer together. But the sun is not attracted towards Jupiter by
a twofold action, nor Jupiter by a twofold action towards the sun; but
it is one single intermediate action, by which both approach nearer
together.</p>

<p>Thus iron draws the load-stone (<a href="#Page_93" class="pginternal">p. 93</a>), as well as the load-stone draws
the iron; for all iron in the neighbourhood of the load-stone draws
other iron. But the action betwixt the load-stone and iron is single,
and is considered as single by the philosophers. The action of iron
upon the load-stone, is, indeed, the action of the load-stone betwixt
itself and the iron, by which both endeavour to come nearer together:
and so it manifestly appears; for if you remove the load-stone, the
whole force of the iron almost ceases.</p>

<p>In this sense it is that we are to conceive one single action to be
exerted betwixt two planets, arising from the conspiring natures of
both: and this action standing in the same relation to both, if it is
proportional to the quantity of matter in the one, it will be also
proportional to the quantity of matter in the other.</p>

<figure class="figcenter width500" style="width: 500px;" id="i_527">
<img alt="That the forces of small bodies are insensible." height="443" src="images/i_527.jpg" width="500" id="img_images_i_527.jpg"></figure>

<p>Perhaps it may be objected, that, according to this philosophy (<a href="#Page_398" class="pginternal">p. 398</a>),
all bodies should mutually attract one another, contrary to the
evidence of experiments in terrestrial bodies; but I answer, that
the experiments in terrestrial bodies come to no account; for the
attraction of homogeneous spheres near their surfaces are (by Prop.
LXXII) as their diameters. Whence a sphere of one foot in diameter, and
of a like nature to the earth, would attract a small body placed near
its surface with a force 20000000 times less than the earth would do if
placed near its surface; but so small a force could produce no sensible
effect. If two such spheres were distant but by <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/228.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_228.svg_12"> of
an inch, they would not, even in spaces void of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</span> resistance, come
together by the force of their mutual attraction in less than a month's
time; and less spheres will come together at a rate yet slower,
viz., in the proportion of their diameters. Nay, whole mountains
will not be sufficient to produce any sensible effect. A mountain of
an hemispherical figure, three miles high, and six broad, will not,
by its attraction, draw the pendulum two minutes out of the true
perpendicular; and it is only in the great bodies of the planets that
these forces are to be perceived, unless we may reason about smaller
bodies in manner following.</p>

<p>Let ABCD (<a href="#Page_93" class="pginternal">p. 93</a>) represent the globe of the earth cut by any plane
AC into two parts ACB, and ACD. The part ACB bearing upon the part
ACD presses it with its whole weight; nor can the part ACD sustain
this pressure and continue unmoved, if it is not opposed by an equal
contrary pressure. And therefore the parts equally press each other by
their weights, that is, equally attract each other, according to the
third Law of Motion; and, if separated and let go, would fall towards
each other with velocities reciprocally as the bodies. All which we may
try and see in the load-stone, whose attracted part does not propel the
part attracting, but is only stopped and sustained thereby.</p>

<p>Suppose now that ACB represents some small body on the earth's surface;
then, because the mutual attractions of this particle, and of the
remaining part ACD of the earth towards each other, are equal, but
the attraction of the particle towards the earth (or its weight) is
as the matter of the particle (as we have proved by the experiment of
the pendulums), the attraction of the earth towards the particle will
likewise be as the matter of the particle; and therefore the attractive
forces of all terrestrial bodies will be as their several quantities of
matter.</p>

<p>The forces (<a href="#Page_396" class="pginternal">p. 396</a>), which are as the matter in terrestrial bodies of
all forms, and therefore are not mutable with the forms, must be found
in all sorts of bodies whatsoever, celestial as well as terrestrial,
and be in all proportional to their quantities of matter, because
among all there is no difference of substance, but of modes and forms
only. But in the celestial bodies the same thing is likewise proved
thus. We have shewn that the action of the circum-solar force upon
all the planets (reduced to equal distances) is as the matter of the
planets; that the action of the circumjovial force upon the satellites
of Jupiter observes the same law; and the same thing is to be said of
the attraction of all the planets towards every planet: but thence
it follows (by Prop. LXIX) that their attractive forces are as their
several quantities of matter.</p>

<p>As the parts of the earth mutually attract one another, so do those of
all the planets. If Jupiter and its satellites were brought together,
and formed into one globe, without doubt they would continue mutually
to attract one another as before. And, on the other hand, if the
body of Jupiter was broke into more globes, to be sure, these would
no less attract<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</span> one another than they do the satellites now. From
these attractions it is that the bodies of the earth and all the
planets effect a spherical figure, and their parts cohere, and are
not dispersed through the æther. But we have before proved that these
forces arise from the universal nature of matter (<a href="#Page_398" class="pginternal">p. 398</a>), and that,
therefore, the force of any whole globe is made up of the several
forces of all its parts. And from thence it follows (by Cor. III, Prop.
LXXIV) that the force of every particle decreases in the duplicate
proportion of the distance from that particle; and (by Prop. LXXIII and
LXXV) that the force of an entire globe, reckoning from the surface
outwards, decreases in the duplicate, but, reckoning inwards, in the
simple proportion of the distances from the centres, if the matter of
the globe be uniform. And though the matter of the globe, reckoning
from the centre towards the surface, is not uniform (<a href="#Page_398" class="pginternal">p. 398</a>, <a href="#Page_399" class="pginternal">399</a>),
yet the decrease in the duplicate proportion of the distance outwards
would (by Prop. LXXVI) take place, provided that difformity is similar
in places round about at equal distances from the centre. And two such
globes will (by the same Proposition) attract one the other with a
force decreasing in the duplicate proportion of the distance between
their centres.</p>

<p>Wherefore the absolute force of every globe is as the quantity of
matter which the globe contains; but the motive force by which every
globe is attracted towards another, and which, in terrestrial bodies,
we commonly call their weight, is as the content under the quantities
of matter in both globes applied to the square of the distance between
their centres (by Cor. IV, Prop. LXXVI), to which force the quantity
of motion, by which each globe in a given time will be carried towards
the other, is proportional. And the accelerative force, by which every
globe according to its quantity of matter is attracted towards another,
is as the quantity of matter in that other globe applied to the square
of the distance between the centres of the two (by Cor. II, Prop.
LXXVI); to which force, the velocity by which the attracted globe will,
in a given time, be carried towards the other is proportional. And from
these principles well understood, it will be now easy to determine the
motions of the celestial bodies among themselves.</p>

<p>From comparing the forces of the planets one with another, we have
above seen that the circum-solar does more than a thousand times
exceed all the rest; but by the action of a force so great it is
unavoidable but that all bodies within, nay, and far beyond, the bounds
of the planetary system must descend directly to the sun, unless
by other motions they are impelled towards other parts: nor is our
earth to be excluded from the number of such bodies; for certainly
the moon is a body of the same nature with the planets, and subject
to the same attractions with the other planets, seeing it is by the
circum-terrestrial force that it is retained in its orbit. But that the
earth and moon are equally attracted towards the sun, we have above
proved; we have likewise before proved that all bodies are subject to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</span>
the said common laws of attraction. Nay, supposing any of those bodies
to be deprived of its circular motion about the sun, by having its
distance from the sun, we may find (by Prop. XXXVI) in what space of
time it would in its descent arrive at the sun; to wit, in half that
periodic time in which the body might be revolved at one half of its
former distance; or in a space of time that is to the periodic time of
the planet as 1 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="4\sqrt{2}" src="images/1293.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.225ex; width: 4.192ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_1293.svg">;</span> as that Venus in its descent would
arrive at the sun in the space of 40 days, Jupiter in the space of two
years and one month, and the earth and moon together in the space of
66 days and 19 hours. But, since no such thing happens, it must needs
be, that those bodies are moved towards other parts (<a href="#Page_75" class="pginternal">p. 75</a>), nor is
every motion sufficient for this purpose. To hinder such a descent, a
due proportion of velocity is required. And hence depends the force
of the argument drawn from the retardation of the motions of the
planets. Unless the circum-solar force decreased in the duplicate ratio
of their increasing slowness, the excess thereof would force those
bodies to descend to the sun; for instance, if the motion (<i>cæteris
paribus</i>) was retarded by one half, the planet would be retained
in its orb by one fourth of the former circum-solar force, and by
the excess of the other three fourths would descend to the sun. And
therefore the planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury) are
not really retarded in their perigees, nor become really stationary,
or regressive with slow motions. All these are but apparent, and the
absolute motions, by which the planets continue to revolve in their
orbits, are always direct, and nearly equable. But that such motions
are performed about the sun, we have already proved; and therefore
the sun, as the centre of the absolute motions, is quiescent. For
we can by no means allow quiescence to the earth, lest the planets
in their perigees should indeed be truly retarded, and become truly
stationary and regressive, and so for want of motion should descend
to the sun. But farther; since the planets (Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
and the rest) by radii drawn to the sun describe regular orbits, and
areas (as we have shewn) nearly and to sense proportional to the
times, it follows (by Prop. III, and Cor. III, Prop. LXV) that the sun
is moved with no notable force, unless perhaps with such as all the
planets are equally moved with, according to their several quantities
of matter, in parallel lines, and so the whole system is transferred
in right lines. Reject that translation of the whole system, and the
sun will be almost quiescent in the centre thereof. If the sun was
revolved about the earth, and carried the other planets round about
itself, the earth ought to attract the sun with a great force, but
the circum-solar planets with no force producing any sensible effect,
which is contrary to Cor. III, Prop. LXV. Add to this, that if hitherto
the earth, because of the gravitation of its parts, has been placed
by most authors in the lowermost region of the universe; now, for
better reason, the sun possessed of a centripetal force exceeding
our terrestrial gravitation a thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</span> times and more, ought to be
depressed into the lowermost place, and to be held for the centre of
the system. And thus the true disposition of the whole system will be
more fully and more exactly understood.</p>

<p>Because the fixed stars are quiescent one in respect of another
(<a href="#Page_401" class="pginternal">p. 401</a>, <a href="#Page_402" class="pginternal">402</a>), we may consider the sun, earth, and planets, as one
system of bodies carried hither and thither by various motions among
themselves; and the common centre of gravity of all (by Cor. IV of the
Laws of Motion) will either be quiescent, or move uniformly forward
in a right line: in which case the whole system will likewise move
uniformly forward in right lines. But this is an hypothesis hardly to
be admitted; and, therefore, setting it aside, that common centre will
be quiescent: and from it the sun is never far removed. The common
centre of gravity of the sun and Jupiter falls on the surface of the
sun; and though all the planets were placed towards the same parts from
the sun with Jupiter the common centre of the sun and all of them would
scarcely recede twice as far from the sun's centre; and, therefore,
though the sun, according to the various situation of the planets, is
variously agitated, and always wandering to and fro with a slow motion
of libration, yet it never recedes one entire diameter of its own body
from the quiescent centre of the whole system. But from the weights of
the sun and planets above determined, and the situation of all among
themselves, their common centre of gravity may be found; and, this
being given, the sun's place to any supposed time may be obtained.</p>

<p>About the sun thus librated the other planets are revolved in elliptic
orbits (<a href="#Page_403" class="pginternal">p. 403</a>), and, by radii drawn to the sun, describe areas nearly
proportional to the times, as is explained in Prop. LXV. If the sun was
quiescent, and the other planets did not act mutually one upon another,
their orbits would be elliptic, and the areas exactly proportional to
the times (by Prop. XI, and Cor. 1, Prop. XIII). But the actions of the
planets among themselves, compared with the actions of the sun on the
planets, are of no moment, and produce no sensible errors. And those
errors are less in revolutions about the sun agitated in the manner
but now described than if those revolutions were made about the sun
quiescent (by Prop. LXVI, and Cor. Prop. LXVIII), especially if the
focus of every orbit is placed in the common centre of gravity of all
the lower included planets; viz., the focus of the orbit of Mercury in
the centre of the sun; the focus of the orbit of Venus in the common
centre of gravity of Mercury and the sun; the focus of the orbit of the
earth in the common centre of gravity of Venus, Mercury, and the sun;
and so of the rest. And by this means the foci of the orbits of all the
planets, except Saturn, will not be sensibly removed from the centre
of the sun, nor will the focus of the orbit of Saturn recede sensibly
from the common centre of gravity of Jupiter and the sun. And therefore
astronomers are not far from the truth, when they reckon the sun's
centre the common focus of all the planetary orbits. In Saturn itself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</span>
the error thence arising does not exceed 1' 45''. And if its orbit, by
placing the focus thereof in the common centre of gravity of Jupiter
and the sun, shall happen to agree better with the phænomena, from
thence all that we have said will be farther confirmed.</p>

<p>If the sun was quiescent, and the planets did not act one on another,
the aphelions and nodes of their orbits would likewise (by Prop. 1,
XI, and Cor. Prop. XIII) be quiescent. And the longer axes of their
elliptic orbits would (by Prop. XV) be as the cubic roots of the
squares of their periodic times: and therefore from the given periodic
times would be also given. But those times are to be measured not
from the equinoctial points, which are moveable, but from the first
star of Aries. Put the semi-axis of the earth's orbit 100000, and the
semi-axes of the orbits of Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury,
from their periodic times, will come out 953806, 520116, 152399,
72333, 38710 respectively. But from the sun's motion every semi-axis
is increased (by Prop. LX) by about one third of the distance of the
sun's centre from the common centre of gravity of the sun and planet
(<a href="#Page_405" class="pginternal">p. 405</a>, <a href="#Page_406" class="pginternal">406</a>.) And from the actions of the exterior planets on the
interior, the periodic times of the interior are something protracted,
though scarcely by any sensible quantity; and their aphelions are
transferred (by Cor. VI and VII, Prop. LXVI) by very slow motions in
<i>consequentia</i>. And on the like account the periodic times of
all, especially of the exterior planets, will be prolonged by the
actions of the comets, if any such there are, without the orb of
Saturn, and the aphelions of all will be thereby carried forwards
in <i>consequentia</i>. But from the progress of the aphelions the
regress of the nodes follows (by Cor. XI, XIII, Prop. LXVI). And if
the plane of the ecliptic is quiescent, the regress of the nodes (by
Cor. XVI, Prop. LXVI) will be to the progress of the aphelion in every
orbit as the regress of the nodes of the moon's orbit to the progress
of its apogeon nearly, that is, as about 10 to 21. But astronomical
observations seem to confirm a very slow progress of the aphelions,
and a regress of the nodes in respect of the fixed stars. And hence
it is probable that there are comets in the regions beyond the
planets, which, revolving in very eccentric orbs, quickly fly through
their perihelion parts, and, by an exceedingly slow motion in their
aphelions, spend almost their whole time in the regions beyond the
planets; as we shall afterwards explain more at large.</p>

<p>The planets thus revolved about the sun (<a href="#Page_413" class="pginternal">p. 413</a>, <a href="#Page_414" class="pginternal">414</a>, <a href="#Page_415" class="pginternal">415</a>) may at
the same time carry others revolving about themselves as satellites
or moons, as appears by Prop. LXVI. But from the action of the sun
our moon must move with greater velocity, and, by a radius drawn to
the earth, describe an area greater for the time; it must have its
orbit less curve, and therefore approach nearer to the earth in the
syzygies than in the quadratures, except in so far as the motion of
eccentricity hinders those effects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</span> For the eccentricity is greatest
when the moon's apogeon is in the syzygies, and least when the same is
in the quadratures; and hence it is that the perigeon moon is swifter
and nearer to us, but the apogeon moon slower and farther from us, in
the syzygies than in the quadratures. But farther; the apogeon has a
progressive and the nodes a regressive motion, both unequable. For
the apogeon is more swiftly progressive in its syzygies, more slowly
regressive in its quadratures, and by the excess of its progress above
its regress is yearly transferred in <i>consequentia</i>; but the
nodes are quiescent in their syzygies, and most swiftly regressive in
their quadratures. But farther, still, the greatest latitude of the
moon is greater in its quadratures than in its syzygies; and the mean
motion swifter in the aphelion of the earth than in its perihelion.
More inequalities in the moon's motion have not hitherto been taken
notice of by astronomers: but all these follow from our principles
in Cor. II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, Prop.
LXVI, and are known really to exist in the heavens. And this may
seen in that most ingenious, and if I mistake not, of all, the most
accurate, hypothesis of Mr. <i>Horrox</i>, which Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>
has fitted to the heavens; but the astronomical hypotheses are to be
corrected in the motion of the nodes; for the nodes admit the greatest
equation or prosthaphæresis in their octants, and this inequality is
most conspicuous when the moon is in the nodes, and therefore also
in the octants; and hence it was that <i>Tycho</i>, and others after
him, referred this inequality to the octants of the moon, and made it
menstrual; but the reasons by us adduced prove that it ought to be
referred to the octants of the nodes, and to be made annual.</p>

<p>Beside those inequalities taken notice of by astronomers (<a href="#Page_414" class="pginternal">p. 414</a>,
<a href="#Page_445" class="pginternal">445</a>, <a href="#Page_447" class="pginternal">447</a>,) there are yet some others, by which the moon's motions are
so disturbed, that hitherto by no law could they be reduced to any
certain regulation. For the velocities or horary motions of the apogee
and nodes of the moon, and their equations, as well as the difference
betwixt the greatest eccentricity in the syzygies and the least in the
quadratures, and that inequality which we call the variation, in the
progress of the year are augmented and diminished (by Cor. XIV, Prop.
LXVI) in the triplicate ratio of the sun's apparent diameter. Beside
that, the variation is mutable nearly in the duplicate ratio of the
time between the quadratures (by Cor. I and II, Lem. X, and Cor. XVI,
Prop. LXVI); and all those inequalities are something greater in that
part of the orbit which respects the sun than in the opposite part, but
by a difference that is scarcely or not at all perceptible.</p>

<p>By a computation (<a href="#Page_422" class="pginternal">p. 412</a>), which for brevity's sake I do not describe,
I also find that the area which the moon by a radius drawn to the earth
describes in the several equal moments of time is nearly as the sum of
the number <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="237\tfrac{3}{10}" src="images/1294.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.989ex; height: 2.771ex;" id="img_images_1294.svg">,</span> and versed sine of the double distance
of the moon from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</span> the nearest quadrature in a circle whose radius is
unity; and therefore that the square of the moon's distance from the
earth is as that sum divided by the horary motion of the moon. Thus it
is when the variation in the octants is in its mean quantity; but if
the variation is greater or less, that versed sine must be augmented
or diminished in the same ratio. Let astronomers try how exactly the
distances thus found will agree with the moon's apparent diameters.</p>

<p>From the motions of our moon we may derive the motions of the moons
or satellites of Jupiter and Saturn (<a href="#Page_413" class="pginternal">p. 413</a>); for the mean motion of
the nodes of the outmost satellite of Jupiter is to the mean motion
of the nodes of our moon in a proportion compounded of the duplicate
proportion of the periodic time of the earth about the sun to the
periodic time of Jupiter about the sun, and the simple proportion of
the periodic time of the satellite about Jupiter to the periodic time
of our moon about the earth (by Cor. XVI, Prop. LXVI): and therefore
those nodes, in the space of a hundred years, are carried 8° 24'
backwards, or in <i>antecedentia</i>. The mean motions of the nodes of
the inner satellites are to the (mean) motion of (the nodes of) the
outmost as their periodic times to the periodic time of this, by the
same corollary, and are thence given. And the motion of the apsis of
every satellite in <i>consequentia</i> is to the motion of its nodes
in <i>antecedentia</i>, as the motion of the apogee of our moon to the
motion of its nodes (by the same Corollary), and is thence given. The
greatest equations of the nodes and line of the apses of each satellite
are to the greatest equations of the nodes and the line of the apses of
the moon respectively as the motion of the nodes and line of the apses
of the satellites in the time of one revolution of the first equations
to the motion of the nodes and apogeon of the moon in the time of one
revolution of the last equations. The variation of a satellite seen
from Jupiter is to the variation of our moon in the same proportion
as the whole motions of their nodes respectively, during the times in
which the satellite and our moon (after parting from) are revolved
(again) to the sun, by the same Corollary; and therefore in the outmost
satellite the variation does not exceed 5'' 12'''. From the small
quantity of those inequalities, and the slowness of the motions, it
happens that the motions of the satellites are found to be so regular,
that the more modern astronomers either deny all motion to the nodes,
or affirm them to be very slowly regressive.</p>

<p>(<a href="#Page_404" class="pginternal">P. 404</a>). While the planets are thus revolved in orbits about remote
centres, in the mean time they make their several rotations about
their proper axes; the sun in 26 days; Jupiter in 9<sup>h</sup>. 56'; Mars in
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="24\tfrac{2}{3}^{h}." src="images/1295.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 5.796ex; height: 3.265ex;" id="img_images_1295.svg">;</span> Venus in 23<sup>h</sup>.; and that in planes not much
inclined to the plane of the ecliptic, and according to the order of
the signs, as astronomers determine from the spots or maculæ that by
turns present themselves to our sight in their bodies; and there is a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</span>like revolution of our earth performed in 24<sup>h</sup>.; and those motions
are neither accelerated nor retarded by the actions of the centripetal
forces, as appears by Cor. XXII, Prop. LXVI; and therefore of all
others they are the most equable and most fit for the mensuration of
time; but those revolutions are to be reckoned equable not from their
return to the sun, but to some fixed star: for as the position of
the planets to the sun is unequably varied, the revolutions of those
planets from sun to sun are rendered unequable.</p>

<p>In like manner is the moon revolved about its axis by a motion most
equable in respect of the fixed stars, viz., in 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43', that
is, in the space of a sidereal month; so that this diurnal motion is
equal to the mean motion of the moon in its orbit; upon which account
the same face of the moon always respects the centre about which this
mean motion is performed, that is, the exterior focus of the moon's
orbit nearly; and hence arises a deflection of the moon's face from
the earth, sometimes towards the east, and other times towards the
west, according to the position of the focus which it respects; and
this deflection is equal to the equation of the moon's orbit, or to the
difference betwixt its mean and true motions; and this is the moon's
libration in longitude: but it is likewise affected with a libration in
latitude arising from the inclination of the moon's axis to the plane
of the orbit in which the moon is revolved about the earth; for that
axis retains the same position to the fixed stars nearly, and hence the
poles present themselves to our view by turns, as we may understand
from the example of the motion of the earth, whose poles, by reason
of the inclination of its axis to the plane of the ecliptic, are by
turns illuminated by the sun. To determine exactly the position of the
moon's axis to the fixed stars, and the variation of this position, is
a problem worthy of an astronomer.</p>

<p>By reason of the diurnal revolutions of the planets, the matter which
they contain endeavours to recede from the axis of this motion; and
hence the fluid parts rising higher towards the equator than about
the poles (<a href="#Page_405" class="pginternal">p. 405</a>), would lay the solid parts about the equator under
water, if those parts did not rise also (<a href="#Page_405" class="pginternal">p. 405</a>, <a href="#Page_409" class="pginternal">409</a>): upon which
account the planets are something thicker about the equator than
about the poles; and their equinoctial points (<a href="#Page_413" class="pginternal">p. 413</a>) thence become
regressive; and their axes, by a motion of nutation, twice in every
revolution, librate towards their ecliptics, and twice return again to
their former inclination, as is explained in Cor. XVIII, Prop. LXVI;
and hence it is that Jupiter, viewed through very long telescopes, does
not appear altogether round (<a href="#Page_409" class="pginternal">p. 409</a>), but having its diameter that lies
parallel to the ecliptic something longer than that which is drawn from
north to south.</p>

<p>And from the diurnal motion and the attractions (<a href="#Page_415" class="pginternal">p. 415</a>, <a href="#Page_418" class="pginternal">418</a>) of the
sun and moon our sea ought twice to rise and twice to fall every day,
as well lunar as solar (by Cor. XIX, XX, Prop. LXVI), and the greatest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</span>
height of the water to happen before the sixth hour of either day
and after the twelfth hour preceding. By the slowness of the diurnal
motion the flood is retracted to the twelfth hour; and by the force
of the motion of reciprocation it is protracted and deferred till a
time nearer to the sixth hour. But till that time is more certainly
determined by the phænomena, choosing the middle between those
extremes, why may we not conjecture the greatest height of the water to
happen at the third hour? for thus the water will rise all that time in
which the force of the luminaries to raise it is greater, and will fall
all that time in which their force is less; viz., from the ninth to the
third hour when that force is greater, and from the third to the ninth
when it is less. The hours I reckon from the appulse of each luminary
to the meridian of the place, as well under as above the horizon; and
by the hours of the lunar day I understand the twenty-fourth parts of
that time which the moon spends before it comes about again by its
apparent diurnal motion to the meridian of the place which it left the
day before.</p>

<p>But the two motions which the two luminaries raise will not appear
distinguished, but will make a certain mixed motion. In the conjunction
or opposition of the luminaries their forces will be conjoined, and
bring on the greatest flood and ebb. In the quadratures the sun will
raise the waters which the moon depresseth, and depress the waters
which the moon raiseth; and from the difference of their forces the
smallest of all tides will follow. And because (as experience tells us)
the force of the moon is greater than that of the sun, the greatest
height of the water will happen about the third lunar hour. Out of the
syzygies and quadratures the greatest tide which by the single force of
the moon ought to fall out at the third lunar hour, and by the single
force of the sun at the third solar hour, by the compounded forces of
both must fall out in an intermediate time that approaches nearer to
the third hour of the moon than to that of the sun; and, therefore,
while the moon is passing from the syzygies to the quadratures, during
which time the third hour of the sun precedes the third of the moon,
the greatest tide will precede the third lunar hour, and that by the
greatest interval a little after the octants of the moon; and by like
intervals the greatest tide will follow the third lunar hour, while the
moon is passing from the quadratures to the syzygies.</p>

<p>But the effects of the luminaries depend upon their distances from the
earth; for when they are less distant their effects are greater, and
when more distant their effects are less, and that in the triplicate
proportion of their apparent diameters. Therefore it is that the sun
in the winter time, being then in its perigee, has a greater effect,
and makes the tides in the syzygies something greater, and those in
the quadratures something less, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, than in the
summer season; and every month the moon, while in the perigee, raiseth
greater tides than at the distance of 15 days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</span> before or after, when it
is in its apogee. Whence it comes to pass that two highest tides do not
follow one the other in two immediately succeeding syzygies.</p>

<p>The effect of either luminary doth likewise depend upon its declination
or distance from the equator; for if the luminary was placed at
the pole, it would constantly attract all the parts of the waters,
without any intension or remission of its action, and could cause no
reciprocation of motion; and, therefore, as the luminaries decline from
the equator towards either pole, they will by degrees lose their force,
and on this account will excite lesser tides in the solstitial than
in the equinoctial syzygies. But in the solstitial quadratures they
will raise greater tides than in the quadratures about the equinoxes;
because the effect of the moon, then situated in the equator, most
exceeds the effect of the sun; therefore the greatest tides fall out
in those syzygies, and the least in those quadratures, which happen
about the time of both equinoxes; and the greatest tide in the syzygies
is always succeeded by the least tide in the quadratures, as we find
by experience. But because the sun is less distant from the earth in
winter than in summer, it comes to pass that the greatest and least
tides more frequently appear before than after the vernal equinox, and
more frequently after than before the autumnal.</p>

<figure class="figright width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_537">
<img alt="That out of the equator the tides are greater and less alternately." height="138" src="images/i_537.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_537.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Moreover, the effects of the luminaries depend upon the latitudes of
places. Let A<i>p</i>EP represent the earth on all sides covered with
deep waters; C its centre; P, <i>p</i>, its poles; AE the equator; F
any place without the equator; F<i>f</i> the parallel of the place;
D<i>d</i> the correspondent parallel on the other side of the equator;
L the place which the moon possessed three hours before; H the place of
the earth directly under it; <i>h</i> the opposite place; K, <i>k</i>,
the places at 90 degrees distance; CH, C<i>h</i>, the greatest heights
of the sea from the centre of the earth; and CK, C<i>k</i>, the least
heights; and if with the axes H<i>h</i>, K<i>k</i>, an ellipsis is
described, and by the revolution of that ellipsis about its longer axis
H<i>h</i> a spheroid HPK<i>hpk</i> is formed, this spheroid will nearly
represent the figure of the sea; and CF, C<i>f</i>, CD, C<i>d</i>, will
represent the sea in the places F, <i>f</i>, D, <i>d</i>. But farther;
if in the said revolution of the ellipsis any point N describes the
circle NM, cutting the parallels F<i>f</i>, D<i>d</i>, in any places
R, T, and the equator AE in S, CN will represent the height of the sea
in all those places R, S, T, situated in this circle. Wherefore in the
diurnal revolution of any place F the greatest flood will be in F, at
the third hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian above the
horizon; and afterwards the greatest ebb in Q, at the third hour after
the setting of the moon; and then the greatest flood in <i>f</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</span> at
the third hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian under
the horizon, and, lastly, the greatest ebb in Q, at the third hour
after the rising of the moon; and the latter flood in <i>f</i> will be
less than the preceding flood in F. For the whole sea is divided into
two huge and hemispherical floods, one in the hemisphere KH<i>k</i>C
on the north side, the other in the opposite hemisphere KH<i>k</i>C,
which we may therefore call the northern and the southern floods: these
floods being always opposite the one to the other, come by turns to
the meridians of all places after the interval of twelve lunar hours;
and, seeing the northern countries partake more of the northern flood,
and the southern countries more of the southern flood, thence arise
tides alternately greater and less in all places without the equator
in which the luminaries rise and set. But the greater tide will happen
when the moon declines towards the vertex of the place, about the third
hour after the appulse of the moon to the meridian above the horizon;
and when the moon changes its declination, that which was the greater
tide will be changed into a lesser; and the greatest difference of
the floods will fall out about the times of the solstices, especially
if the ascending node of the moon is about the first of Aries. So the
morning tides in winter exceed those of the evening, and the evening
tides exceed those of the morning in summer; at <i>Plymouth</i> by the
height of one foot, but at <i>Bristol</i> by the height of 15 inches,
according to the observations of <i>Colepress</i> and <i>Sturmy</i>.</p>

<p>But the motions which we have been describing suffer some alteration
from that force of reciprocation which the waters [having once received]
retain a little while by their <i>vis insita</i>; whence it comes to pass that the
tides may continue for some time, though the actions of the luminaries
should cease. This power of retaining the impressed motion lessens the
difference of the alternate tides, and makes those tides which immediately
succeed after the syzygies greater, and those which follow next after the
quadratures less. And hence it is that the alternate tides at <i>Plymouth</i>
and <i>Bristol</i> do not differ much more one from the other than by the height
of a foot, or of 15 inches; and that the greatest tides of all at those ports
are not the first but the third after the syzygies.</p>

<p>And, besides, all the motions are retarded in their passage through
shallow channels, so that the greatest tides of all, in some straits
and mouths of rivers, are the fourth, or even the fifth, after the
syzygies.</p>

<p>It may also happen that the greatest tide may be the fourth or fifth
after the syzygies, or fall out yet later, because the motions of the
sea are retarded in passing through shallow places towards the shores;
for so the tide arrives at the western coast of <i>Ireland</i> at the
third lunar hour, and an hour or two after at the ports in the southern
coast of the same island; as also at the islands <i>Cassiterides</i>,
commonly <i>Sorlings</i>; then successively at <i>Falmouth</i>,
<i>Plymouth</i>, <i>Portland</i>, the isle of <i>Wight</i>,
<i>Winchester</i>, <i>Dover</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</span> the mouth of the <i>Thames</i>,
and <i>London Bridge</i>, spending twelve hours in this passage. But
farther; the propagation of the tides may be obstructed even by the
channels of the ocean itself, when they are not of depth enough,
for the flood happens at the third lunar hour in the <i>Canary</i>
islands; and at all those western coasts that lie towards the Atlantic
ocean, as of <i>Ireland</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and all
<i>Africa</i>, to the <i>Cape</i> of <i>Good Hope</i>, except in some
shallow places, where it is impeded, and falls out later; and in the
straits of <i>Gibraltar</i>, where, by reason of a motion propagated
from the Mediterranean sea, it flows sooner. But, passing from those
coasts over the breadth of the ocean to the coasts of <i>America</i>,
the flood arrives first at the most eastern shores of <i>Brazil</i>,
about the fourth or fifth lunar hour; then at the mouth of the river of
the <i>Amazons</i> at the sixth hour, but at the neighbouring islands
at the fourth hour; afterwards at the islands of <i>Bermudas</i> at
the seventh hour, and at port St. <i>Augustin</i> in <i>Florida</i>
at seven and a half. And therefore the tide is propagated through the
ocean with a slower motion than it should be according to the course
of the moon; and this retardation is very necessary, that the sea at
the same time may fall between <i>Brazil</i> and <i>New France</i>, and
rise at the <i>Canary</i> islands, and on the coasts of <i>Europe</i>
and <i>Africa</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>: for the sea cannot rise
in one place but by falling in another. And it is probable that the
<i>Pacific</i> sea is agitated by the same laws; for in the coasts of
<i>Chili</i> and <i>Peru</i> the highest flood is said to happen at the
third lunar hour. But with what velocity it is thence propagated to the
eastern coasts of <i>Japan</i>, the <i>Philippine</i> and other islands
adjacent to <i>China</i>, I have not yet learned.</p>

<p>Farther; it may happen (<a href="#Page_418" class="pginternal">p. 418</a>) that the tide may be propagated from
the ocean through different channels towards the same port, and may
pass quicker through some channels than through others, in which case
the same tide, divided into two or more succeeding one another, may
compound new motions of different kinds. Let us suppose one tide to be
divided into two equal tides, the former whereof precedes the other by
the space of six hours, and happens at the third or twenty-seventh hour
from the appulse of the moon to the meridian of the port. If the moon
at the time of this appulse to the meridian was in the equator, every
six hours alternately there would arise equal floods, which, meeting
with as many equal ebbs, would so balance one the other, that, for
that day, the water would stagnate, and remain quiet. If the moon then
declined from the equator, the tides in the ocean would be alternately
greater and less, as was said; and from hence two greater and two
lesser tides would be alternately propagated towards that port. But
the two greater floods would make the greatest height of the waters to
fall out in the middle time betwixt both, and the greater and lesser
floods would make the waters to rise to a mean height in the middle
time between them; and in the middle time between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</span> the two lesser
floods the waters would rise to their least height. Thus in the space
of twenty-four hours the waters would come, not twice, but once only to
their greatest, and once only to their least height; and their greatest
height, if the moon declined towards the elevated pole, would happen
at the sixth or thirtieth hour after the appulse of the moon to the
meridian; and when the moon changed its declination, this flood would
be changed into an ebb.</p>

<p>Of all which we have an example in the port of <i>Batsham</i>, in the
kingdom of <i>Tunquin</i>, in the latitude of 20° 50' north. In that
port, on the day which follows after the passage of the moon over the
equator, the waters stagnate; when the moon declines to the north, they
begin to flow and ebb, not twice, as in other ports, but once only
every day; and the flood happens at the setting, and the greatest ebb
at the rising of the moon. This tide increaseth with the declination
of the moon till the seventh or eighth day; then for the seventh or
eighth day following it decreaseth at the same rate as it had increased
before, and ceaseth when the moon changeth its declination. After which
the flood is immediately changed into an ebb; and thenceforth the
ebb happens at the setting and the flood at the rising of the moon,
till the moon again changes its declination. There are two inlets
from the ocean to this port; one more direct and short between the
island <i>Hainan</i> and the coast of <i>Quantung</i>, a province of
<i>China</i>; the other round about between the same island and the
coast of <i>Cochim</i>; and through the shorter passage the tide is
sooner propagated to <i>Batsham</i>.</p>

<p>In the channels of rivers the influx and reflux depends upon the
current of the rivers, which obstructs the ingress of the waters from
the sea, and promotes their egress to the sea, making the ingress later
and slower, and the egress sooner and faster; and hence it is that the
reflux is of longer duration that the influx, especially far up the
rivers, where the force of the sea is less. So <i>Sturmy</i> tells us,
that in the river <i>Avon</i>, three miles below <i>Bristol</i>, the
water flows only five hours, but ebbs seven; and without doubt the
difference is yet greater above <i>Bristol</i>, as at <i>Caresham</i>
or the <i>Bath</i>. This difference does likewise depend upon the
quantity of the flux and reflux; for the more vehement motion of
the sea near the syzygies of the luminaries more easily overcoming
the resistance of the rivers, will make the ingress of the water to
happen sooner and to continue longer, and will therefore diminish this
difference. But while the moon is approaching to the syzygies, the
rivers will be more plentifully filled, their currents being obstructed
by the greatness of the tides, and therefore will something more retard
the reflux of the sea a little after than a little before the syzygies.
Upon which account the slowest tides of all will not happen in the
syzygies, but precede them a little; and I observed above that the
tides before the syzygies were also retarded by the force of the sun;
and from both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</span> causes conjoined the retardation of the tides will be
both greater and sooner before the syzygies. All which I find to be so,
by the tide-tables which <i>Flamsted</i> has composed from a great many
observations.</p>

<p>By the laws we have been describing, the times of the tides are
governed; but the greatness of the tides depends upon the greatness
of the seas. Let C represent the centre of the earth, EADB the oval
figure of the seas, CA the longer semi-axis of this oval, CB the
shorter insisting at right angles upon the former, D the middle point
between A and B, and ECF or <i>e</i>C<i>f</i> the angle at the centre
of the earth, subtended by the breadth of the sea that terminates in
the shores E, F, or <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>. Now, supposing that the point
A is in the middle between the points E, F, and the point D in the
middle between the points <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, if the difference of the
heights CA, CB, represent the quantity of the tide in a very deep sea
surrounding the whole earth, the excess of the height CA above the
height CE or CF will represent the quantity of the tide in the middle
of the sea EF, terminated by the shores E, F; and the excess of the
height C<i>e</i> above the height C<i>f</i> will nearly represent the
quantity of the tide on the shores <i>f</i> of the same sea. Whence
it appears that the tides are far less in the middle of the sea
than at the shores; and that the tides at the shores are nearly as
EF (<a href="#Page_451" class="pginternal">p. 451</a>, <a href="#Page_452" class="pginternal">452</a>), the breadth of the sea not exceeding a quadrantal
arc. And hence it is that near the equator, where the sea between
<i>Africa</i> and <i>America</i> is narrow, the tides are far less
than towards either side in the temperate zones, where the seas are
extended wider; or on almost all the shores of the Pacific sea, as well
towards <i>America</i> as towards <i>China</i>, and within as well as
without the tropics; and that in islands in the middle of the sea they
scarcely rise higher than two or three feet, but on the shores of great
continents are three or four times greater, and above, especially if
the motions propagated from the ocean are by degrees contracted into a
narrow space, and the water, to fill and empty the bays alternately,
is forced to flow and ebb with great violence through shallow places;
as <i>Plymouth</i> and <i>Chepstow Bridge</i> in <i>England</i>,
at the mount of <i>St. Michael</i> and town of <i>Avranches</i> in
<i>Normandy</i>, and at <i>Cambaia</i> and <i>Pegu</i> in the <i>East
Indies</i>. In which places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</span> the sea, hurried in and out with great
violence, sometimes lays the shores under water, sometimes leaves them
dry, for many miles. Nor is the force of the influx and efflux to be
broke till it has raised or depressed the water to forty or fifty feet
and more. Thus also long and shallow straits that open to the sea with
mouths wider and deeper than the rest of their channel (such as those
about <i>Britain</i> and the <i>Magellanic Straits</i> at the eastern
entry) will have a greater flood and ebb, or will more intend and remit
their course, and therefore will rise higher and be depressed lower. On
the coast of <i>South America</i> it is said that the <i>Pacific</i>
sea in its reflux sometimes retreats two miles, and gets out of sight
of those that stand on shore. Whence in these places the floods will
be also higher; but in deeper waters the velocity of influx and efflux
is always less, and therefore the ascent and descent is so too. Nor in
such places is the ocean known to ascend to more than six, eight, or
ten feet. The quantity of the ascent I compute in the following manner:</p>

<p>Let S represent the sun, T the earth (<a href="#Page_419" class="pginternal">419</a>, <a href="#Page_420" class="pginternal">420</a>), P the moon, PAGB the
moon's orbit. In SP take SK equal to ST and SL to SK in the duplicate
ratio of SK to SP. Parallel to PT draw LM; and, supposing the mean
quantity of the circum-solar force directed towards the earth to be
represented by the distance ST or SK, SL will represent the quantity
thereof directed towards the moon. But that force is compounded of
the parts SM, LM; of which the force LM and that part of SM which is
represented by TM, do disturb the motion of the moon (as appears from
Prop. LXVI, and its Corollaries). In so far as the earth and moon are
revolved about their common centre of gravity, the earth will be liable
to the action of the like forces. But we may refer the sums as well of
the forces as of the motions to the moon, and represent the sums of
the forces by the lines TM and ML, which are proportional to them. The
force LM, in its mean quantity, is to the force by which the moon may
be revolved in an orbit, about the earth quiescent, at the distance PT
in the duplicate ratio of the moon's periodic time about the earth to
the earth's periodic time about the sun (by Cor. XVII, Prop. LXVI);

to the force of gravity with us as 1 to 60 × 60 nearly; and therefore

which the moon's motions are disturbed.</p>

<p>If from the moon's orbit (<a href="#Page_449" class="pginternal">p. 449</a>) we descend to the earth's surface,
those forces will be diminished in the ratio of the distances

38604600 times less than the force of gravity. But this force acting
equally every where upon the earth, will scarcely effect any change
on the motion of the sea, and therefore may be neglected in the
explication of that motion. The other force TM, in places where the sun
is vertical, or in their nadir, is triple the quantity of the force ML,
and therefore but 12868200 times less than the force of gravity.</p>

<p>Suppose now ADBE to represent the spherical surface of the earth,
<i>a</i>D<i>b</i>E the surface of the water overspreading it, C the
centre of both, A the place to which the sun is vertical, B the
place opposite; D, E, places at 90 degrees distance from the former;
ACE<i>mlk</i> a right angled cylindric canal passing through the
earth's centre. The force TM in any place is as the distance of the
place from the plane DE, on which a line from A to C insists at right
angles, and therefore in the part of the canal which is represented
by EC<i>lm</i> is of no quantity, but in the other part AC<i>lk</i>
is as the gravity at the several heights; for in descending towards
the centre of the earth, gravity is (by Prop. LXXIII) every where as
the height; and therefore the force TM drawing the water upwards will
diminish its gravity in the leg AC<i>lk</i> of the canal in a given
ratio: upon which account the water will ascend in this leg, till its
defect of gravity is supplied by its greater height; nor will it rest
in an equilibrium till its total gravity becomes equal to the total
gravity in EC<i>lm</i>, the other leg of the canal. Because the gravity
of every particle is as its distance from the earth's centre, the
weight of the whole water in either leg will increase in the duplicate
ratio of the height; and therefore the height of the water in the leg
AC<i>lk</i> will be to the height thereof in the leg C<i>lm</i>E in
the subduplicate ratio of the number 12868201 to 12868200, or in the
ratio of the number 25623053 to the number 25623052, and the height of
the water in the leg EC<i>lm</i> to the difference of the heights, as
25623052 to 1. But the height in the leg EC<i>lm</i> is of 19615800
<i>Paris</i> feet, as has been lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</span> found by the mensuration of the
<i>French</i>; and, therefore, by the preceding analogy, the difference
of the heights comes out <img alt="" data-tex="9\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/1297.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1297.svg"> inches of the <i>Paris</i>
foot; and the sun's force will make the height of the sea at A to
exceed the height of the same at E by 9 inches. And though the water
of the canal ACE<i>mlk</i> be supposed to be frozen into a hard and
solid consistence, yet the heights thereof at A and E, and all other
intermediate places, would still remain the same.</p>

<figure class="figleft width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_544"> <img alt="The height of the tide under the equator arising from the force of the sun computed." height="161" src="images/i_544.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_544.jpg">
</figure>

<p>Let A<i>a</i> (in the following figure) represent that excess of height
of 9 inches at A, and h<i>f</i> the excess of height at any other place
<i>h</i>; and upon DC let fall the perpendicular <i>f</i>G, meeting
the globe of the earth in F; and because the distance of the sun is
so great that all the right lines drawn thereto may be considered
as parallel, the force TM in any place <i>f</i> will be to the same
force in the place A as the sine FG to the radius AC. And, therefore,
since those forces tend to the sun in the direction of parallel lines,
they will generate the parallel heights F<span class="antiqua">f</span>, A<i>a</i>, in the
same ratio; and therefore the figure of the water D<i>faeb</i> will
be a spheroid made by the revolution of an ellipsis about its longer
axis <i>ab</i>. And the perpendicular height <i>fh</i> will be to
the oblique height Ff as <i>f</i>G to <i>f</i>C, or as FG to AC: and
therefore the height <i>fh</i> is to the height A<i>a</i> in the
duplicate ratio of FG to AC, that is, in the ratio of the versed sine
of double the angle DC<i>f</i> to double the radius, and is thence
given. And hence to the several moments of the apparent revolution of
the sun about the earth we may infer the proportion of the ascent and
descent of the waters at any given place under the equator, as well as
of the diminution of that ascent and descent, whether arising from the
latitude of places or from the sun's declination; viz., that on account
of the latitude of places, the ascent and descent of the sea is in all
places diminished in the duplicate ratio of the co-sines of latitude;
and on account of the sun's declination, the ascent and descent under
the equator is diminished in the duplicate ratio of the co-sine of
declination. And in places without the equator the half sum of the
morning and evening ascents (that is, the mean ascent) is diminished
nearly in the same ratio.</p>

<p>Let S and L respectively represent the forces of the sun and
moon placed in the equator, and at their mean distances from
the earth; R the radius; T and V the versed sines of double the
complements of the sun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</span> and moon's declinations to any given time;
D and E the mean apparent diameters of the sun and moon: and,
supposing F and G to be their apparent diameters to that given
time, their forces to raise the tides under the equator will be,
in the syzygies <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{\mathrm{VG}^{2}}{2\mathrm{RE}^{2}}\mathrm L + \dfrac{\mathrm{TF}^{2}}{2\mathrm{RD}^{2}}\mathrm S" src="images/1298.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.952ex; width: 18.266ex; height: 5.525ex;" id="img_images_1298.svg">;</span> in the

And if the same ratio is likewise observed under the parallels, from
observations accurately made in our northern climates we may determine
the proportion of the forces L and S; and then by means of this rule
predict the quantities of the tides to every syzygy and quadrature.</p>

<p>At the mouth of the river <i>Avon</i>, three miles below <i>Bristol</i>
(<a href="#Page_450" class="pginternal">p. 450</a> to <a href="#Page_453" class="pginternal">453</a>), in spring and autumn, the whole ascent of the water
in the conjunction or opposition of the luminaries (by the observation
of <i>Sturmy</i>) is about 45 feet, but in the quadratures only
25. Because the apparent diameters of the luminaries are not here
determined, let us assume them in their mean quantities, as well
as the moon's declination in the equinoctial quadratures in its
mean quantity, that is, <img alt="" data-tex="23\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1097.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1097.svg_2"><sup>°</sup>; and the versed sine
of double its complement will be 1682, supposing the radius to be
1000. But the declinations of the sun in the equinoxes and of the
moon in the syzygies are of no quantity, and the versed sines of
double the complements are each 2000. Whence those forces become L
+ S in the syzygies, and <img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{1682}{2000}\mathrm L - \mathrm S" src="images/1300.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 10.958ex; height: 4.638ex;" id="img_images_1300.svg"> in the quadratures; respectively proportional to the heights of
the tides of 45 and 25 feet, or of 9 and 5 paces. And, therefore,
multiplying the extremes and the means, we have
<span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="5\mathrm L + 5\mathrm S = \dfrac{15138}{2000}\mathrm L - 9\mathrm S" src="images/1301.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 23.938ex; height: 4.638ex;" id="img_images_1301.svg">,</span> or

<p>But farther; I remember to have been told that in summer the ascent of
the sea in the syzygies is to the ascent thereof in the quadratures
as about 5 to 4. In the solstices themselves it is probable that the
proportion may be something less, as about 6 to 5; whence it would
follow that L is = <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{1}{6}\mathrm S" src="images/1303.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.185ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1303.svg"> [for then the proportion
is <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\dfrac{1682}{2000}\mathrm L + \dfrac{1682}{2000}\mathrm S : \mathrm L - \dfrac{1682}{2000}\mathrm {S}::6:5" src="images/1304.svg" style="vertical-align: -1.602ex; width: 35.985ex; height: 4.638ex;" id="img_images_1304.svg">]</span>.
Till we can more certainly determine the proportion from observation,
let us assume <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="\mathrm L = 5\tfrac{1}{3}\mathrm S" src="images/1305.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 8.616ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1305.svg">;</span> and since the
heights of the tides are as the forces which excite them, and the force
of the sun is able to raise the tides to the height of nine inches,
the moon's force will be sufficient to raise the same to the height of
four feet. And if we allow that this height may be doubled, or perhaps
tripled, by that force of reciprocation which we observe in the motion
of the waters, and by which their motion once begun is kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_546">[Pg 546]</span> up for
some time, there will be force enough to generate all that quantity of
tides which we really find in the ocean.</p>

<p>Thus we have seen that these forces are sufficient to move the sea.
But, so far as I can observe, they will not be able to produce any
other effect sensible on our earth; for since the weight of one grain
in 4000 is not sensible in the nicest balance; and the sun's force to
move the tides is 12868200 less than the force of gravity; and the sum
of the forces of both moon and sun, exceeding the sun's force only in
the ratio of <img alt="" data-tex="6\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/1306.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1306.svg"> to 1, is still 2032890 times less than
the force of gravity; it is evident that both forces together are 500
times less than what is required sensibly to increase or diminish the
weight of any body in a balance. And, therefore, they will not sensibly
move any suspended body; nor will they produce any sensible effect on
pendulums, barometers, bodies swimming in stagnant water, or in the
like statical experiments. In the atmosphere, indeed, they will excite
such a flux and reflux as they do in the sea, but with so small a
motion that no sensible wind will be thence produced.</p>

<p>If the effects of both moon and sun in raising the tides (<a href="#Page_454" class="pginternal">p. 454</a>), as
well as their apparent diameters, were equal among themselves, their
absolute forces would (by Cor. XIV, Prop. LXVI) be as their magnitudes.
But the effect of the moon is to the effect of the sun as about
<img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/887.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_887.svg_1"> to 1; and the moon's diameter less than the sun's
in the ratio of <img alt="" data-tex="31\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1307.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1307.svg"> to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="32\tfrac{1}{5}" src="images/1308.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1308.svg">,</span> or of 45 to
16. Now the force of the moon is to be increased in the ratio of the
effect directly, and in the triplicate ratio of the diameter inversely.
Whence the force of the moon compared with its magnitude will be to the
force of the sun compared with its magnitude in the ratio compounded
of <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{1}{3}" src="images/887.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_887.svg_2"> to 1, and the triplicate of 45 to 46 inversely,
that is, in the ratio of about <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{7}{10}" src="images/1309.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_1309.svg"> to 1. And therefore
the moon, in respect of the magnitude of its body, has an absolute
centripetal force greater than the sun in respect of the magnitude of
its body in the ratio to <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{7}{10}" src="images/1309.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_1309.svg_1"> to 1, and is therefore more
dense in the same ratio.</p>

<p>In the time of 27<sup>d</sup>. 7<sup>h</sup>. 43', in which the moon makes its revolution
about the earth, a planet may be revolved about the sun at the distance
of 18,954 diameters of the sun from the sun's centre, supposing the
mean apparent diameter of the sun to be <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="32\tfrac{1}{5}'" src="images/1310.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.686ex; height: 3.051ex;" id="img_images_1310.svg">;</span> and in
the same time the moon may be revolved about the earth at rest, at the
distance of 30 of the earth's diameters. If in both cases the number
of diameters was the same, the absolute circum-terrestrial force
would (by Cor. II, Prop. LXXII) be to the absolute circum-solar force
as the magnitude of the earth to the magnitude of the sun. Because
the number of the earth's diameters is greater in the ratio of 30 to
18,954, the body of the earth will be less in the triplicate of that
ratio, that is, in the ratio of <img alt="" data-tex="3\tfrac{28}{29}" src="images/1311.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1311.svg"> to 1. Wherefore
the earth's force, for the magnitude of its body, is to the sun's

and consequently the earth's density to the sun's will be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_547">[Pg 547]</span> the
same ratio. Since, then, the moon's density is to the sun's density
as <img alt="" data-tex="5\tfrac{7}{10}" src="images/1309.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 3.726ex; height: 2.789ex;" id="img_images_1309.svg_2"> to 1, the moon's density will be to the earth's

Wherefore since the moon's magnitude is to the earth's magnitude as
about 1 to <span class="nowrap"><img alt="" data-tex="41\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1312.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1312.svg">,</span> the moon's absolute centripetal force
will be to the earth's absolute centripetal force as about 1 to 29,
and the quantity of matter in the moon to the quantity of matter in
the earth in the same ratio. And hence the common centre of gravity of
the earth and moon is more exactly determined than hitherto has been
done; from the knowledge of which we may now infer the moon's distance
from the earth with greater accuracy. But I would rather wait till the
proportion of the bodies of the moon and earth one to the other is
more exactly defined from the phænomena of the tides, hoping that in
the mean time the circumference of the earth may be measured from more
distant stations than any body has yet employed for this purpose.</p>

<p>Thus I have given an account of the system of the planets. As to the
fixed stars, the smallness of their annual parallax proves them to be
removed to immense distances from the system of the planets: that this
parallax is less than one minute is most certain; and from thence it
follows that the distance of the fixed stars is above 360 times greater
than the distance of Saturn from the sun. Such as reckon the earth
one of the planets, and the sun one of the fixed stars, may remove
the fixed stars to yet greater distances by the following arguments:
from the annual motion of the earth there would happen an apparent
transposition of the fixed stars, one in respect of another, almost
equal to their double parallax: but the greater and nearer stars, in
respect of the more remote, which are only seen by the telescope, have
not hitherto been observed to have the least motion. If we should
suppose that motion to be but less than 20'', the distance of the
nearer fixed stars would exceed the mean distance of Saturn by above
2000 times. Again; the disk of Saturn, which is only 17'' or 18'' in
diameter, receives but about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{2100000000}" src="images/1313.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 8.994ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1313.svg"> of the sun's
light; for so much less is that disk than the whole spherical surface
of the orb of Saturn. Now if we suppose Saturn to reflect about
<img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4}" src="images/228.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_228.svg_13"> of this light, the whole light reflected from its
illuminated hemisphere will be about <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{1}{4200000000}" src="images/1314.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 8.994ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1314.svg"> of the
whole light emitted from the sun's hemisphere; and, therefore, since
light is rarefied in the duplicate ratio of the distance from the
luminous body, if the sun was <img alt="" data-tex="10000 \sqrt{42}" src="images/1315.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.213ex; width: 9.848ex; height: 2.398ex;" id="img_images_1315.svg"> times more distant
than Saturn, it would yet appear as lucid as Saturn now does without
its ring, that is, something more lucid than a fixed star of the first
magnitude. Let us, therefore, suppose that the distance from which the
sun would shine as a fixed star exceeds that of Saturn by about 100,000
times, and its apparent diameter will be 7<sup>v</sup>. 16<sup>vi</sup>. and its parallax
arising from the annual motion of the earth 13'''': and so great will
be the distance, the apparent diameter, and the parallax of the fixed
stars of the first magnitude, in bulk and light equal to our sun.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</span> Some
may, perhaps, imagine that a great part of the light of the fixed stars
is intercepted and lost in its passage through so vast spaces, and upon
that account pretend to place the fixed stars at nearer distances; but
at this rate the remoter stars could be scarcely seen. Suppose, for
example, that <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/225.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_225.svg_7"> of the light perish in its passage from
the nearest fixed stars to us; then <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{3}{4}" src="images/225.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 1.795ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_225.svg_8"> will twice perish
in its passage through a double space, thrice through a triple, and so
forth. And, therefore, the fixed stars that are at a double distance
will be 16 times more obscure, viz., 4 times more obscure on account of
the diminished apparent diameter; and, again, 4 times more on account
of the lost light. And, by the same argument, the fixed stars at a
triple distance will be 9 × 4 × 4, or 144 times more obscure; and those
at a quadruple distance will be 16 × 4 × 4 × 4, or 1024 times more
obscure; but so great a diminution of light is no ways consistent with
the phænomena and with that hypothesis which places the fixed stars at
different distances.</p>

<p>The fixed stars being, therefore, at such vast distances from one
another (<a href="#Page_460" class="pginternal">p. 460</a>, <a href="#Page_461" class="pginternal">461</a>), can neither attract each other sensibly, nor be
attracted by our sun. But the comets must unavoidably be acted on by
the circum-solar force; for as the comets were placed by astronomers
above the moon, because they were found to have no diurnal parallax,
so their annual parallax is a convincing proof of their descending
into the regions of the planets. For all the comets which move in a
direct course, according to the order of the signs, about the end of
their appearance become more than ordinarily slow, or retrograde, if
the earth is between them and the sun; and more than ordinarily swift
if the earth is approaching to a heliocentric opposition with them.
Whereas, on the other hand, those which move against the order of the
signs, towards the end of their appearance, appear swifter than they
ought to be if the earth is between them and the sun; and slower, and
perhaps retrograde, if the earth is in the other side of its orbit.
This is occasioned by the motion of the earth in different situations.
If the earth go the same way with the comet, with a swifter motion,
the comet becomes retrograde; if with a slower motion, the comet
becomes slower, however; and if the earth move the contrary way, it
becomes swifter; and by collecting the differences between the slower
and swifter motions, and the sums of the more swift and retrograde
motions, and comparing them with the situation and motion of the earth
from whence they arise, I found, by means of this parallax, that the
distances of the comets at the time they cease to be visible to the
naked eye are always less than the distance of Saturn, and generally
even less than the distance of Jupiter.</p>

<p>The same thing may be collected from the curvature of the way of the
comets (<a href="#Page_462" class="pginternal">p. 462</a>). These bodies go on nearly in great circles while their
motion continues swift; but about the end of their course, when that
part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</span> of their apparent motion which arises from the parallax bears
a greater proportion to their whole apparent motion, they commonly
deviate from those circles; and when the earth goes to one side, they
deviate to the other; and this deflection, because of its corresponding
with the motion of the earth, must arise chiefly from the parallax;
and the quantity thereof is so considerable, as, by my computation, to
place the disappearing comets a good deal lower than Jupiter. Whence
it follows, that, when they approach nearer to us in their perigees
and perihelions, they often descend below the orbits of Mars and the
inferior planets.</p>

<p>Moreover, this nearness of the comets is confirmed by the annual
parallax of the orbit, in so far as the same is pretty nearly collected
by the supposition that the comets move uniformly in right lines.
The method of collecting the distance of a comet according to this
hypothesis from four observations (first attempted by <i>Kepler</i>,
and perfected by Dr. <i>Wallis</i> and Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i>)
is well known; and the comets reduced to this regularity generally
pass through the middle of the planetary region. So the comets of the
year 1607 and 1618, as their motions are defined by <i>Kepler</i>,
passed between the sun and the earth; that of the year 1664 below the
orbit of Mars; and that in 1680 below the orbit of Mercury, as its
motion was defined by Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i> and others. By a
like rectilinear hypothesis, <i>Hevelius</i> placed all the comets
about which we have any observations below the orbit of Jupiter. It is
a false notion, therefore, and contrary to astronomical calculation,
which some have entertained, who, from the regular motion of the
comets, either remove them into the regions of the fixed stars, or deny
the motion of the earth; whereas their motions cannot be reduced to
perfect regularity, unless we suppose them to pass through the regions
near the earth in motion; and these are the arguments drawn from the
parallax, so far as it can be determined without an exact knowledge of
the orbits and motions of the comets.</p>

<p>The near approach of the comets is farther confirmed from the light
of their heads (<a href="#Page_463" class="pginternal">p. 463</a>, <a href="#Page_465" class="pginternal">465</a>); for the light of a celestial body,
illuminated by the sun, and receding to remote parts, is diminished in
the quadruplicate proportion of the distance; to wit, in one duplicate
proportion on account of the increase of the distance from the sun;
and in another duplicate proportion on account of the decrease of the
apparent diameter. Hence it may be inferred, that Saturn being at a
double distance, and having its apparent diameter nearly half of that
of Jupiter, must appear about 16 times more obscure; and that, if its
distance were 4 times greater, its light would be 256 times less; and
therefore would be hardly perceivable to the naked eye. But now the
comets often equal Saturn's light, without exceeding him in their
apparent diameters. So the comet of the year 1668, according to Dr.
<i>Hooke's</i> observations, equalled in brightness the light of a
fixed star of the first magnitude; and its head, or the star in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</span> the
middle of the coma, appeared, through a telescope of 15 feet, as lucid
as Saturn near the horizon; but the diameter of the head was only 25''
that is, almost the same with the diameter of a circle equal to Saturn
and his ring. The coma or hair surrounding the head was about ten times
as broad; namely, <img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{1}{6}" src="images/1316.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1316.svg"> min. Again; the least diameter of
the hair of the comet of the year 1682, observed by Mr. <i>Flamsted</i>
with a tube of 16 feet and measured with the micrometer, was 2' 0'';
but the nucleus, or star in the middle, scarcely possessed the tenth
part of this breadth, and was therefore only 11'' or 12'' broad;
but the light and clearness of its head exceeded that of the year
1680, and was equal to that of the stars of the first or second
magnitude. Moreover, the comet of the year 1665, in <i>April</i>,
as <i>Hevelius</i> informs us, exceeded almost all the fixed stars
in splendor, and even Saturn itself, as being of a much more vivid
colour; for this comet was more lucid than that which appeared at the
end of the foregoing year and was compared to the stars of the first
magnitude. The diameter of the coma was about 6'; but the nucleus,
compared with the planets by means of a telescope, was plainly less
than Jupiter, and was sometimes thought less, sometimes equal to the
body of Saturn within the ring. To this breadth add that of the ring,
and the whole face of Saturn will be twice as great as that of the
comet, with a light not at all more intense; and therefore the comet
was nearer to the sun than Saturn. From the proportion of the nucleus
to the whole head found by these observations, and from its breadth,
which seldom exceeds 8' or 12', it appears that the stars of the comets
are most commonly of the same apparent magnitude as the planets; but
that their light may be compared oftentimes with that of Saturn, and
sometimes exceeds it. And hence it is certain that in their perihelia
their distances can scarcely be greater than that of Saturn. At twice
that distance, the light would be four times less, which besides by
its dim paleness would be as much inferior to the light of Saturn as
the light of Saturn is to the splendor of Jupiter: but this difference
would be easily observed. At a distance ten times greater, their bodies
must be greater than that of the sun; but their light would be 100
times fainter than that of Saturn. And at distances still greater,
their bodies would far exceed the sun; but, being in such dark regions,
they must be no longer visible. So impossible is it to place the comets
in the middle regions between the sun and fixed stars, accounting the
sun as one of the fixed stars; for certainly they would receive no more
light there from the sun than we do from the greatest of the fixed
stars.</p>

<p>So far we have gone without considering that obscuration which comets
suffer from that plenty of thick smoke which encompasseth their heads,
and through which the heads always shew dull as through a cloud; for
by how much the more a body is obscured by this smoke, by so much the
more near it must be allowed to come to the sun, that it may vie with
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</span> planets in the quantity of light which it reflects; whence it is
probable that the comets descend far below the orbit of Saturn, as
we proved before from their parallax. But, above all, the thing is
evinced from their tails, which must be owing either to the sun's light
reflected from a smoke arising from them, and dispersing itself through
the æther, or to the light of their own heads.</p>

<p>In the former case we must shorten the distance of the comets, lest
we be obliged to allow that the smoke arising from their heads is
propagated through such a vast extent of space, and with such a
velocity of expansion, as will seem altogether incredible; in the
latter case the whole light of both head and tail must be ascribed to
the central nucleus. But, then, if we suppose all this light to be
united and condensed within the disk of the nucleus, certainly the
nucleus will by far exceed Jupiter itself in splendor, especially
when it emits a very large and lucid tail. If, therefore, under a
less apparent diameter, it reflects more light, it must be much more
illuminated by the sun, and therefore much nearer to it. So the comet
that appeared <i>Dec. 12</i> and <i>15</i>, O.S. <i>Anno 1679</i>, at
the time it emitted a very shining tail, whose splendor was equal to
that of many stars like Jupiter, if their light were dilated and spread
through so great a space, was, as to the magnitude of its nucleus,
less than Jupiter (as Mr. <i>Flamsted</i> observed), and therefore was
much nearer to the sun: nay, it was even less than Mercury. For on
the 17th of that month, when it was nearer to the earth, it appeared
to <i>Cassini</i> through a telescope of 35 feet a little less than
the globe of Saturn. On the 8th of this month, in the morning, Dr.
<i>Halley</i> saw the tail, appearing broad and very short, and as
if it rose from the body of the sun itself, at that time very near
its rising. Its form was like that of an extraordinary bright cloud;
nor did it disappear till the sun itself began to be seen above the
horizon. Its splendor, therefore, exceeded the light of the clouds
till the sun rose, and far surpassed that of all the stars together,
as yielding only to the immediate brightness of the sun itself.
Neither Mercury, nor Venus, nor the moon itself, are seen so near the
rising sun. Imagine all this dilated light collected together, and
to be crowded into the orbit of the comet's nucleus which was less
than Mercury; by its splendor, thus increased, becoming so much more
conspicuous, it will vastly exceed Mercury, and therefore must be
nearer to the sun. On the 12th and 15th of the same month, this tail,
extending itself over a much greater space, appeared more rare; but
its light was still so vigorous as to become visible when the fixed
stars were hardly to be seen, and soon after to appear like a fiery
beam shining in a wonderful manner. From its length, which was 40 or 50
degrees, and its breadth of 2 degrees, we may compute what the light of
the whole must be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</span></p>

<p>This near approach of the comets to the sun is confirmed from the
situation they are seen in when their tails appear most resplendent;
for when the head passes by the sun, and lies hid under the solar
rays, very bright and shining tails, like fiery beams, are said to
issue from the horizon; but afterwards, when the head begins to appear,
and is got farther from the sun, that splendor always decreases, and
turns by degrees into a paleness like to that of the milky way, but
much more sensible at first; after that vanishing gradually. Such was
that most resplendent comet described by <i>Aristotle</i>, Lib. 1,
Meteor. 6. "The head thereof could not be seen, because it set before
the sun, or at least was hid under the sun's rays; but the next day
it was seen as well as might be; for, having left the sun but a very
little way, it set immediately after it; and the scattered light of
the head obscured by the too great splendour (of the tail) did not yet
appear. But afterwards (says <i>Aristotle</i>), when the splendour
of the tail was now diminished (the head of), the comet recovered
its native brightness. And the splendour of its tail reached now to
a third part of the heavens (that is, to 60°). It appeared in the
winter season, and, rising to <i>Orion's</i> girdle, there vanished
away." Two comets of the same kind are described by <i>Justin</i>,
Lib. 37, which, according to his account, "shined so bright, that the
whole heaven seemed to be on fire; and by their greatness filled up a
fourth part of the heavens, and by their splendour exceeded that of the
sun." By which last words a near position of these bright comets and
the rising or setting sun is intimated (<a href="#Page_494" class="pginternal">p. 494</a>, <a href="#Page_495" class="pginternal">495</a>). We may add to
these the comet of the year 1101 or 1106, "the star of which was small
and obscure (like that of 1680); but the splendour arising from it
extremely bright, reaching like a fiery beam to the east and north," as
<i>Hevelius</i> has it from <i>Simeon</i>, the monk of <i>Durham</i>.
It appeared at the beginning of <i>February</i> about the evening in
the south-west. From this and from the situation of the tail we may
infer that the head was near the sun. <i>Matthew Paris</i> says, "it
was about one cubit from the sun; from the third [or rather the sixth]
to the ninth hour sending out a long stream of light." The comet of
1264, in <i>July</i>, or about the solstice, preceded the rising sun,
sending out its beams with a great light towards the west as far as
the middle of the heavens; and at the beginning it ascended a little
above the horizon: but as the sun went forwards it retired every day
farther from the horizon, till it passed by the very middle of the
heavens. It is said to have been at the beginning large and bright,
having a large coma, which decayed from day to day. It is described
in <i>Append. Matth. Paris, Hist. Ang.</i> after this manner: "<i>An.
Christi 1265</i>, there appeared a comet so wonderful, that none then
living had ever seen the like; for, rising from the east with a great
brightness, it extended itself with a great light as far as the middle
of the hemisphere towards the west." The Latin original being somewhat
barbarous and obscure, it is here subjoined. <i>Ab oriente enim cum
magno fulgore surgens, usque ad medium hemisphærii versus occidentem,
omnia perlucide pertrahebat.</i></p>

<p>"In the year 1401 or 1402, the sun being got below the horizon, there
appeared in the west a bright and shining comet, sending out a tail
upwards, in splendor like a flame of fire, and in form like a spear,
darting its rays from west to east. When the sun was sunk below the
horizon, by the lustre of its own rays it enlightened all the borders
of the earth, not permitting the other stars to shew their light, or
the shades of night to darken the air, because its light exceeded
that of the others, and extended itself to the upper part of the
heavens, flaming," &amp;c., <i>Hist. Byzant. Duc. Mich. Nepot.</i> From
the situation of the tail of this comet, and the time of its first
appearance, we may infer that the head was then near the sun, and went
farther from him every day; for that comet continued three months. In
the year <i>1527, Aug. 11</i>, about four in the morning, there was
seen almost throughout <i>Europe</i> a terrible comet in <i>Leo</i>,
which continued flaming an hour and a quarter every day. It rose from
the east, and ascended to the south and west to a prodigious length. It
was most conspicuous to the north, and its cloud (that is, its tail)
was very terrible; having, according to the fancies of the vulgar, the
form of an arm a little bent holding a sword of a vast magnitude. In
the year 1618, in the end of <i>November</i>, there began a rumour,
that there appeared about sun-rising a bright beam, which was the
tail of a comet whose head was yet concealed within the brightness
of the solar rays. On <i>Nov. 24</i>, and from that time, the comet
itself appeared with a bright light, its head and tail being extremely
resplendent. The length of the tail, which was at first 20 or 30 deg.,
increased till <i>December 9</i>, when it arose to 75 deg., but with
a light much more faint and dilute than at the beginning. In the year
1668, <i>March 5</i>, N. S., about 7 in the evening, <i>P. Valent.
Estancius</i>, being in <i>Brazil</i>, saw a comet near the horizon in
the south-west. Its head was small, and scarcely discernible, but its
tail extremely bright and refulgent, so that the reflection of it from
the sea was easily seen by those who stood upon the shore. This great
splendor lasted but three days, decreasing very remarkably from that
time. The tail at the beginning extended itself from west to south, and
in a situation almost parallel to the horizon, appearing like a shining
beam 23 deg. in length. Afterwards, the light decreasing, its magnitude
increased till the comet ceased to be visible; so that <i>Cassini</i>,
at <i>Bologna</i>, saw it (<i>Mar. 10</i>, <i>11</i>, <i>12</i>)
rising from the horizon 32 deg. in length. In <i>Portugal</i> it is
said to have taken up a fourth part of the heavens (that is, 45 deg.),
extending itself from west to east with a notable brightness; though
the whole of it was not seen, because the head in this part of the
world always lay hid below the horizon. From the increase of the tail
it is plain that the head receded from the sun, and was nearest to it
at the beginning, when the tail appeared brightest.</p>

<p>To all these we may add the comet of 1680, whose wonderful splendor at
the conjunction of the head with the sun was above described. But so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</span>
great a splendor argues the comets of this kind to have really passed
near the fountain of light, especially since the tails never shine so
much in their opposition to the sun; nor do we read that fiery beams
have ever appeared there.</p>

<p>Lastly, the same thing is inferred (<a href="#Page_466" class="pginternal">p. 466</a>, <a href="#Page_467" class="pginternal">467</a>) from the light of the
heads increasing in the recess of the comets from the earth towards
the sun, and decreasing in their return from the sun towards the
earth; for so the last comet of the year 1665 (by the observation of
<i>Hevelius</i>), from the time that it was first seen, was always
losing of its apparent motion, and therefore had already passed its
perigee; yet the splendor of its head was daily increasing, till,
being hid by the sun's rays, the comet ceased to appear. The comet of
the year 1683 (by the observation of the same <i>Hevelius</i>), about
the end of <i>July</i>, when it first appeared, moved at a very slow
rate, advancing only about 40 or 45 minutes in its orbit in a day's
time. But from that time its diurnal motion was continually upon the
increase till <i>September 4</i>, when it arose to about 5 degrees; and
therefore in all this interval of time the comet was approaching to the
earth. Which is likewise proved from the diameter of its head measured
with a micrometer; for, <i>August</i> the 6th, <i>Hevelius</i> found it
only 6' 5'', including the coma; which, <i>September 2</i>, he observed
9' 7''. And therefore its head appeared far less about the beginning
than towards the end of its motion, though about the beginning,
because nearer to the sun, it appeared far more lucid than towards
the end, as the same <i>Hevelius</i> declares. Wherefore in all this
interval of time, on account of its recess from the sun, it decreased
in splendor, notwithstanding its access towards the earth. The comet
of the year 1618, about the middle of <i>December</i>, and that of the
year 1680, about the end of the same month, did both move with their
greatest velocity, and were therefore then in their perigees; but the
greatest splendor of their heads was seen two weeks before, when they
had just got clear of the sun's rays; and the greatest splendor of
their tails a little more early, when yet nearer to the sun. The head
of the former comet, according to the observations of <i>Cysatus</i>,
<i>Dec. 1</i>, appeared greater than the stars of the first magnitude;
and, <i>Dec. 16</i> (being then in its perigee), of a small magnitude,
and the splendor or clearness was much diminished. <i>Jan. 7</i>,
<i>Kepler</i>, being uncertain about the head, left off observing.
<i>Dec. 12</i>, the head of the last comet was seen and observed by
<i>Flamsted</i> at the distance of 9 degrees from the sun, which a
star of the third magnitude could hardly have been. <i>December 15</i>
and <i>17</i>, the same appeared like a star of the third magnitude,
its splendor being diminished by the bright clouds near the setting
sun. <i>Dec. 26</i>, when it moved with the greatest swiftness, and
was almost in its perigee, it was inferior to <i>Os Pegasi</i>, a star
of the third magnitude. <i>Jan. 3</i>, it appeared like a star of the
fourth; <i>Jan. 9</i>, like a star of the fifth. <i>Jan. 13</i>, it
disappeared, by reason of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</span> brightness of the moon, which was then
in its increase. <i>Jan. 25</i>, it was scarcely equal to the stars
of the seventh magnitude. If we take equal times on each hand of the
perigee, the heads placed at remote distances would have shined equally
before and after, because of their equal distances from the earth. That
in one case they shined very bright, and in the other vanished, is
to be ascribed to the nearness of the sun in the first case, and his
distance in the other; and from the great difference of the light in
these two cases we infer its great nearness in the first of them; for
the light of the comets uses to be regular, and to appear greatest when
their heads move the swiftest, and are therefore in their perigees,
excepting in so far as it is increased by their nearness to the sun.</p>

<p>From these things I at last discovered why the comets frequent so
much the region of the sun. If they were to be seen in the regions a
great way beyond Saturn, they must appear oftener in these parts of
the heavens that are opposite to the sun; for those which are in that
situation would be nearer to the earth, and the interposition of the
sun would obscure the others: but, looking over the history of comets,
I find that four or five times more have been seen in the hemisphere
towards the sun than in the opposite hemisphere; besides, without
doubt, not a few which have been hid by the light of the sun; for
comets descending into our parts neither emit tails, nor are so well
illuminated by the sun, as to discover themselves to our naked eyes,
till they are come nearer to us than Jupiter. But the far greater part
of that spherical space, which is described about the sun with so small
an interval, lies on that side of the earth which regards the sun,
and the comets in that greater part are more strongly illuminated, as
being for the most part nearer to the sun: besides, from the remarkable
eccentricity of their orbits, it comes to pass that their lower apsides
are much nearer to the sun than if their revolutions were performed in
circles concentric to the sun.</p>

<p>Hence also we understand why the tails of the comets, while their heads
are descending towards the sun, always appear short and rare, and are
seldom said to have exceeded 15 or 20 deg. in length; but in the recess
of the heads from the sun often shine like fiery beams, and soon after
reach to 40, 50, 60, 70 deg. in length, or more. This great splendor
and length of the tails arises from the heat which the sun communicates
to the comet as it passes near it. And thence, I think, it may be
concluded, that all the comets that have had such tails have passed
very near the sun.</p>

<p>Hence also we may collect that the tails arise from the atmospheres of
the heads (<a href="#Page_487" class="pginternal">p. 487</a> to <a href="#Page_488" class="pginternal">488</a>): but we have had three several opinions about
the tails of comets; for some will have it that they are nothing else
but the beams of the sun's light transmitted through the comets' heads,
which they suppose to be transparent; others, that they proceed from
the refraction which light suffers in passing from the comet's head
to the earth;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</span> and, lastly, others, that they are a sort of clouds or
vapour constantly rising from the comets' heads, and tending towards
the parts opposite to the sun. The first is the opinion of such as are
yet unacquainted with optics; for the beams of the sun are not seen
in a darkened room, but in consequence of the light that is reflected
from them by the little particles of dust and smoke which are always
flying about in the air; and hence it is that in air impregnated with
thick smoke they appear with greater brightness, and are more faintly
and more difficultly seen in a finer air; but in the heavens, where
there is no matter to reflect the light, they are not to be seen at
all. Light is not seen as it is in the beams, but as it is thence
reflected to our eyes; for vision is not made but by rays falling upon
the eyes, and therefore there must be some reflecting matter in those
parts where the tails of comets are seen; and so the argument turns
upon the third opinion; for that reflecting matter can be no where
found but in the place of the tail, because otherwise, since all the
celestial spaces are equally illuminated by the sun's light, no part of
the heavens could appear with more splendor than another. The second
opinion is liable to many difficulties. The tails of comets are never
seen variegated with those colours which ever use to be inseparable
from refraction; and the distinct transmission of the light of the
fixed stars and planets to us is a demonstration that the æther or
celestial medium is not endowed with any refractive power. For as to
what is alledged that the fixed stars have been sometimes seen by
the <i>Egyptians</i> environed with a coma or capillitium because
that has but rarely happened, it is rather to be ascribed to a casual
refraction of clouds, as well as the radiation and scintillation of
the fixed stars to the refractions both of the eyes and air; for upon
applying a telescope to the eye, those radiations and scintillations
immediately disappear. By the tremulous agitation of the air and
ascending vapours, it happens that the rays of light are alternately
turned aside from the narrow space of the pupil of the eye; but no such
thing can have place in the much wider aperture of the object-glass
of a telescope; and hence it is that a scintillation is occasioned in
the former case which ceases in the latter; and this cessation in the
latter case is a demonstration of the regular transmission of light
through the heavens without any sensible refraction. But, to obviate
an objection that may be made from the appearing of no tail in such
comets as shine but with a faint light, as if the secondary rays were
then too weak to affect the eyes, and for this reason it is that the
tails of the fixed stars do not appear, we are to consider that by
the means of telescopes the light of the fixed stars may be augmented
above an hundred fold and yet no tails are seen; that the light of the
planets is yet more copious without any tail, but that comets are seen
sometimes with huge tails when the light of their heads is but faint
and dull; for so it happened in the comet of the year 1680, when in the
month of <i>December</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</span> it was scarcely equal in light to the stars
of the second magnitude, and yet emitted a notable tail, extending to
the length of 40°, 50°, 60°, or 70°, and upwards; and afterwards, on
the 27th and 28th of <i>January</i>, the head appeared but as a star
of the seventh magnitude; but the tail (as was said above), with a
light that was sensible enough, though faint, was stretched out to 6
or 7 degrees in length, and with a languishing light that was more
difficultly seen, even to 12° and upwards. But on the 9th and 10th of
<i>February</i>, when to the naked eye the head appeared no more, I saw
through a telescope the tail of 2° in length. But farther; if the tail
was owing to the refraction of the celestial matter, and did deviate
from the opposition of the sun, according as the figure of the heavens
requires, that deviation, in the same places of the heavens, should be
always directed towards the same parts: but the comet of the year 1680,
<i>December</i> 28<sup>d</sup>. <img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{1}{2}^{h}." src="images/1216.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1216.svg_2"> P. M. at <i>London</i>, was
seen in <i>Pisces</i>, 8° 41', with latitude north 28° 6', while the
sun was in <i>Capricorn</i> 18° 26'. And the comet of the year 1577,
<i>December 29</i>, was in <i>Pisces</i> 8° 41', with latitude north
28° 40'; and the sun, as before, in about <i>Capricorn</i> 18° 26'.
In both cases the situation of the earth was the same, and the comet
appeared in the same place of the heavens; yet in the former case the
tail of the comet (as well by my observations as by the observations
of others) deviated from the opposition of the sun towards the north
by an angle of <img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1270.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1270.svg_1"> degrees, whereas in the latter there
was (according to the observation of <i>Tycho</i>) a deviation of 21
degrees towards the south. The refraction, therefore, of the heavens
being thus disproved, it remains that the phænomena of the tails of
comets must be derived from some reflecting matter. That vapours
sufficient to fill such immense spaces may arise from the comet's
atmospheres, may be easily understood from what follows.</p>

<p>It is well known that the air near the surface of our earth possesses
a space about 1200 times greater than water of the same weight; and
therefore a cylindric column of air 1200 feet high is of equal weight
with a cylinder of water of the same breadth, and but one foot high.
But a cylinder of air reaching to the top of the atmosphere is of equal
weight with a cylinder of water about 33 feet high; and therefore if
from the whole cylinder of air the lower part of 1200 feet high is
taken away, the remaining upper part will be of equal weight with
a cylinder of water 32 feet high. Wherefore at the height of 1200
feet, or two furlongs, the weight of the incumbent air is less, and
consequently the rarity of the compressed air greater, than near
the surface of the earth in the ratio of 33 to 32. And, having this
ratio, we may compute the rarity of the air in all places whatsoever
(by the help of Cor. Prop. XXII, Book II), supposing the expansion
thereof to be reciprocally proportional to its compression; and this
proportion has been proved by the experiments of <i>Hooke</i> and
others. The result of the computation I have set down in the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</span>
table, in the first column of which you have the height of the air
in miles, whereof 4000 make a semi-diameter of the earth; in the
second the compression of the air, or the incumbent weight; in the
third its rarity or expansion, supposing gravity to decrease in the
duplicate ratio of the distances from the earth's centre. And the
<i>Latin</i> numeral characters are here used for certain numbers of
ciphers, as 0,xvii 1224 for 0,000000000000000001224, and 26956 xv for

<p>But from this table it appears that the air, in proceeding upwards, is
rarefied in such manner, that a sphere of that air which is nearest
to the earth, of but one inch in diameter, if dilated with that
rarefaction which it would have at the height of one semi-diameter
of the earth, would fill all the planetary regions as far as the
sphere of Saturn, and a great, way beyond; and at the height of ten
semi-diameters of the earth would fill up more space than is contained
in the whole heavens on this side the fixed stars, according to the
preceding computation of their distance. And though, by reason of the
far greater thickness of the atmospheres of comets, and the great
quantity of the circum-solar centripetal force, it may happen that
the air in the celestial spaces, and in the tails of comets, is not
so vastly rarefied, yet from this computation it is plain that a very
small quantity of air and vapour is abundantly sufficient to produce
all the appearances of the tails of comets; for that they are indeed
of a very notable rarity appears from the shining of the stars through
them. The atmosphere of the earth, illuminated by the sun's light,
though but of a few miles in thickness, obscures and extinguishes the
light not only of all the stars, but even of the moon itself; whereas
the smallest stars are seen to shine through the immense thickness of
the tails of comets, likewise illuminated by the sun, without the least
diminution of their splendor.</p>

<p><i>Kepler</i> ascribes the ascent of the tails of comets to the
atmospheres of their heads, and their direction towards the parts
opposite to the sun to the action of the rays of light carrying
along with them the matter of the comets' tails; and without any
great incongruity we may suppose that, in so free spaces, so fine a
matter as that of the æther may yield to the action<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</span> of the rays of
the sun's light, though those rays are not able sensibly to move the
gross substances in our parts, which are clogged with so palpable a
resistance. Another author thinks that there may be a sort of particles
of matter endowed with a principle of levity as well as others are with
a power of gravity; that the matter of the tails of comets may be of
the former sort, and that its ascent from the sun may be owing to its
levity; but, considering the gravity of terrestrial bodies is as the
matter of the bodies, and therefore can be neither more nor less in
the same quantity of matter, I am inclined to believe that this ascent
may rather proceed from the rarefaction of the matter of the comets'
tails. The ascent of smoke in a chimney is owing to the impulse of
the air with which it is entangled. The air rarefied by heat ascends,
because its specific gravity is diminished, and in its ascent carries
along with it the smoke with which it is engaged. And why may not the
tail of a comet rise from the sun after the same manner? for the sun's
rays do not act any way upon the mediums which they pervade but by
reflection and refraction; and those reflecting particles heated by
this action, heat the matter of the æther which is involved with them.
That matter is rarefied by the heat which it acquires, and because by
this rarefaction the specific gravity, with which it tended towards the
sun before, is diminished, it will ascend therefrom like a stream, and
carry along with it the reflecting particles of which the tail of the
comet is composed; the impulse of the sun's light, as we have said,
promoting the ascent.</p>

<p>But that the tails of comets do arise from their heads (<a href="#Page_488" class="pginternal">p. 488</a>), and
tend towards the parts opposite to the sun, is farther confirmed from
the laws which the tails observe; for, lying in the planes of the
comets' orbits which pass through the sun, they constantly deviate from
the opposition of the sun towards the parts which the comets' heads in
their progress along those orbits have left; and to a spectator placed
in those planes they appear in the parts directly opposite to the sun;
but as the spectator recedes from those planes, their deviation begins
to appear, and daily becomes greater. And the deviation, <i>cæteris
paribus</i>, appears less when the tail is more oblique to the orbit
of the comet, as well as when the head of the comet approaches nearer
to the sun; especially if the angle of deviation is estimated near the
head of the comet. Farther; the tails which have no deviation appear
straight, but the tails which deviate are likewise bended into a
certain curvature; and this curvature is greater when the deviation is
greater, and is more sensible when the tail, <i>cæteris paribus</i>,
is longer; for in the shorter tails the curvature is hardly to be
perceived. And the angle of deviation is less near the comet's head,
but greater towards the other end of the tail, and that because the
lower side of the tail regards the parts from which the deviation is
made, and which lie in a right line drawn out infinitely from the sun
through the comet's head. And the tails that are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</span> longer and broader,
and shine with a stronger light, appear more resplendent and more
exactly defined on the convex than on the concave side. Upon which
accounts it is plain that the phænomena of the tails of comets depend
upon the motions of their heads, and by no means upon the places of
the heavens in which their heads are seen; and that, therefore, the
tails of the comets do not proceed from the refraction of the heavens,
but from their own heads, which furnish the matter that forms the
tail; for as in our air the smoke of a heated body ascends either
perpendicularly, if the body is at rest, or obliquely if the body is
moved obliquely, so in the heavens, where all the bodies gravitate
towards the sun, smoke and vapour must (as we have already said) ascend
from the sun, and either rise perpendicularly, if the smoking body is
at rest, or obliquely, if the body, in the progress of its motion, is
always leaving those places from which the upper or higher parts of
the vapours had risen before. And that obliquity will be less where
the vapour ascends with more velocity, to wit, near the smoking body,
when that is near the sun; for there the force of the sun by which
the vapour ascends is stronger. But because the obliquity is varied,
the column of vapour will be incurvated; and because the vapour in
the preceding side is something more recent, that is, has ascended
something more lately from the body, it will therefore be something
more dense on that side, and must on that account reflect more light,
as well as be better defined; the vapour on the other side languishing
by degrees, and vanishing out of sight.</p>

<figure class="figleft width500" style="width: 200px;" id="i_560">
<img alt="That comets do sometimes descend below the orbit of Mercury, proved from their tails." height="213" src="images/i_560.jpg" width="200" id="img_images_i_560.jpg"></figure>

<p>But it is none of our present business to explain the causes of the
appearances of nature. Let those things which we have last said be true
or false, we have at least made out, in the preceding discourse, that
the rays of light are directly propagated from the tails of comets in
right lines through the heavens, in which those tails appear to the
spectators wherever placed; and consequently the tails must ascend
from the heads of the comets towards the parts opposite to the sun.
And from this principle we may determine anew the limits of their
distances in manner following. Let S represent the sun, T the earth,
STA the elongation of a comet from the sun, and ATB the apparent length
of its tail; and because the light is propagated from the extremity of
the tail in the direction of the right, line TB, that extremity must
lie somewhere in the line TB. Suppose it in D, and join DS cutting
TA in C. Then, because the tail is always stretched out towards the
parts nearly opposite to the sun, and therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</span> the sun, the head
of the comet, and the extremity of the tail, lie in a right line,
the comet's head will be found in C. Parallel to TB draw SA, meeting
the line TA in A, and the comet's head C must necessarily be found
between T and A, because the extremity of the tail lies somewhere in
the infinite line TB; and all the lines SD which can possibly be drawn
from the point S to the line TB must cut the line TA somewhere between
T and A. Wherefore the distance of the comet from the earth cannot
exceed the interval TA, nor its distance from the sun the interval
SA beyond, or ST on this side the sun. For instance: the elongation
of the comet of 1680 from the sun, <i>Dec. 12</i>, was 9°, and the
length of its tail 35° at least. If, therefore, a triangle TSA is
made, whose angle T is equal to the elongation 9°, and angle A equal
to ATB, or to the length of the tail, viz., 35°, then SA will be to
ST, that is, the limit of the greatest possible distance of the comet
from the sun to the semi-diameter of the <i>orbis magnus</i>, as the
sine of the angle T to the sine of the angle A, that is, as about 3
to 11. And therefore the comet at that time was less distant from the
sun than by <img alt="" data-tex="\tfrac{3}{11}" src="images/1317.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 2.595ex; height: 2.736ex;" id="img_images_1317.svg"> of the earth's distance from the sun,
and consequently either was within the orb of Mercury, or between that
orb and the earth. Again, <i>Dec. 21</i>, the elongation of the comet
from the sun was <img alt="" data-tex="32\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1318.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1318.svg"><sup>°</sup>, and the length of its tail 70°.
Wherefore as the sine of <img alt="" data-tex="32\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1318.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1318.svg_1"><sup>°</sup> to the sine of 70°, that
is, as 4 to 7, so was the limit of the comet's distance from the sun to
the distance of the earth from the sun, and consequently the comet had
not then got without the orb of Venus. <i>Dec. 28</i>, the elongation
of the comet from the sun was 55°, and the length of its tail 56°; and
therefore the limit of the comet's distance from the sun was not yet
equal to the distance of the earth from the same, and consequently the
comet had not then got without the earth's orbit. But from its parallax
we find that its egress from the orbit happened about <i>Jan. 5</i>, as
well as that it had descended far within the orbit of Mercury. Let us
suppose it to have been in its perihelion <i>Dec.</i> the 8th, when it
was in conjunction with the sun; and it will follow that in the journey
from its perihelion to its exit out of the earth's orbit it had spent
28 days; and consequently that in the 26 or 27 days following, in which
it ceased to be farther seen by the naked eye, it had scarcely doubled
its distance from the sun; and by limiting the distances of other
comets by the like arguments, we come at last to this conclusion,—that
all comets, during the time in which they are visible by us, are within
the compass of a spherical space described about the sun as a centre,
with a radius double, or at most triple, of the distance of the earth
from the sun.</p>

<p>And hence it follows that the comets, during the whole time of their
appearance unto us, being within the sphere of activity of the
circum-solar force, and therefore agitated by the impulse of that
force, will (by Cor. 1, Prop. XII, Book I, for the same reason as the
planets) be made to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</span> move in conic sections that have one focus in the
centre of the sun, and by radii drawn to the sun, to describe areas
proportional to the times; for that force is propagated to an immense
distance, and will govern the motions of bodies far beyond the orbit of
Saturn.</p>

<p>There are three hypotheses about comets (<a href="#Page_466" class="pginternal">p. 466</a>); for some will have it
that they are generated and perish as often as they appear and vanish;
others, that they come from the regions of the fixed stars, and are
seen by us in their passage through the system of our planets; and,
lastly, others, that they are bodies perpetually revolving about the
sun in very eccentric orbits. In the first case, the comets, according
to their different velocities, will move in conic sections of all
sorts; in the second, they will describe hyperbolas, and in either
of the two will frequent indifferently all quarters of the heavens,
as well those about the poles as those towards the ecliptic; in the
third, their motions will be performed in ellipses very eccentric, and
very nearly approaching to parabolas. But (if the law of the planets
is observed) their orbits will not much decline from the plane of the
ecliptic; and, so far as I could hitherto observe, the third case
obtains; for the comets do, indeed, chiefly frequent the zodiac, and
scarcely ever attain to a heliocentric latitude of 40°. And that they
move in orbits very nearly parabolical, I infer from their velocity;
for the velocity with which a parabola is described is every where to
the velocity with which a comet or planet may be revolved about the
sun in a circle at the same distance in the subduplicate ratio of 2
to 1 (by Cor. VII, Prop. XVI); and, by my computation, the velocity
of comets is found to be much about the same. I examined the thing by
inferring nearly the velocities from the distances, and the distances
both from the parallaxes and the phænomena of the tails, and never
found the errors of excess or defect in the velocities greater than
what might have arose from the errors in the distances collected after
that manner. But I likewise made use of the reasoning that follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</span></p>

<p>Supposing the radius of the <i>orbis magnus</i> to be divided into
1000 parts: let the numbers in the first column of the following table
represent the distance of the vertex of the parabola from the sun's
centre, expressed by those parts: and a comet in the times expressed
in col. 2, will pass from its perihelion to the surface of the sphere
which is described about the sun as a centre with the radius of the
<i>orbis magnus</i>; and in the times expressed in col. 3, 4, and 5, it
will double, triple, and quadruple, that its distance from the sun.</p>

<p>The ingress of a comet into the sphere of the <i>orbis magnus</i>,
or its egress from the same, happens at the time of its elongation
from the sun, expressed in col. 1, against its diurnal motion. So in
the comet of 1681, <i>Jan. 4</i>, O.S. the apparent diurnal motion
in its orbit was about 3° 5', and the corresponding elongation
<img alt="" data-tex="71\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1319.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1319.svg"><sup>°</sup>; and the comet had acquired this elongation from
the sun <i>Jan. 4</i>, about six in the evening. Again, in the year
1680, <i>Nov. 11</i>, the diurnal motion of the comet that then
appeared was about <img alt="" data-tex="4\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1320.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 2.927ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1320.svg"><sup>°</sup>; and the corresponding elongation
<img alt="" data-tex="79\tfrac{2}{3}" src="images/1321.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.816ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.773ex;" id="img_images_1321.svg"> happened <i>Nov. 10</i>, a little before midnight.
Now at the times named these comets had arrived at an equal distance
from the sun with the earth, and the earth was then almost in its
perihelion. But the first table is fitted to the earth's mean distance
from the sun assumed of 1000 parts; and this distance is greater by
such an excess of space as the earth might describe by its annual
motion in one day's time, or the comet by its motion in 16 hours. To
reduce the comet to this mean distance of 1000 parts, we add those 16
hours to the former time, and subduct them from the latter; and thus
the former becomes <i>Jan.</i> 4<sup>d</sup>. 10<sup>h</sup>. afternoon; the latter <i>Nov.
10</i>, about six in the morning. But from the tenor and progress of
the diurnal motions it appears that both comets were in conjunction
with the sun between <i>Dec. 7</i> and <i>Dec. 8</i>; and from thence
to <i>Jan. 4<sup>d</sup>.</i> 10<sup>h</sup>. afternoon on one side, and to <i>Nov.</i>
10<sup>d</sup>. 6<sup>h</sup>. of the morning on the other, there are about 28 days. And so
many days (by Table 1) the motions in parabolic trajectories do require.</p>

<p>But though we have hitherto considered those comets as two, yet, from
the coincidence of their perihelions and agreement of their velocities,
it is probable that in effect they were but one and the same; and if
so, the orbit of this comet must have either been a parabola, or at
least a conic section very little differing from a parabola, and at
its vertex almost in contact with the surface of the sun. For (by
Tab. 2) the distance of the comet from the earth, <i>Nov. 10</i>, was
about 360 parts, and <i>Jan. 4</i>, about 630. From which distances,
together with its longitudes and latitudes, we infer the distance of
the places in which the comet was at those times to have been about
280: the half of which, viz., 140, is an ordinate to the comet's orbit,
cutting off a portion of its axis nearly equal to the radius of the
<i>orbis magnus</i>, that is, to 1000 parts. And, therefore, dividing
the square of the ordinate 140 by 1000, the segment of the axis, we
find the <i>latus rectum</i> 19, 16, or in a round number 20; the
fourth part whereof, 5, is the distance of the vertex of the orbit
from the sun's centre. But the time corresponding to the distance of 5
parts in Tab. 1 is 27<sup>d</sup>. 16<sup>h</sup>. 7'. In which time, if the comet moved
in a parabolic orbit, it would have been carried from its perihelion
to the surface of the sphere of the <i>orbis magnus</i> described with
the radius 1000, and would have spent the double of that, time, viz.,
55<sup>d</sup>. <img alt="" data-tex="8\tfrac{1}{4}^{h}." src="images/1227.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.23ex;" id="img_images_1227.svg_1"> in the whole course of its motion within
that sphere: and so in fact it did; for from <i>Nov.</i> 10<sup>d</sup>. 6<sup>h</sup>. of
the morning, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</span> time of the comet's ingress into the sphere of the
<i>orbis magnus</i>, to <i>Jan.</i> 4<sup>d</sup>. 10<sup>h</sup>. afternoon, the time of
its egress from the same, there are 55<sup>d</sup>. 16<sup>h</sup>. The small difference of
<img alt="" data-tex="7\tfrac{3}{4}^{h}." src="images/1322.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.665ex; height: 3.229ex;" id="img_images_1322.svg"> in this rude way of computing is to be neglected,
and perhaps may arise from the comet's motion being some small matter
slower, as it must have been if the true orbit in which it was carried
was an ellipsis. The middle time between its ingress and egress was
<i>December</i> 8<sup>d</sup>. 2<sup>h</sup>. of the morning; and therefore at this time
the comet ought to have been in its perihelion. And accordingly that
very day, just before sunrising, Dr. <i>Halley</i> (as we said) saw the
tail short and broad, but very bright, rising perpendicularly from the
horizon. From the position of the tail it is certain that the comet
had then crossed over the ecliptic, and got into north latitude, and
therefore had passed by its perihelion, which lay on the other side
of the ecliptic, though it had not yet come into conjunction with the
sun; and the comet [see more of this famous comet, <a href="#Page_475" class="pginternal">p. 475</a> to <a href="#Page_486" class="pginternal">486</a>] being
at this time between its perihelion and its conjunction with the sun,
must have been in its perihelion a few hours before; for in so near a
distance from the sun it must have been carried with great velocity,
and have apparently described almost half a degree every hour.</p>

<p>By like computations I find that the comet of 1618 entered the sphere
of the <i>orbis magnus</i> <i>December 7</i>, towards sun-setting; but
its conjunction with the sun was <i>Nov. 9</i>, or 10, about 28 days
intervening, as in the preceding comet; for from the size of the tail
of this, in which it was equal to the preceding, it is probable that
this comet likewise did come almost into a contact with the sun. Four
comets were seen that year of which this was the last. The second,
which made its first appearance <i>October 31</i>, in the neighbourhood
of the rising sun, and was soon after hid under the sun's rays, I
suspect to have been the same with the fourth, which emerged out of the
sun's rays about <i>Nov. 9</i>. To these we may add the comet of 1607,
which entered the sphere of the <i>orbis magnus Sept. 14</i>, O.S.
and arrived at its perihelion distance from the sun about <i>October
19</i>, 35 days intervening. Its perihelion distance subtended an
apparent angle at the earth of about 23 degrees, and was therefore of
390 parts. And to this number of parts about 34 days correspond in
Tab. 1. Farther; the comet of 1665 entered the sphere of the <i>orbis
magnus</i> about <i>March 17</i>, and came to its perihelion about
<i>April 16</i>, 30 days intervening. Its perihelion distance subtended
an angle at the earth of about seven degrees, and therefore was of 122
parts: and corresponding to this number of parts, in Tab. 1, we find
30 days. Again; the comet of 1682 entered the sphere of the <i>orbis
magnus</i> about <i>Aug. 11</i>, and arrived at its perihelion about
<i>Sep. 16</i>, being then distant from the sun by about 350 parts,
to which, in Tab. 1, belong <img alt="" data-tex="33\tfrac{1}{2}" src="images/1323.svg" style="vertical-align: -0.781ex; width: 4.058ex; height: 2.737ex;" id="img_images_1323.svg"> days. Lastly; that
memorable comet of <i>Regiomontanus</i>, which in 1472 was carried
through the circum-polar parts of our northern hemisphere with such
rapidity as to describe 40<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</span> degrees in one day, entered the sphere
of the <i>orbis magnus</i> <i>Jan 21</i>, about the time that it was
passing by the pole, and, hastening from thence towards the sun, was
hid under the sun's rays about the end of <i>Feb.</i>, whence it is
probable that 30 days, or a few more, were spent between its ingress
into the sphere of the <i>orbis magnus</i> and its perihelion. Nor did
this comet truly move with more velocity than other comets, but owed
the greatness of its apparent velocity to its passing by the earth at a
near distance.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the velocity of comets (<a href="#Page_471" class="pginternal">p. 471</a>), so far as
it can be determined by these rude ways of computing, is that very
velocity with which parabolas, or ellipses near to parabolas, ought
to be described; and therefore the distance between a comet and the
sun being given, the velocity of the comet is nearly given. And hence
arises this problem.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2">PROBLEM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The relation betwixt the velocity of a comet and its distance from
the sun's centre being given, the comet's trajectory is required.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</span></p>

<p>If this problem was resolved, we should thence have a method of
determining the trajectories of comets to the greatest accuracy; for
if that relation be twice assumed, and from thence the trajectory
be twice computed, and the error of each trajectory be found from
observations, the assumption may be corrected by the Rule of False, and
a third trajectory may thence be found that will exactly agree with
the observations. And by determining the trajectories of comets after
this method, we may come, at last, to a more exact knowledge of the
parts through which those bodies travel, of the velocities with which
they are carried, what sort of trajectories they describe, and what are
the true magnitudes and forms of their tails according to the various
distances of their heads from the sun; whether, after certain intervals
of time, the same comets do return again, and in what periods they
complete their several revolutions. But the problem may be resolved by
determining, first, the hourly motion of a comet to a given time from
three or more observations, and then deriving the trajectory from this
motion. And thus the invention of the trajectory, depending on one
observation, and its hourly motion at the time of this observation,
will either confirm or disprove itself; for the conclusion that is
drawn from the motion only of an hour or two and a false hypothesis,
will never agree with the motions of the comets from beginning to end.
The method of the whole computation is this.</p>

<p>From observations of the best credit, let three longitudes of the
comet be given, and, supposing ATR, RTB, to be their differences, let
the hourly motion be required to the time of the middle observation
TR. By <i>Lem.</i> II, draw the right line ARB, so as its intercepted
parts AR, RB, may be as the times between the observations; and if we
suppose a body in the whole time to describe the whole line AB with an
equal motion, and to be in the mean time viewed from the place T, the
apparent motion of that body about the point R will be nearly the same
with that of the comet at the time of the observation TR.</p>


<p class="nindc space-above2"><i>The same more accurately.</i></p>

<p>Let T<i>a</i>, T<i>b</i>, be two longitudes given at a greater distance

<i>a</i>R<i>b</i> so as its intercepted parts <i>a</i>R, R<i>b</i>
may be as the times between the observations <i>a</i>TR, RT<i>b</i>.
Suppose this to cut the lines TA, TB, in D and E; and because the error
of the inclination TR<i>a</i> increases nearly in the duplicate ratio
of the time between the observations, draw FRG, so as either the angle
DRF may be to the angle ARF, or the line DF to the line AF, in the
duplicate ratio of the whole time between the observations <i>a</i>TB
to the whole time between the observations ATB, and use the line thus
found FG in place of the line AB found above.</p>

<p>It will be convenient that the angles ATR, RTB, <i>a</i>TA, BT<i>b</i>,
be no less than of ten or fifteen degrees, the times corresponding no
greater than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</span> of eight or twelve days, and the longitudes taken when
the comet moves with the greatest velocity; for thus the errors of
the observation will bear a less proportion to the differences of the

by comparing the variation of the error with the variation of the
other quantities, we may conclude, by the Rule of Three, how far those
other quantities ought to be varied or corrected, so as the error may
become as small as possible. And by means of these corrections we may
have the trajectory exactly, providing the observations upon which the
computation was founded were exact, and that we did not err much in the
assumption of the quantity V; for if we did, the operation is to be
repeated till the trajectory is exactly enough determined. Q.E.F.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div class="agate">PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
</div><div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works
</div><div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div><div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div><div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div><div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div></blockquote><div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div><div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div><div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div><div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div><ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul><div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div><div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
