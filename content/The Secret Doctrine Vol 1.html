<span style="font-size: 173%">Preface To The First
        Edition.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author—the
        writer, rather—feels it necessary to apologize for the long delay
        which has occurred in the appearance of this work. It has been
        occasioned by ill-health and the magnitude of the undertaking. Even
        the two volumes now issued do not complete the scheme, nor do these
        treat exhaustively of the subjects dealt with in them. A large
        quantity of material has already been prepared, dealing with the
        history of Occultism as contained in the lives of the great Adepts of
        the Âryan Race, and showing the bearing of Occult Philosophy upon the
        conduct of life, as it is and as it ought to be. Should the present
        volumes meet with a favourable reception, no effort will be spared to
        carry out the scheme of the work in its entirety.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This scheme, it
        must be added, was not in contemplation when the preparation of the
        work was first announced. As originally announced, it was intended
        that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
        Secret Doctrine</span></span> should be an amended and enlarged
        version of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>. It was, however,
        soon found that the explanations which could be added to those
        already put before the world, in the last-named and other works
        dealing with Esoteric Science, were such as to require a different
        method of treatment; and consequently the present volumes do not
        contain, in all, twenty pages extracted from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
        Unveiled</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author does
        not feel it necessary to ask the indulgence of her readers and
        critics for the many defects of literary style, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexx">[pg xx]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxx"></a> imperfect English which may be found in
        these pages. She is a foreigner, and her knowledge of the language
        was acquired late in life. The English tongue is employed because it
        offers the most widely-diffused medium for conveying the truths which
        it had become her duty to place before the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These truths are
        in no sense put forward as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">revelation</span></em>; nor does the author
        claim the position of a revealer of mystic lore, now made public for
        the first time in the world's history. For what is contained in this
        work is to be found scattered throughout thousands of volumes
        embodying the Scriptures of the great Asiatic and early European
        religions, hidden under glyph and symbol, and hitherto left unnoticed
        because of this veil. What is now attempted is to gather the oldest
        tenets together and to make of them one harmonious and unbroken
        whole. The sole advantage which the writer has over her predecessors,
        is that she need not resort to personal speculations and theories.
        For this work is a partial statement of what she herself has been
        taught by more advanced students, supplemented, in a few details
        only, by the results of her own study and observation. The
        publication of many of the facts herein stated has been rendered
        necessary by the wild and fanciful speculations in which many
        Theosophists and students of Mysticism have indulged, during the last
        few years, in their endeavour, as they imagined, to work out a
        complete system of thought from the few facts previously communicated
        to them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless to
        explain that this book is not the Secret Doctrine in its entirety,
        but a select number of fragments of its fundamental tenets, special
        attention being paid to some facts which have been seized upon by
        various writers, and distorted out of all resemblance to the
        truth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is perhaps
        desirable to state unequivocally that the teachings, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxi">[pg xxi]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxi"></a> however fragmentary and incomplete,
        contained in these volumes, do not belong to the Hindû, the
        Zoroastrian, the Chaldæan, or the Egyptian religion, nor to Buddhism,
        Islam, Judaism or Christianity exclusively. The Secret Doctrine is
        the essence of all these. Sprung from it in their origins, the
        various religious schemes are now made to merge back into their
        original element, out of which every mystery and dogma has grown,
        developed, and become materialized.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is more than
        probable that the book will be regarded by a large section of the
        public as a romance of the wildest kind; for who has ever even heard
        of the Book of Dzyan?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer,
        therefore, is fully prepared to take all the responsibility for what
        is contained in this work, and even to face the charge of having
        invented the whole of it. That it has many shortcomings she is fully
        aware; all that she claims for it is that, romantic as it may seem to
        many, its logical coherence and consistency entitle this new Genesis
        to rank, at any rate, on a level with the <span class="tei tei-q">“working hypotheses”</span> so freely accepted by Modern
        Science. Further, it claims consideration, not by reason of any
        appeal to dogmatic authority, but because it closely adheres to
        Nature, and follows the laws of uniformity and analogy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aim of this
        work may be thus stated: to show that Nature is not <span class="tei tei-q">“a fortuitous concurrence of atoms,”</span> and to assign
        to man his rightful place in the scheme of the Universe; to rescue
        from degradation the archaic truths which are the basis of all
        religions; to uncover, to some extent, the fundamental unity from
        which they all spring; finally, to show that the Occult side of
        Nature has never been approached by the Science of modern
        civilization.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this is in any
        degree accomplished, the writer is content. It is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexxii">[pg xxii]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pgxxii"></a> written in the service of
        humanity, and by humanity and the future generations it must be
        judged. Its author recognizes no inferior court of appeal. Abuse she
        is accustomed to; calumny she is daily acquainted with; at slander
        she smiles in silent contempt.</p>

        Edition.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In preparing this
        edition for the press, we have striven to correct minor points of
        detail in literary form, without touching at all more important
        matters. Had H. P. Blavatsky lived to issue the new edition, she
        would doubtless have corrected and enlarged it to a very considerable
        extent. That this is not done is one of the many minor losses caused
        by the one great loss.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Awkward phrases,
        due to imperfect knowledge of English, have been corrected; most of
        the quotations have been verified, and exact references given—a work
        involving great labour, as the references in the previous editions
        were often very loose; a uniform system of transliteration for
        Sanskrit words has been adopted. Rejecting the form most favoured by
        Western Orientalists as being misleading to the general reader—we
        have given to the consonants not present in our English alphabet
        combinations that approximately express their sound-values, and we
        have carefully inserted quantities, wherever they occur, on the
        vowels. In a few instances we have incorporated notes in the text,
        but this has been very sparingly done, and only when they obviously
        formed part of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have added a
        copious Index for the assistance of students, and have bound it
        separately, so that reference to it may be facilitated. For the great
        labour in this we, and all students, are the debtors of Mr. A. J.
        Faulding.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the
        appearance of Theosophical literature in England, it has become
        customary to call its teachings <span class="tei tei-q">“Esoteric
        Buddhism.”</span> And, having become a habit—as an old proverb based
        on daily experience has it—<span class="tei tei-q">“Error runs down
        an inclined plane, while Truth has to laboriously climb its way up
        hill.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Old truisms are
        often the wisest. The human mind can hardly remain entirely free from
        bias, and decisive opinions are often formed before a thorough
        examination of a subject from all its aspects has been made. This is
        said with reference to the prevailing double mistake (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) of
        limiting Theosophy to Buddhism; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) of
        confounding the tenets of the religious philosophy preached by
        Gautama, the Buddha, with the doctrines broadly outlined in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
        Buddhism</span></span>. Any thing more erroneous than this could
        hardly be imagined. It has enabled our enemies to find an effective
        weapon against Theosophy, because, as an eminent Pâli scholar very
        pointedly expressed it, there was in the volume named <span class="tei tei-q">“neither Esotericism nor Buddhism.”</span> The esoteric
        truths, presented in Mr. Sinnett's work, ceased to be esoteric from
        the moment they were made public; nor did the book contain the
        religion of Buddha, but simply a few tenets from a hitherto hidden
        teaching, which are now explained and supplemented by many more in
        the present volumes. And even the latter, though giving out many
        fundamental tenets from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Secret Doctrine</span></span> of the East,
        raise but a small corner of the dark veil. For no one, not even the
        greatest living Adept, would be permitted to, or could—even if he
        would—give out promiscuously to a mocking, unbelieving world that
        which has been so effectually concealed from it for long æons and
        ages.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
        Buddhism</span></span> was an excellent work with a very unfortunate
        title, though it meant no more than does the title of this work,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg002"></a><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Secret
        Doctrine</span></span>. It proved unfortunate, because people are
        always in the habit of judging things by their appearance rather than
        by their meaning, and because the error has now become so universal,
        that even most of the Fellows of the Theosophical Society have fallen
        victims to the same misconception. From the first, however, protests
        were raised by Brâhmans and others against the title; and, in justice
        to myself, I must add that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span> was presented to
        me as a completed volume, and that I was entirely unaware of the
        manner in which the author intended to spell the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Budh-ism.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This has to be
        laid directly at the door of those who, having been the first to
        bring the subject under public notice, neglected to point out the
        difference between <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhism”</span>—the
        religious system of ethics preached by the Lord Gautama, and so named
        from his title of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddha</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Enlightened”</span>—and <span class="tei tei-q">“Budhism,”</span> from <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Budha</span></span>, Wisdom, or Knowledge
        (Vidyâ), the faculty of cognizing, from the Sanskrit root
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Budh</span></span>, to know. We Theosophists of
        India are ourselves the real culprits, although, at the time, we did
        our best to correct the mistake.<a href="#note_1" id="noteref_1" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> To avoid
        this deplorable misnomer was easy; the spelling of the word had only
        to be altered, and by common consent both pronounced and written
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Budhism,”</span> instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhism.”</span> Nor is the latter term correctly spelt
        and pronounced, as it ought to be called, in English, Buddhaïsm, and
        its votaries <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhaïsts.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This explanation
        is absolutely necessary at the beginning of a work like the present.
        The Wisdom-Religion is the inheritance of all the nations, the world
        over, in spite of the statement made in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
        Buddhism</span></span><a href="#note_2" id="noteref_2" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“two years ago (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in
        1883), neither I, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nor any other European living</span></em>, knew
        the alphabet of the Science, here for the first time put into a
        scientific shape,”</span> etc. This error must have crept in through
        inadvertence. The present writer knew all that is <span class="tei tei-q">“divulged”</span> in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
        Buddhism</span></span>, and much more, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many
        years</span></em> before it became her duty (in 1880) to impart a
        small portion of the Secret Doctrine to two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">European</span></em>
        gentlemen, one of whom was the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
        Buddhism</span></span>; and surely the present writer has the
        undoubted, though to her, rather equivocal, privilege of being a
        European by birth and education. Moreover, a considerable part of the
        philosophy expounded by Mr. Sinnett was taught in America, even
        before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
        Unveiled</span></span> was published, to two Europeans and to my
        colleague, Colonel H. S. Olcott. Of the three teachers the latter
        gentleman has had, the first was a Hungarian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg003"></a> Initiate, the second an Egyptian, the third a
        Hindû. As permitted, Colonel Olcott has given out some of this
        teaching in various ways; if the other two have not, it has been
        simply because they were not allowed, their time for public work
        having not yet come. But for others it has, and the appearance of Mr.
        Sinnett's several interesting books is a visible proof of the fact.
        Moreover, it is above everything important to keep in mind that no
        Theosophical book acquires the least additional value from pretended
        authority.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Âdi, or Âdhi
        Budha, the One, or the First, and Supreme Wisdom, is a term used by
        Âryâsanga in his secret treatises, and now by all the mystic Northern
        Buddhists. It is a Sanskrit term, and an appellation given by the
        earliest Âryans to the Unknown Deity; the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Brahmâ”</span> not being found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> and
        the early works. It means the Absolute Wisdom, and Âdibhûta is
        translated by Fitzedward Hall, <span class="tei tei-q">“the primeval
        uncreated cause of all.”</span> Æons of untold duration must have
        elapsed, before the epithet of Buddha was so humanized, so to speak,
        as to allow of the term being applied to mortals, and finally
        appropriated to one whose unparalleled virtues and knowledge caused
        him to receive the title of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddha of
        Wisdom Unmoved.”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bodha</span></span> means the innate possession
        of divine intellect or understanding; <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddha</span></span>, the acquirement of it by
        personal efforts and merit; while <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddhi</span></span> is the faculty of
        cognizing, the channel through which divine knowledge reaches the
        Ego, the discernment of good and evil, also divine conscience, and
        the Spiritual Soul, which is the vehicle of Âtmâ. <span class="tei tei-q">“When Buddhi absorbs our Ego-tism (destroys it) with all
        its Vikâras, Avalokiteshvara becomes manifested to us, and Nirvâna,
        or Mukti, is reached,”</span> Mukti being the same as Nirvana,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, freedom from the trammels of
        Mâyâ or Illusion. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bodhi</span></span> is likewise the name of a
        particular state of trance-condition, called Samâdhi, during which
        the subject reaches the culmination of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unwise are those
        who, in their blind and, in our age, untimely hatred of Buddhism,
        and, by reäction, of Budhism, deny its esoteric teachings, which are
        those also of the Brâhmans, simply because the name suggests what to
        them, as Monotheists, are noxious doctrines. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Unwise</span></em> is
        the correct term to use in their case. For in this age of crass and
        illogical materialism, the Esoteric Philosophy alone is calculated to
        withstand the repeated attacks on all and everything man holds most
        dear and sacred in his inner spiritual life. The true philosopher,
        the student of Esoteric Wisdom, entirely loses sight of
        personalities, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
        004]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg004"></a>
        dogmatic beliefs and special religions. Moreover, Esoteric Philosophy
        reconciles all religions, strips every one of its outward human
        garments, and shows the root of each to be identical with that of
        every other great religion. It proves the necessity of a Divine
        Absolute Principle in Nature. It denies Deity no more than it does
        the sun. Esoteric Philosophy has never rejected God in Nature, nor
        Deity as the absolute and abstract <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ens</span></span>.
        It only refuses to accept any of the gods of the so-called
        monotheistic religions, gods created by man in his own image and
        likeness, a blasphemous and sorry caricature of the Ever-Unknowable.
        Furthermore, the records we mean to place before the reader embrace
        the esoteric tenets of the whole world since the beginning of our
        humanity, and Buddhistic Occultism occupies therein only its
        legitimate place, and no more. Indeed, the secret portions of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dan</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Janna</span></span>
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dhyâna</span></span>)<a href="#note_3" id="noteref_3" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a> of
        Gautama's metaphysics—grand as they appear to one unacquainted with
        the tenets of the Wisdom-Religion of antiquity—are but a very small
        portion of the whole. The Hindû reformer limited his public teachings
        to the purely moral and physiological aspect of the Wisdom-Religion,
        to ethics and man alone. Things <span class="tei tei-q">“unseen and
        incorporeal,”</span> the mysteries of Being outside our terrestrial
        sphere, the great Teacher left entirely untouched in his public
        lectures, reserving the Hidden Truths for a select circle of his
        Arhats. The latter received their Initiation at the famous Saptaparna
        Cave (the Sattapanni of Mahâvansa) near Mount Baibhâr (the Webhâra of
        the Pâli MSS.). This cave was in Râjâgriha, the ancient capital of
        Magadha, and was the Cheta Cave of Fa-hian, as is rightly suspected
        by some archaeologists.<a href="#note_4" id="noteref_4" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time and human
        imagination made short work of the purity and philosophy of these
        teachings, once that they were transplanted from the secret and
        sacred circle of the Arhats, during the course of their work of
        proselytism, into a soil less prepared for metaphysical conceptions
        than India; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, once they were transferred
        into China, Japan, Siam, and Burmah. How the pristine purity of these
        grand revelations was dealt with may be seen in studying some of the
        so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“esoteric”</span> Buddhist schools
        of antiquity in their modern garb, not only in China <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg005"></a> and other Buddhist countries in general,
        but even in not a few schools of Tibet, which have been left to the
        care of uninitiated Lamas and Mongolian innovators.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the reader is
        asked to bear in mind the very important difference between
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orthodox</span></em> Buddhism—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the
        public teachings of Gautama, the Buddha—and his esoteric Budhism. His
        Secret Doctrine, however, differed in no wise from that of the
        initiated Brahmans of his day. The Buddha was a child of Âryan soil,
        a born Hindû, a Kshatriya and a disciple of the Twice-born (the
        initiated Brâhmans) or Dvîjas. His teachings, therefore, could not be
        different from their doctrines, for the whole Buddhist reform
        consisted merely in giving out a portion of that which had been kept
        secret from every man outside of the <span class="tei tei-q">“enchanted”</span> circle of ascetics and
        Temple-Initiates. Unable, owing to his pledges, to teach <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> that
        had been imparted to him, though the Buddha taught a philosophy built
        upon the ground-work of the true esoteric knowledge, he gave to the
        world only its outward material body and kept its soul for his Elect.
        Many Chinese scholars among Orientalists have heard of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul-Doctrine.”</span> None seem to have
        understood its real meaning and importance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That doctrine was
        preserved secretly—too secretly, perhaps—within the sanctuary. The
        mystery that shrouded its chief dogma and aspiration—Nirvâna—has so
        tried and irritated the curiosity of those scholars who have studied
        it, that, unable to solve it logically and satisfactorily by untying
        its Gordian knot, they have cut it through by declaring that Nirvâna
        means <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute annihilation</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Toward the end of
        the first quarter of this century a distinct class of literature
        appeared in the world, which with every year became more defined in
        its tendency. Being based, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">soi-disant</span></span>, on the scholarly
        researches of Sanskritists and Orientalists in general, it was
        considered scientific. Hindû, Egyptian, and other ancient religions,
        myths, and emblems were made to yield anything the symbologist wanted
        them to yield, and thus often the rude <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outward</span></em>
        form was given out in place of the inner meaning. Works, most
        remarkable for their ingenious deductions and speculations,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">circulo vicioso</span></span>—foregone
        conclusions generally taking the place of premisses in the syllogisms
        of more than one Sanskrit and Pâli scholar—appeared rapidly in
        succession, over-flooding the libraries with dissertations on phallic
        and sexual worship rather than on real symbology, and each
        contradicting the other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the true
        reason, perhaps, why the outline of a few fundamental <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg006"></a> truths from the Secret Doctrine of the
        Archaic Ages is now permitted to see the light, after long
        millenniums of the most profound silence and secrecy. I say advisedly
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">few</span></em> truths,”</span> because that
        which must remain unsaid could not be contained in a hundred such
        volumes, nor could it be imparted to the present generation of
        Sadducees. But even the little that is now given is better than
        complete silence upon these vital truths. The world of to-day, in its
        mad career towards the unknown, which the Physicist is too ready to
        confound with the unknowable, whenever the problem eludes his grasp,
        is rapidly progressing on the reverse plane to that of spirituality.
        It has now become a vast arena, a true valley of discord and of
        eternal strife, a necropolis, wherein lie buried the highest and the
        most holy aspirations of our Spirit-Soul. That soul becomes with
        every new generation more paralyzed and atrophied. The <span class="tei tei-q">“amiable infidels and accomplished profligates”</span> of
        Society, spoken of by Greeley, care little for the revival of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead</span></em> sciences of the past; but there
        is a fair minority of earnest students who are entitled to learn the
        few truths that may be given to them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>; and
        now much more than ten years ago, when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
        Unveiled</span></span> appeared, or even when the later attempts to
        explain the mysteries of esoteric science were published.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
        greatest and perhaps the most serious objection to the correctness
        and reliability of the whole work will be the preliminary Stanzas.
        How can the statements contained in them be verified? True, though a
        great portion of the Sanskrit, Chinese, and Mongolian works quoted in
        the present volumes is known to some Orientalists, yet the chief
        work—that one from which the Stanzas are given—is not in the
        possession of European Libraries. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Book of
        Dzyan</span></span> (or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dzan</span></span>) is utterly unknown to
        our Philologists, or at any rate was never heard of by them under its
        present name. This is, of course, a great drawback to those who
        follow the methods of research prescribed by official Science; but to
        students of Occultism, and to every genuine Occultist, this will be
        of little moment. The main body of the doctrines given, however, is
        found scattered throughout hundreds and thousands of Sanskrit MSS.,
        some already translated—disfigured in their interpretations, as
        usual—others still waiting their turn. Every scholar, therefore, has
        an opportunity of verifying the statements herein made, and of
        checking most of the quotations. A few new facts, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new</span></em> to
        the profane Orientalist only, and passages quoted from the
        Commentaries will be found difficult to trace. Several of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg007"></a> teachings also have hitherto
        been transmitted orally, yet even these in every instance are hinted
        at in the almost countless volumes of Brâhmanical, Chinese and
        Tibetan temple-literature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However it may be,
        and whatsoever is in store for the writer through malevolent
        criticism, one fact is quite certain. The members of several esoteric
        schools—the seat of which is beyond the Himâlayas, and whose
        ramifications may be found in China, Japan, India, Tibet, and even in
        Syria, and also South America—claim to have in their possession the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sum
        total</span></em> of sacred and philosophical works in MSS. and
        print, all the works, in fact, that have ever been written, in
        whatever language or character, since the art of writing began, from
        the ideographic hieroglyphs down to the alphabet of Cadmus and the
        Devanâgari.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        constantly claimed that, ever since the destruction of the
        Alexandrian Library,<a href="#note_5" id="noteref_5" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a> every
        work of a character that might lead the profane to the ultimate
        discovery and comprehension of some of the mysteries of the Secret
        Science, owing to the combined efforts of the members of these
        Brotherhoods, has been diligently searched for. It is added,
        moreover, by those who know, that once found all such works were
        destroyed, save three copies of each which were preserved and safely
        stored away. In India, the last of these precious manuscripts were
        secured and hidden during the reign of the Emperor Akbar.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prof. Max Müller
        shows that no bribes or threats of Akbar could extort the original
        text of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> from the Brâhmans, and yet
        boasts that European Orientalists have it.<a href="#note_6" id="noteref_6" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a> That
        Europe has the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete text</span></em> is exceedingly
        doubtful, and the future may have very disagreeable surprises in
        store for the Orientalists.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is maintained,
        furthermore, that every sacred book of this kind, the text of which
        was not sufficiently veiled in symbolism, or which had any direct
        references to the ancient mysteries, was first carefully copied in
        cryptographic characters, such as to defy the art of the best and
        cleverest palæographer, and then destroyed to the last copy. During
        Akbar's reign, some fanatical courtiers, displeased at the Emperor's
        sinful prying into the religions of the infidels, themselves helped
        the Brâhmans to conceal their MSS. Such was Badáoní, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg008"></a> who had an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">undisguised
        horror</span></em> of Akbar's mania for idolatrous religions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Badáoní, in his
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Muntakhab</span></span> at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tawarikh</span></span>,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover in all
        the large and wealthy Lamasaries, there are subterranean crypts and
        cave-libraries, cut in the rock, whenever the Gonpa and Lhakhang are
        situated in the mountains. Beyond the Western Tsaydam, in the
        solitary passes of Kuen-lun there are several such hiding-places.
        Along the ridge of Altyn-tag, whose soil no European foot has ever
        trodden so far, there exists a certain hamlet, lost in a deep gorge.
        It is a small cluster of houses, a hamlet rather than a monastery,
        with a poor-looking temple in it, and one old Lama, a hermit, living
        near by to watch it. Pilgrims say that the subterranean galleries and
        halls under it contain a collection of books, the number of which,
        according to the accounts given, is too large to find room even in
        the British Museum.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        same tradition the now desolate regions of the waterless land of
        Tarim—a veritable wilderness in the heart of Turkestan—were in days
        of old covered with flourishing and wealthy cities. At present, a few
        verdant oases only relieve its dread solitude. One such, carpeting
        the sepulchre of a vast city buried under the sandy soil of the
        desert, belongs to no one, but is often visited by Mongolians and
        Buddhists. The tradition also speaks of immense subterranean abodes,
        of large corridors filled with tiles and cylinders. It may be an idle
        rumour, and it may be an actual fact.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this will very
        likely provoke a smile of doubt. But before the reader rejects the
        truthfulness of the reports, let him pause and reflect over the
        following well-known facts. The collective researches of
        Orientalists, and especially of late years the labours of students of
        Comparative Philology and the Science of Religion, have enabled them
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg009"></a> to ascertain that an
        incalculable number of MSS., and even of printed works <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known to have
        existed, are now to be no more found</span></em>. They have
        disappeared without leaving the slightest trace behind them. Were
        they works of no importance they might, in the natural course of
        time, have been left to perish, and their very names would have been
        obliterated from human memory. But this is not so, for, as now
        ascertained, most of them contained the true keys to works still
        extant, and now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entirely incomprehensible</span></em>, for the
        greater portion of their readers, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">without these
        additional volumes of commentaries and
        explanations</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, for
        instance, are the works of Lao-tse, the predecessor of Confucius. He
        is said to have written nine hundred and thirty books on ethics and
        religions, and seventy on magic, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one
        thousand</span></em> in all. His great work, however, the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tao-te-King</span></span>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heart</span></em> of
        his doctrine and the sacred scripture of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tao-sse</span></span>,
        has in it, as Stanislas Julien shows, only <span class="tei tei-q">“about 5,000 words,”</span><a href="#note_8" id="noteref_8" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> hardly a
        dozen of pages; yet Professor Max Müller finds that <span class="tei tei-q">“the text is unintelligible without commentaries, so that
        M. Julien had to consult more than sixty commentators for the purpose
        of his translation, the earliest going back as far as the year 163
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>”</span>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not
        earlier</span></em>, as we see. During the four centuries and a half
        that preceded this <span class="tei tei-q">“earliest”</span> of the
        commentators there was ample time to veil the true Lao-tse doctrine
        from all but his initiated priests. The Japanese, among whom are now
        to be found the most learned of the priests and followers of Lao-tse,

        scholars; and tradition affirms that the commentaries to which our
        Western Sinologues have access are not the real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occult</span></em>
        records, but intentional veils, and that the true commentaries, as
        well as almost all the texts, have long <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disappeared</span></em> from the eyes of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If our scholars
        turn to the ancient literature of the Semitic religions, to the
        Scriptures of Chaldea, the elder sister and instructress, if not the
        fountain-head of the Mosaic Bible, the basis and starting-point of
        Christianity, what do they find? To perpetuate the memory of the
        ancient religions of Babylon, to record the vast cycle of
        astronomical observations of the Chaldean Magi, to justify the
        tradition of their splendid and preëminently occult literature, what
        now remains? Only a few fragments, which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">said to
        be</span></em> by Berosus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These, however,
        are almost valueless, even as a clue to the character of what has
        disappeared, for they passed through the hands of his Reverence, the
        Bishop of Cæsarea—that self-constituted censor and editor of the
        sacred records of other men's religions—and they doubtless to this
        day bear the mark of his eminently veracious and trustworthy hand.
        For what is the history of this treatise on the once grand religion
        of Babylon?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was written in
        Greek for Alexander the Great, by Berosus, a priest of the temple of
        Belus, from the astronomical and chronological records preserved by
        the priests of that temple—records covering a period of 200,000
        years—and is now lost. In the first century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Alexander Polyhistor
        made a series of extracts from it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which are also
        lost</span></em>. Eusebius (270-340 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>) used these extracts in
        writing his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chronicon</span></span>. The points of
        resemblance—almost of identity—between the Jewish and the Chaldean
        scriptures,<a href="#note_10" id="noteref_10" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> made the
        latter most dangerous to Eusebius, in his <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rôle</span></span>
        of defender and champion of the new faith which had adopted the
        former scriptures and together with them an absurd chronology.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is pretty
        certain that Eusebius did not spare the Egyptian synchronistic tables
        of Manetho—so much so that Bunsen<a href="#note_11" id="noteref_11" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> charges
        him with mutilating history most unscrupulously, and Socrates, a
        historian of the fifth century, and Syncellus, vice-patriarch of
        Constantinople in the beginning of the eighth, denounce him as the
        most daring and desperate forger. Is it likely, then, that he dealt
        more tenderly with the Chaldean records, which were already menacing
        the new religion, so rashly accepted?</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg011"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So that, with the
        exception of these more than doubtful fragments, the entire Chaldean
        sacred literature has disappeared from the eyes of the profane as
        completely as the lost Atlantis. A few facts that were contained in
        the Berosian History are given later on, and may throw great light on
        the true origin of the Fallen Angels, personified by Bel and the
        Dragon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Turning now to the
        oldest specimen of Âryan literature, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>,
        the student if he strictly follows in this the data furnished by the
        Orientalists themselves, will find that although the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>
        contains only about 10,580 verses, or 1,028 hymns, yet in spite of
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span> and the mass of glosses
        and commentaries, it is not understood correctly to this day. Why is
        this so? Evidently because the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the scholastic and oldest treatises on the primitive
        hymns,”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">themselves require a key</span></em>, which the
        Orientalists have failed to secure.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, again, do
        the scholars say of Buddhist literature? Do they possess it in its
        completeness? Assuredly not. Notwithstanding the 325 volumes of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kanjur</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tanjur</span></span> of
        the Northern Buddhists, each volume, we are told, <span class="tei tei-q">“weighing from four to five pounds,”</span> nothing, in
        truth, is known of real Lamaïsm. Yet the sacred canon is said in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saddharmâlankâra</span></span><a href="#note_12" id="noteref_12" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> to
        contain 29,368,000 letters, or, exclusive of treatises and
        commentaries, five or six times the amount of the matter contained in
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, which, as Professor Max
        Müller states, rejoices in only 3,567,180 letters. Notwithstanding,
        then, these 325 volumes (in reality there are 333, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kanjur</span></span>
        comprising 108, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tanjur</span></span> 225 volumes), <span class="tei tei-q">“the translators, instead of supplying us with correct
        versions, have interwoven them with their own commentaries, for the
        purpose of justifying the dogmas of their several
        schools.”</span><a href="#note_13" id="noteref_13" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>
        Moreover, <span class="tei tei-q">“according to a tradition preserved
        by the Buddhist schools, both of the South and of the North, the
        sacred Buddhist Canon comprised originally 80,000 or 84,000 tracts,
        but most of them were lost, so that there remained but
        6,000”</span>—as the Professor tells his audience. Lost, as usual—for
        Europeans. But who can be quite sure that they are likewise lost for
        Buddhists and Brâhmans?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considering the
        reverence of the Buddhists for every line written upon Buddha and the
        Good Law, the loss of nearly 76,000 tracts does <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg012"></a> seem miraculous. Had it been <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
        versâ</span></span>, every one acquainted with the natural course of
        events would subscribe to the statement that, of these 76,000, 5,000
        or 6,000 treatises <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might have been</span></em> destroyed during the
        persecutions in, and emigrations from, India. But as it is well
        ascertained that the Buddhist Arhats began their religious exodus,
        for the purpose of propagating the new faith beyond Kashmir and the
        Himâlayas, as early as the year 300 before our era,<a href="#note_14" id="noteref_14" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> and
        reached China in the year 61 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>,<a href="#note_15" id="noteref_15" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> when
        Kashyapa, at the invitation of the Emperor Ming-ti, went there to
        acquaint the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Heaven”</span> with the
        tenets of Buddhism, it does seem strange to hear the Orientalists
        speaking of such a loss as though it were really possible. They do
        not seem to allow for one moment the possibility that the texts may
        be lost only for the West and for themselves, or that the Asiatic
        people should have the unparalleled boldness to keep their most
        sacred records out of the reach of foreigners, thus refusing to
        deliver them to the profanation and misuse even of races so
        <span class="tei tei-q">“vastly superior”</span> to themselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judging by the
        expressed regrets and numerous confessions of almost every one of the
        Orientalists,<a href="#note_16" id="noteref_16" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a> the
        public may feel sufficiently sure, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that
        the students of ancient religions have indeed very few data upon
        which to build such final conclusions as they generally do about the
        old faiths, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) that such lack of data does not
        in the least prevent them from dogmatizing. One would imagine that,
        thanks to the numerous records of the Egyptian theogony and
        mysteries, preserved in the classics and in a number of ancient
        writers, the rites and dogmas of Pharaonic Egypt, at least, ought to
        be well understood; better, at any rate, than the too abstruse
        philosophies and Pantheism of India, of whose religion and language
        Europe had hardly any idea before the beginning of the present
        century. Along the Nile and on the face of the whole country, there
        stand to this hour, yearly and daily exhumed, ever fresh relics which
        eloquently tell their own history. Still it is not so. The learned
        Oxford Philologist himself confesses the truth by saying:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">We see still standing the pyramids, and the ruins of
        temples and labyrinths, their walls covered with hieroglyphic
        inscriptions, and with the strange pictures of gods and goddesses. On
        rolls of papyrus, which seem to defy the ravages of time,</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg013"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">we have even fragments of what may be called the
          sacred books of the Egyptians. Yet, though much has been deciphered
          in the ancient records of the mysterious race, the mainspring of
          the religion of Egypt and the original intention of its ceremonial
          worship are far from being fully disclosed to us.</span><a href="#note_17" id="noteref_17" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here again the
        mysterious hieroglyphic documents remain, but the keys by which alone
        they become intelligible have disappeared.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In fact so little
        acquainted are our greatest Egyptologists with the funerary rites of
        the Egyptians and the outward marks of the difference of sex on the
        mummies, that it has led to the most ludicrous mistakes. Only a year
        or two ago, one of this kind was discovered at Boulaq, Cairo. The
        mummy of what was considered the wife of an unimportant Pharaoh, has,
        thanks to an inscription found on an amulet hung round its neck,
        turned out to be that of Sesostris—the greatest King of Egypt!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
        having found that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is a natural
        connection between language and religion”</span>; and that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“there was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em>
        Âryan religion before the separation of the Âryan race; a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em>
        Semitic religion before the separation of the Semitic race; and a
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em> Turanic religion before the
        separation of the Chinese and the other tribes belonging to the
        Turanian class”</span>; having, in fact, discovered only <span class="tei tei-q">“three ancient centres of religion”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“three centres of language”</span>; and
        though as entirely ignorant of those primitive religions and
        languages as of their origin—the Professor does not hesitate to
        declare <span class="tei tei-q">“that a truly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical
        basis</span></em> for a scientific treatment of the principal
        religions of the world”</span> has been gained!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific treatment”</span> of a subject is no
        guarantee for its <span class="tei tei-q">“historical basis”</span>;
        and with such scarcity of data on hand, no Philologist, even among
        the most eminent, is justified in giving out his own conclusions for
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical
        facts</span></em>. No doubt, the eminent Orientalist has thoroughly
        proved to the world's satisfaction that, according to the phonetic
        rules of Grimm's law, Odin and Buddha are two different personages,
        quite distinct from each other, and has proved it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scientifically</span></em>. When, however, he
        takes the opportunity of saying in the same breath that Odin
        <span class="tei tei-q">“was worshipped as the supreme deity during a
        period long anterior to the age of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Veda</span></span> and
        of Homer,”</span><a href="#note_18" id="noteref_18" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> he has
        not the slightest <span class="tei tei-q">“historical basis”</span>
        for it, but makes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">history</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>
        subservient to his own conclusions, which may be very <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific”</span> in the sight of Oriental scholars,
        but yet very wide of the mark of actual <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg014"></a> truth. The conflicting views of the various
        eminent Philologists and Orientalists, from Martin Haug down to Prof.
        Max Müller himself, on the subject of chronology, in the case of the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, are an evident proof that
        the statement has no <span class="tei tei-q">“historical”</span>
        basis to stand upon, <span class="tei tei-q">“internal
        evidence”</span> being very often a Jack-o'-lantern, instead of a
        safe beacon to follow. Nor has the Science of modern Comparative
        Mythology any better argument to bring forward to crush the
        contention of those learned writers who have insisted for the last
        century or so that there must have been <span class="tei tei-q">“fragments of a primeval revelation, granted to the
        ancestors of the whole race of mankind ... preserved in the temples
        of Greece and Italy.”</span> For this is what all the Eastern
        Initiates and Pandits have been proclaiming to the world from time to
        time. And while a prominent Singhalese priest assured the writer that
        it was well known that the most important tracts, belonging to the
        Buddhist sacred canon, were stored away in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">countries and places
        inaccessible to the European Pandits</span></em>, the late Svâmi
        Dayanand Sarasvatî, the greatest Sanskritist of his day in India,
        assured some members of the Theosophical Society of the same fact
        with regard to ancient Brâhmanical works. When told that Professor
        Max Müller had declared to the audiences of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lectures</span></span>
        that the theory <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that there was a
        primeval preternatural revelation</span></em> granted to the fathers
        of the human race, finds but few supporters at present”</span>—the
        holy and learned man laughed. His answer was suggestive. <span class="tei tei-q">“If Mr. <span class="tei tei-q">‘Moksh Mooller’</span>
        [as he pronounced the name], were a Brâhman, and came with me, I
        might take him to a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gupa</span></span> cave [a secret crypt] near
        Okhee Math, in the Himâlayas, where he would soon find out that what
        crossed the Kâlapani [the black waters of the ocean] from India to
        Europe were only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bits of rejected copies of some passages from
        our sacred books</span></em>. There <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> a
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘primeval revelation,’</span> and it still
        exists; nor will it ever be lost to the world, but will reäppear;
        though the Mlechchhas will of course have to wait.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Questioned further
        on the point, he would say no more. This was at Meerut, in 1880.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No doubt the
        mystification played by the Brâhmans upon Colonel Wilford and Sir
        William Jones, in the last century, at Calcutta, was cruel, but it
        had been well deserved, and no one was more to blame in that affair
        than the missionaries and Colonel Wilford himself. The former, on the
        testimony of Sir William Jones himself,<a href="#note_19" id="noteref_19" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> were
        silly enough to maintain that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Hindûs
        were even now almost Christians, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg015"></a> because their Brahmâ, Vishnu and Mahesha were
        no other than the Christian trinity.”</span><a href="#note_20" id="noteref_20" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> It was a
        good lesson. It made the Oriental scholars doubly cautious; but
        perchance it has also made some of them too shy and, in its reäction,
        has caused the pendulum of foregone conclusions to swing too much the
        other way. For <span class="tei tei-q">“that first supply from the
        Brâhmanical market,”</span> in answer to the demand of Colonel
        Wilford, has now created an evident necessity and desire in the
        Orientalists to declare nearly every archaic Sanskrit manuscript so
        modern as to give the missionaries full justification for availing
        themselves of their opportunity. That they do so and to the full
        extent of their mental powers, is shown by the absurd attempts of
        late to prove that the whole Purânic story about Krishna was
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plagiarized
        by the Brâhmans from the Bible!</span></em> But the facts cited by
        the Oxford Professor in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lectures</span></span> concerning the now famous
        interpolations, for the benefit, and later on to the sorrow, of
        Colonel Wilford, do not at all interfere with the conclusions to
        which one who studies the Secret Doctrine must unavoidably come. For,
        if the results show that neither the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New</span></em> nor
        even the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span> borrowed anything
        from the more ancient religion of the Brâhmans and Buddhists, it does
        not follow that the Jews have not borrowed all they knew from the
        Chaldean records, the latter being mutilated later on by Eusebius. As
        to the Chaldeans, they assuredly got their primitive learning from
        the Brâhmans, for Rawlinson shows an undeniably Vedic influence in
        the early mythology of Babylon; and Colonel Vans Kennedy has long ago
        justly declared that Babylonia was, from her origin, the seat of
        Sanskrit and Brâhman learning. But all such proofs must lose their
        value, in the presence of the latest theory worked out by Prof. Max
        Müller. What it is everyone knows. The code of phonetic laws has now
        become a universal solvent for every identification and <span class="tei tei-q">“connection”</span> between the gods of many nations.
        Thus, though the Mother of Mercury (Budha, Thot-Hermes, etc.) was
        Maia, the mother of Gautama Buddha, also Mâyâ, and the mother of
        Jesus, likewise Mâyâ (Illusion, for Mary is Mare, the Sea, the great
        Illusion symbolically)—yet these three characters have no connection,
        nor can they have any, since Bopp has <span class="tei tei-q">“laid
        down his code of phonetic laws.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In their efforts
        to collect together the many skeins of unwritten <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg016"></a> history, it is a bold step for our
        Orientalists to take, to deny <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à
        priori</span></span> everything that does not dove-tail with their
        special conclusions. Thus, while new discoveries are daily made of
        great arts and sciences having existed far back in the night of time,
        yet even the knowledge of writing is refused to some of the most
        ancient nations, and they are credited with barbarism instead of
        culture. Nevertheless traces of an immense civilization, even in
        Central Asia, are still to be found. This civilization is undeniably
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prehistoric</span></em>. And how can there be
        civilization without a literature in some form, without annals or
        chronicles? Common sense alone ought to supplement the broken links
        in the history of departed nations. The gigantic and unbroken wall of
        the mountains that hem in the whole table-land of Tibet, from the
        upper course of the river Khuan-Khé down to the Karakorum hills,
        witnessed a civilization during millenniums of years, and should have
        strange secrets to tell mankind. The eastern and central portions of
        these regions—the Nan-chan and the Altyn-tag—were once upon a time
        covered with cities that could well vie with Babylon. A whole
        geological period has swept over the land, since those cities
        breathed their last, as the mounds of shifting sand and the sterile
        and now dead soil of the immense central plains of the basin of Tarim
        testify. The borderlands alone are superficially known to the
        traveller. Within those table-lands of sand there is water, and fresh
        oases are found blooming there, wherein no European foot has ever yet
        ventured, or trodden the now treacherous soil. Among these verdant
        oases there are some which are entirely inaccessible even to the
        profane native traveller. Hurricanes may <span class="tei tei-q">“tear up the sands and sweep whole plains away,”</span>
        they are powerless to destroy that which is beyond their reach. Built
        deep in the bowels of the earth, the subterranean stores are secure;
        and as their entrances are concealed, there is little fear that
        anyone would discover them, even should several armies invade the
        sandy wastes where—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is no
        need to send the reader across the desert, when the same proofs of
        ancient civilization are found even in comparatively populated
        regions of the same country. The oasis of Tchertchen, for instance,
        situated about 4,000 feet above the level of the river
        Tchertchen-Darya, is now surrounded in every direction by the ruins
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg017"></a> of archaic towns and cities.
        There, some 3,000 human beings represent the relics of about a
        hundred extinct nations and races, the very names of which are now
        unknown to our ethnologists. An anthropologist would feel more than
        embarrassed to class, divide and subdivide them; the more so, as the
        respective descendants of all these antediluvian races and tribes
        themselves know as little of their own forefathers as if they had
        fallen from the moon. When questioned about their origin, they reply
        that they know not whence their fathers had come, but had heard that
        their first, or earliest, men were ruled by the great Genii of these
        deserts. This may be put down to ignorance and superstition, yet in
        view of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine, the answer may be based
        upon primeval tradition. Alone the tribe of Khoorassan claims to have
        come from what is now known as Afghanistan, long before the days of
        Alexander, and brings legendary lore to that effect in corroboration.
        The Russian traveller Colonel (now General) Prjevalsky found quite
        close to the oasis of Tchertchen the ruins of two enormous cities,
        the oldest of which, according to local tradition, was destroyed
        3,000 years ago by a hero and giant, and the other by Mongolians in
        the tenth century of our era.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The emplacement of the two cities is now covered,
        owing to shifting sands and the desert wind, with strange and
        heterogeneous relics; with broken china and kitchen utensils and
        human bones. The natives often find copper and gold coins, melted
        silver ingots, diamonds, and turquoises, and what is the most
        remarkable—broken glass.... Coffins of some undecaying wood, or
        material, also, within which beautifully preserved embalmed bodies
        are found.... The male mummies are all extremely tall powerfully
        built men with long wavy hair.... A vault was found with twelve dead
        men sitting in it. Another time, in a separate coffin, a young girl
        was discovered by us. Her eyes were closed with golden discs, and the
        jaws held firm by a golden circlet running from under the chin across
        the top of the head. Clad in a narrow woollen garment, her bosom was
        covered with golden stars, the feet being left naked.</span><a href="#note_21" id="noteref_21" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this, the
        famous traveller adds that all along their way on the river
        Tchertchen they heard legends about twenty-three towns buried ages
        ago by the shifting sands of the deserts. The same tradition exists
        on the Lob-nor and in the oasis of Kerya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The traces of such
        civilization, and these and like traditions, give us the right to
        credit other legendary lore, warranted by well educated and learned
        natives of India and Mongolia who speak of immense libraries
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg018"></a> reclaimed from the sand,
        together with various relics of ancient Magic Lore, which have all
        been safely stowed away.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To recapitulate.
        The Secret Doctrine was the universally diffused religion of the
        ancient and prehistoric world. Proofs of its diffusion, authentic
        records of its history, a complete chain of documents, showing its
        character and presence in every land, together with the teaching of
        all its great Adepts, exist to this day in the secret crypts of
        libraries belonging to the Occult Fraternity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This statement is
        rendered more credible by a consideration of the following facts: the
        tradition of the thousands of ancient parchments saved when the
        Alexandrian library was destroyed; the thousands of Sanskrit works
        which disappeared in India in the reign of Akbar; the universal
        tradition in China and Japan that the true ancient texts with the
        commentaries, which alone make them comprehensible, amounting to many
        thousands of volumes, have long passed out of the reach of profane
        hands; the disappearance of the vast sacred and occult literature of
        Babylon; the loss of those keys which alone could solve the thousand
        riddles of the Egyptian hieroglyphic records; the tradition in India
        that the real secret commentaries which alone make the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>
        intelligible, though no longer visible to profane eyes, still remain
        for the Initiate, hidden in secret caves and crypts; and an identical
        belief among the Buddhists, with regard to their secret books.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Occultists
        assert that all these exist, safe from Western spoliating hands, to
        reäppear in some more enlightened age, for which, in the words of the
        late Svâmi Dayanand Sarasvatî, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Mlechchhas [outcasts, savages, those beyond the pale of Âryan
        civilization] will have to wait.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For it is not the
        fault of the Initiates that these documents are now <span class="tei tei-q">“lost”</span> to the profane; nor was their policy
        dictated by selfishness, or any desire to monopolise the life-giving
        sacred lore. There were portions of the Secret Science that for
        incalculable ages had to remain concealed from the profane gaze. But
        this was because the imparting to the unprepared multitude secrets of
        such tremendous importance was equivalent to giving a child a lighted
        candle in a powder magazine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer to a
        question which has frequently arisen in the minds of students, when
        meeting with statements such as this, may well be outlined here.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can understand,
        they say, the necessity for concealing from the herd such secrets as
        the Vril, or the rock-destroying force, discovered <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg 019]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg019"></a> by J. W. Keely, of Philadelphia, but we
        cannot understand how any danger could arise from the revelation of
        such a purely philosophical doctrine, for instance, as the evolution
        of the Planetary Chains.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The danger was
        that such doctrines as the Planetary Chain, or the seven Races, at
        once give a clue to the seven-fold nature of man, for each principle
        is correlated to a plane, a planet, and a race, and the human
        principles are, on every plane, correlated to seven-fold occult
        forces, those of the higher planes being of tremendous power. So that
        any septenary division at once gives a clue to tremendous occult
        powers, the abuse of which would cause incalculable evil to humanity;
        a clue which is, perhaps, no clue to the present
        generation—especially to Westerns, protected as they are by their
        very blindness and ignorant materialistic disbelief in the occult—but
        a clue which would, nevertheless, have been very real in the early
        centuries of the Christian era to people fully convinced of the
        reality of Occultism, and entering a cycle of degradation which made
        them rife for abuse of occult powers and sorcery of the worst
        description.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The documents were
        concealed, it is true, but the knowledge itself and its actual
        existence was never made a secret of by the Hierophants of the
        Temples, wherein the MYSTERIES have ever been made a discipline and
        stimulus to virtue. This is very old news, and was repeatedly made
        known by the great Adepts, from Pythagoras and Plato down to the
        Neo-Platonists. It was the new religion of the Nazarenes that wrought
        a change for the worse in the policy of centuries.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, there is
        a well-known fact—a very curious one, corroborated to the writer by a
        reverend gentleman attached for years to a Russian Embassy—that there
        are several documents in the St. Petersburg Imperial Libraries to
        show that, even so late as the days when Freemasonry and Secret
        Societies of Mystics flourished without hindrance in Russia, namely
        at the end of the last and the beginning of the present century, more
        than one Russian Mystic travelled to Tibet <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">viâ</span></span>
        the Ural Mountains in search of knowledge and initiation in the
        unknown crypts of Central Asia. And more than one returned years
        later, with a rich store of information such as could never have been
        given him anywhere in Europe. Several cases could be cited and
        well-known names brought forward, but for the fact that such
        publicity might annoy the surviving relatives of the late Initiates
        referred to. Let any one look over the annals and history of
        Freemasonry in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg
        020]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg020"></a>
        archives of the Russian metropolis, and he will assure himself of the
        fact above stated.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a
        corroboration of what has been stated many times before,
        unfortunately, too indiscreetly. Instead of benefiting humanity, the
        virulent charges of deliberate invention and imposture with a
        purpose, hurled at those who asserted a veritable, even if a little
        known fact, have only generated bad Karma for the slanderers. But now
        the mischief is done, and truth should no longer be denied, whatever
        the consequences.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is Theosophy a new
        religion, we are asked? By no means; it is not a <span class="tei tei-q">“religion,”</span> nor is its philosophy <span class="tei tei-q">“new”</span>; for, as already stated, it is as old as
        thinking man. Its tenets are not now published for the first time,
        but have been cautiously given out to, and taught by, more than one
        European Initiate—especially by the late Ragon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More than one
        great scholar has stated that there never was a religious founder,
        whether Âryan, Semitic or Turanian, who had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invented</span></em>
        a new religion, or revealed a new truth. These founders were all
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transmitters</span></em>, not original teachers.
        They were the authors of new forms and interpretations, while the
        truths upon which their teachings were based were as old as mankind.
        Thus out of the many truths revealed orally to man in the beginning,
        preserved and perpetuated in the Adyta of the temples through
        initiation, during the Mysteries and by personal transmission, they
        selected one or more of such grand verities—actualities visible only
        to the eye of the real Sage and Seer, and revealed them to the
        masses. Thus every nation received in its turn some of the said
        truths, under the veil of its own local and special symbolism, which,
        as time went on, developed into a more or less philosophical cultus,
        a Pantheon in mythical disguise. Therefore is Confucius, a very
        ancient legislator in historical chronology, though a very modern
        sage in the world's history, shown by Dr. Legge<a href="#note_22" id="noteref_22" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">22</span></span></a> to be
        emphatically a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transmitter</span></em>, not a maker. As he
        himself says, <span class="tei tei-q">“I only hand on: I cannot
        create new things. I believe in the ancients and therefore I love
        them.”</span><a href="#note_23" id="noteref_23" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer loves
        them too, and therefore believes in these ancients, and the modern
        heirs to their Wisdom. And believing in both, she now transmits that
        which she has received and learnt herself, to all those who will
        accept it. As to those who may reject her testimony—the great
        majority—she will bear them no malice, for they will be as right in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg021"></a> their way in denying, as she
        is right in hers in affirming, since they look at Truth from two
        entirely different stand-points. Agreeably with the rules of critical
        scholarship, the Orientalist has to reject <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à
        priori</span></span> whatever evidence he cannot fully verify for
        himself. And how can a Western scholar accept on hearsay that which
        he knows nothing about? Indeed, that which is given in these volumes
        is selected from oral, as much as from written teachings. This first
        instalment of the esoteric doctrines is based upon Stanzas, which are
        the records of a people unknown to ethnology. They are written, it is
        claimed, in a tongue absent from the nomenclature of languages and
        dialects with which philology is acquainted; are said to emanate from
        a source repudiated by Science—to-wit, Occultism; and finally they
        are offered through an agency, incessantly discredited before the
        world by all those who hate unwelcome truths, or have some special
        hobby of their own to defend. Therefore, the rejection of these
        teachings may be expected, and must be expected beforehand. No one
        styling himself a <span class="tei tei-q">“scholar,”</span> in
        whatever department of exact Science, will permit himself to regard
        these teachings seriously. They will be derided and rejected
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à
        priori</span></span> in this century, but only in this one. For in
        the twentieth century of our era scholars will begin to recognize
        that the Secret Doctrine has neither been invented nor exaggerated,
        but, on the contrary, simply outlined; and finally that its teachings
        antedate the Vedas. This is no pretension to prophecy, but simply a
        statement based on the knowledge of facts. Every century an attempt
        is being made to show the world that Occultism is no vain
        superstition. Once the door is permitted to remain a little ajar, it
        will be opened wider with every new century. The times are ripe for a
        more serious knowledge than hitherto permitted, though still, even
        now, very limited.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For have not even
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> been derided, rejected and
        called <span class="tei tei-q">“a modern forgery”</span> even so
        recently as fifty years ago? Was not Sanskrit proclaimed at one time
        the progeny of, and a dialect derived from, the Greek, according to
        Lemprière and other scholars? About 1820, as Prof. Max Müller tells
        us, the sacred books of the Brâhmans, of the Magians, and of the
        Buddhists, <span class="tei tei-q">“were all but unknown, their very
        existence was doubted, and there was not a single scholar who could

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same will be
        said of the Secret Archaic Doctrine, when undeniable proofs are given
        of its existence and records. But it will be centuries before much
        more is given from it. Speaking of the keys to the Zodiacal Mysteries
        as being almost lost to the world, it was remarked by the writer some
        ten years ago in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span> that: <span class="tei tei-q">“The said key must be turned seven times before the whole
        system is divulged. We will give it but one turn, and thereby allow
        the profane one glimpse into the mystery. Happy he, who understands
        the whole!”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same may be
        said of the whole Esoteric System. One turn of the key, and no more,
        was given in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>. Much more is
        explained in these volumes. In those days the writer hardly knew the
        language in which the work was written, and the disclosure of many
        things, freely spoken about now, was forbidden. In Century the
        Twentieth, some disciple more informed, and far better fitted, may be
        sent by the Masters of Wisdom to give final and irrefutable proofs
        that there exists a Science called Gupta Vidyâ; and that, like the
        once mysterious sources of the Nile, the source of all religions and
        philosophies now made known to the world has been for many ages
        forgotten and lost to men, but it is at last found.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a work as
        this has to be introduced with no simple preface, but with a volume
        rather—one that would give facts, not mere disquisitions, since
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The
        Secret Doctrine</span></span> is not a treatise, or a series of vague
        theories, but contains all that can be given out to the world in this
        century.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be worse
        than useless to publish in these pages even those portions of the
        esoteric teachings that have now escaped from confinement, unless the
        genuineness and authenticity, or at any rate the probability, of the
        existence of such teachings were first established. Such statements
        as will now be made, have to be shown as warranted by various
        authorities, such as ancient philosophers, classical writers and even
        certain learned Church Fathers, some of whom knew these doctrines
        because they had studied them, had seen and read works written upon
        them; and some of whom had even been personally initiated into the
        ancient Mysteries, during the performance of which the arcane
        doctrines were allegorically enacted. The writer will have to give
        historical and trustworthy names, and to cite well-known authors,
        ancient and modern, of recognized ability, good judgment, and
        truthfulness, as also to name some of the famous proficients in the
        secret arts and science, together with the mysteries of the latter,
        as they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg023"></a> are divulged, or
        rather partially presented before the public in their strange archaic
        form.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How is this to be
        done; what is the best way for achieving such an object, has been the
        ever-recurring question. To make our plan clearer, an illustration
        may be attempted. When a tourist, coming from a well-explored
        country, suddenly reaches the borderland of a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
        incognita</span></span>, hedged in, and shut out from view by a
        formidable barrier of impassable rocks, he may still refuse to
        acknowledge himself baffled in his exploratory plans. Ingress beyond
        is forbidden. But if he cannot visit the mysterious region
        personally, he may still find a means of examining it from as short a
        distance as can be arrived at. Helped by his knowledge of the
        landscapes left behind, he can get a general and pretty correct idea
        of the transmural view, if he will only climb to the loftiest summit
        of the altitudes in front of him. Once there, he can gaze at it at
        his leisure, comparing that which he dimly perceives with that which
        he has just left below, now that he is, thanks to his own efforts,
        beyond the line of the mists and the cloud-capped cliffs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a point of
        preliminary observation, cannot in these two volumes be offered to
        those who would like to get a more correct understanding of the
        mysteries of the pre-archaic periods given in the texts. But if the
        reader has patience, and will glance at the present state of beliefs
        and creeds in Europe, compare and check it with what is known to
        history of the ages directly preceding and following the Christian
        era, then he will find all this in a future volume of the present
        work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the latter
        volume a brief recapitulation will be made of all the principal
        Adepts known to history, and the downfall of the Mysteries will be
        described, after which began the disappearance and the systematic and
        final elimination from the memory of men of the real nature of
        Initiation and the Sacred Science. From that time its teachings
        became occult, and Magic sailed but too often under the venerable but
        frequently misleading name of Hermetic Philosophy. As real Occultism
        had been prevalent among the Mystics during the centuries that
        preceded our era, so Magic, or rather Sorcery, with its Occult Arts,
        followed the beginning of Christianity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However great and
        zealous the fanatical efforts, during these early centuries, to
        obliterate every trace of the mental and intellectual labour of the
        Pagans, they were a failure; but the same spirit of the dark demon of
        bigotry and intolerance has ever since systematically perverted every
        bright page written in the pre-Christian periods. Even <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg024"></a> history, in her uncertain records, has
        preserved enough of that which has survived to throw an impartial
        light upon the whole. Let, then, the reader tarry a little while with
        the writer on the spot of observation selected. He is asked to give
        all his attention to that millennium of the pre-Christian and the
        post-Christian periods, divided by the year One of the Nativity. This
        event—whether historically correct or not—has nevertheless been made
        to serve as a first signal for the erection of manifold bulwarks
        against any possible return of, or even a glimpse into, the hated
        religions of the Past; hated and dreaded, because throwing such a
        vivid light on the novel and intentionally veiled interpretation of
        what is now known as the <span class="tei tei-q">“New
        Dispensation.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However superhuman
        the efforts of the early Christian Fathers to obliterate the Secret
        Doctrine from the very memory of man, they all failed. Truth can
        never be killed; hence the failure to sweep away entirely from the
        face of the earth every vestige of that ancient Wisdom, and to
        shackle and gag every witness who testified to it. Let one only think
        of the thousands, perhaps millions, of MSS. burnt; of monuments, with
        their too indiscreet inscriptions and pictorial symbols, pulverized
        to dust; of the bands of early hermits and ascetics roaming about
        among the ruined cities of Upper and Lower Egypt, in desert and
        mountain, valley and highland, seeking for and eager to destroy every
        obelisk and pillar, scroll or parchment they could lay their hands
        on, if only it bore the symbol of the Tau, or any other sign borrowed
        and appropriated by the new faith—and he will then see plainly how it
        is that so little has remained of the records of the past. Verily,
        the fiendish spirit of fanaticism of early and mediæval Christianity
        and of Islam has loved from the first to dwell in darkness and
        ignorance; and both have made</p>

        fatally glowed. Over the portals of our own, the future seer may
        discern other words, that will point to the Karma for cunningly
        made-up history, for events purposely perverted, and for great
        characters slandered by posterity, mangled out of recognition,
        between the two cars of Jagannâtha—Bigotry and Materialism; one
        accepting too much, the other denying all. Wise is he who holds to

        by the Theosophical Society.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As already said in
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Preface</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Secret
        Doctrine</span></span> is not a version of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
        Unveiled</span></span>, as originally intended. It is rather a volume
        explanatory of the latter, and, though entirely independent of the
        earlier work, an indispensable corollary to it. Much of what was in
        the former work could hardly be understood by Theosophists in those
        days. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Secret Doctrine</span></span> will now
        throw light on many a problem left unsolved in the first work,
        especially on the opening pages, which have never been
        understood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As it was
        concerned simply with the philosophies within historical times and
        the respective symbolism of the fallen nations, only a hurried glance
        could be thrown at the panorama of Occultism in the two volumes of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis</span></span>. In the present work,
        detailed cosmogony and the evolution of the four Races that preceded
        our fifth-race Humanity are given, and now two large volumes explain
        that which was stated only on the first page of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
        Unveiled</span></span> alone, and in a few allusions scattered hither
        and thither throughout that work. Nor can the vast catalogue of the
        Archaic Sciences be attempted in the present volumes, before we have
        disposed of such tremendous problems as cosmic and planetary
        Evolution, and the gradual development of the mysterious humanities
        and races that preceded our Adamic Humanity. Therefore, the present
        attempt to elucidate some mysteries of the Esoteric Philosophy has,
        in truth, nothing to do with the earlier work. The writer must be
        allowed to illustrate what is said by an instance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volume I of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis</span></span> begins with a reference to an
        <span class="tei tei-q">“old book”</span>:</p>

        ponder over its pages an indefinite time, and still not quite agree
        as to the nature of the fabric upon which it is written. It is the
        only original copy now in existence. The most ancient Hebrew</span>

          from it, and that at a time when the former was already considered
          in the light of a literary relic. One of its illustrations
          represents the Divine Essence emanating from</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">Adam</span></span><a href="#note_25" id="noteref_25" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>

          earth, bringing a higher type of humanity in its vortex. As it
          approaches nearer and nearer to our planet, the Emanation becomes
          more and more shadowy, until upon touching the ground it is as
          black as night.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This very old book
        is the original work from which the many volumes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kiu-ti</span></span>

        the sacred volumes of the Egyptian Thoth-Hermes, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>
        in India, the Chaldean <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Numbers</span></span> and the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span> itself, are all derived
        from that one small parent volume. Tradition says, that it was taken
        down in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senzar</span></span>, the secret sacerdotal
        tongue, from the words of Divine Beings, who dictated it to the Sons
        of Light, in Central Asia, at the very beginning of our Fifth Race;
        for there was a time when its language (the Senzar) was known to the
        Initiates of every nation, when the forefathers of the Toltec
        understood it as easily as the inhabitants of the lost Atlantis, who
        inherited it, in their turn, from the sages of the Third Race, the
        Mânushis, who learnt it direct from the Devas of the Second and First
        Races. The illustration spoken of in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis</span></span>
        relates to the evolution of these Races and of our fourth- and
        fifth-race Humanity in the Vaivasvata Manvantara, or Round; each
        Round being composed of the Yugas of the seven periods of Humanity;
        four of which are now passed in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> Life-Cycle, the middle point of
        the fifth being nearly reached. This illustration is symbolical, as
        every one can well understand, and covers the ground from the
        beginning. The old book, having described cosmic evolution and
        explained the origin of everything on earth, including physical man,
        after giving the true history of the Races, from the First down to
        our own Fifth Race, goes no further. It stops short at the beginning
        of the Kali Yuga, just 4,989 years ago, at the death of Krishna, the
        bright Sun-god, the once living hero and reformer.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg027"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there exists
        another book. None of its possessors regard it as very ancient, as it
        was born with, and is only as old as the Black Age, namely, about
        5,000 years. In about nine years hence, the first cycle of the first
        five millenniums, that began with the great cycle of the Kali Yuga,
        will end. And then the last prophecy contained in that book—the first
        volume of the prophetic record for the Black Age—will be
        accomplished. We have not long to wait, and many of us will witness
        the dawn of the New Cycle, at the end of which not a few accounts
        will be settled and squared between the races. Volume II of the
        prophecies is nearly ready, having been in preparation since the time
        of Buddha's grand successor, Shankarâchârya.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One more important
        point must be noticed, one that stands foremost in the series of
        proofs given of the existence of one primeval, universal Wisdom—at
        any rate for Christian Kabalists and students. The teachings were, at
        least, partially known to several of the Fathers of the Church. It is
        maintained, on purely historical grounds, that Origen, Synesius, and
        even Clemens Alexandrinus, had themselves been initiated into the
        Mysteries before adding to the Neo-Platonism of the Alexandrian
        school that of the Gnostics, under the Christian veil. More than
        this, some of the doctrines of the secret schools, though by no means
        all, were preserved in the Vatican, and have since become part and
        parcel of the Mysteries, in the shape of disfigured additions made to
        the original Christian programme by the Latin Church. Such is the now
        materialised dogma of the Immaculate Conception. This accounts for
        the great persecutions set on foot by the Roman Catholic Church
        against Occultism, Masonry, and heterodox Mysticism generally.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The days of
        Constantine were the last turning-point in history, the period of the
        supreme struggle, that ended in the Western world throttling the old
        religions in favour of the new one, built on their bodies. From
        thence the vista into the far distant past, beyond the Deluge and the
        Garden of Eden, began to be forcibly and relentlessly shut out by
        every fair and unfair means from the indiscreet gaze of posterity.
        Every issue was blocked up, every record upon which hands could be
        laid, destroyed. Yet there remains enough, even among such mutilated
        records, to warrant us in saying that there is in them every
        requisite evidence of the actual existence of a Parent Doctrine.
        Fragments have survived geological and political cataclysms, to tell
        the story; and every survival shows evidence that the now secret
        Wisdom was once the one fountain head, the ever-flowing perennial
        source, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg028"></a> from which were fed
        all the streamlets—the later religions of all nations—from the first
        down to the last. This period, beginning with Buddha and Pythagoras
        at the one end and finishing with the Neo-Platonists and Gnostics at
        the other, is the only focus left in History wherein converge for the
        last time the bright rays of light streaming from the æons of times
        gone by, unobscured by the hand of bigotry and fanaticism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This accounts for
        the necessity under which the writer has laboured of ever explaining
        the facts given from the hoariest past by evidence gathered from the
        historical period, even at the risk of being once more charged with a
        lack of method and system. No other means was at hand. The public
        must be made acquainted with the efforts of many world-adepts, of
        initiated poets and writers in the classics of every age, to preserve
        in the records of humanity the knowledge at least of the existence of
        such a philosophy, if not actually of its tenets. The Initiates of
        1888 would indeed remain incomprehensible and even a seemingly
        impossible myth, were not like Initiates shown to have lived in every
        other age of history. This could be done only by naming chapter and
        verse where mention may be found of these great characters, who were
        preceded and followed by a long and interminable line of other famous
        antediluvian and postdiluvian Masters in the arts. Thus only could it
        be shown, on semi-traditional and semi-historical authority, that
        occult knowledge and the powers it confers on man, are not altogether
        fictions, but that they are as old as the world itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To my judges, past
        and future, therefore—whether they are serious literary critics, or
        those howling dervishes in literature who judge a book according to
        the popularity or unpopularity of the author's name, who, hardly
        glancing at its contents, fasten like lethal <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bacilli</span></span> on the weakest points of
        the body—I have nothing to say. Nor shall I condescend to notice
        those crack-brained slanderers—fortunately very few in number—who,
        hoping to attract public attention by throwing discredit on every
        writer whose name is better known than their own, foam and bark at
        their very shadows. These, having first maintained for years that the
        doctrines taught in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theosophist</span></span>, and which culminated
        in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
        Buddhism</span></span>, had been all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invented</span></em>
        by the present writer, have finally turned round, and denounced
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
        Unveiled</span></span> and the rest as a plagiarism from Éliphas Lévi
        (!), Paracelsus (!!), and, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mirabile dictu</span></span>, Buddhism and
        Brâhminism (!!!). As well charge Renan with having stolen his
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vie de
        Jésus</span></span> from the Gospels, and Max Müller his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg029"></a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sacred Books of the East</span></span> or his
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Chips</span></span> from the philosophies of the

        the readers of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Secret Doctrine</span></span> I may
        repeat what I have stated all along, and which I now clothe in the
        words of Montaigne:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pull the

        will never be able to make away with these. You can only ignore them,
        and no more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may close with
        a parting word concerning this first volume. In an introduction
        prefacing chapters dealing chiefly with cosmogony, certain subjects
        brought forward may be deemed out of place, but one more
        consideration added to those already given has led me to touch upon
        them. Every reader will inevitably judge the statements made from the
        stand-point of his own knowledge, experience, and consciousness,
        basing his judgment on what he has already learnt. This fact the
        writer is constantly obliged to bear in mind; hence, also the
        frequent references in this first volume to matters which, properly
        speaking, belong to a later part of the work, but which could not be
        passed by in silence, lest the reader should look upon it as a fairy
        tale indeed—a fiction of some modern brain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, the Past
        shall help to realize the Present, and the latter to better
        appreciate the Past. The errors of the day must be explained and
        swept away, yet it is more than probable—nay in the present case it
        amounts to certitude—that once more the testimony of long ages and of
        history will fail to impress any but the very intuitional—which is
        equal to saying the very few. But in this as in all like cases, the
        true and the faithful may console themselves by presenting the
        sceptical modern Sadducee with the mathematical proof and memorial of
        his obdurate obstinacy and bigotry. There still exists somewhere in
        the archives of the French Academy, the famous law of probabilities
        worked out by certain mathematicians for the benefit of sceptics by
        an algebraical process. It runs thus: If two persons give their
        evidence to a fact, and thus impart to it each of them 5/6 of
        certitude; that fact will have then 35/36 of certitude; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, its
        probability will bear to its improbability the ratio of 35 to 1. If
        three such evidences are joined together the certitude will become
        215/216. The agreement of ten persons giving each 1/2 of certitude
        will produce 1023/1024, etc., etc. The Occultist may remain satisfied
        with such certitude, and care for no more.</p>

<span style="font-size: 173%">Proem: Pages From A Pre-Historic
        Record.</span></h1>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An archaic
        Manuscript—a collection of palm leaves made impermeable to water,
        fire, and air, by some specific and unknown process—is before the
        writer's eye. On the first page is an immaculate white disk within a
        dull black ground. On the following page, the same disk, but with a
        central point. The first, the student knows, represents Kosmos in
        Eternity, before the reäwakening of still slumbering Energy, the
        Emanation of the World in later systems. The point in the hitherto
        immaculate disk, Space and Eternity in Pralaya, denotes the dawn of
        differentiation. It is the Point in the Mundane Egg, the Germ within
        it which will become the Universe, the All, the boundless, periodical
        Kosmos—a Germ which is latent and active, periodically and by turns.
        The one circle is divine Unity, from which all proceeds, whither all
        returns: its circumference—a forcibly limited symbol, in view of the
        limitation of the human mind—indicates the abstract, ever
        incognizable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Presence</span></span>, and its plane, the
        Universal Soul, although the two are one. Only, the face of the disk
        being white, and the surrounding ground black, clearly shows that its
        plane is the sole knowledge, dim and hazy though it still is, that is
        attainable by man. It is on this plane that the manvantaric
        manifestations begin; for it is in this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Soul</span></span>, that slumbers, during
        the Pralaya, the Divine Thought,<a href="#note_27" id="noteref_27" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">27</span></span></a> wherein
        lies concealed the plan of every future cosmogony and
        theogony.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg
        032]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg032"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One
        Life</span></span>, eternal, invisible, yet omnipresent, without
        beginning or end, yet periodical in its regular
        manifestations—between which periods reigns the dark mystery of
        Non-Being; unconscious, yet absolute Consciousness, unrealizable, yet
        the one self-existing Reality; truly, <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        Chaos to the sense, a Kosmos to the reason.”</span> Its one absolute
        attribute, which is Itself, eternal, ceaseless Motion, is called in
        esoteric parlance the Great Breath,<a href="#note_28" id="noteref_28" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a> which is
        the perpetual motion of the Universe, in the sense of limitless,
        ever-present Space. That which is motionless cannot be Divine. But
        then there is nothing in fact and reality absolutely motionless
        within the Universal Soul.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Almost five
        centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Leucippus, the
        instructor of Democritus, maintained that Space was eternally filled
        with atoms actuated by a ceaseless motion, which, in due course of
        time, as they aggregated, generated rotatory motion, through mutual
        collisions producing lateral movements. Epicurus and Lucretius taught
        the same doctrine, adding however to the lateral motion of the atoms
        the idea of affinity—an Occult teaching.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the beginning
        of man's inheritance, from the first appearance of the architects of
        the globe he lives on, the unrevealed Deity was recognized and
        considered under its only philosophical aspect—Universal Motion, the
        thrill of the creative Breath in Nature. Occultism sums up the One
        Existence thus: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Deity is an arcane,
        living [or moving] Fire, and the eternal witnesses to this unseen
        Presence, are Light, Heat, Moisture</span></span>,”</span>—this
        trinity including, and being the cause of, every phenomenon in
        Nature.<a href="#note_29" id="noteref_29" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
        Intra-cosmic motion is eternal and ceaseless; cosmic motion—the
        visible, or that which is subject to perception—is finite and
        periodical. As an eternal abstraction it is the Ever-Present;
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg033"></a> as a manifestation, it is
        finite both in the coming direction and the opposite, the two being
        the Alpha and Omega of successive reconstructions. Kosmos—the
        Noumenon—has nought to do with the causal relations of the phenomenal
        World. It is only with reference to the intra-cosmic Soul, the ideal
        Kosmos in the immutable Divine Thought, that we may say: <span class="tei tei-q">“It never had a beginning nor will it have an
        end.”</span> With regard to its body or cosmic organization, though
        it cannot be said that it had a first, or will ever have a last
        construction, yet at each new Manvantara, its organization may be
        regarded as the first and the last of its kind, as it evolves every
        time on a higher plane.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few years ago
        only, it was stated that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The esoteric doctrine, like Buddhism and Brâhmanism,
        and even Kabalism, teaches that the one infinite and unknown Essence
        exists from all eternity, and in regular and harmonious successions
        is either passive or active. In the poetical phraseology of Manu
        these conditions are called the Days and the Nights of Brahmâ. The
        latter is either</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">awake</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">or</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">asleep.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">The
        Svâbhâvikas, or philosophers of the oldest school of Buddhism, which
        still exists in Nepaul, speculate only upon the active condition of
        this</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Essence,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">which
        they call Svabhâvat, and deem it foolish to theorize upon the
        abstract and</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">unknowable</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">power
        in its passive condition. Hence they are called Atheists by both
        Christian theologians and modern scientists, for neither of the two
        are able to understand the profound logic of their philosophy. The
        former will allow of no other God than the personified secondary
        powers which have worked out the visible universe, and which becomes
        with them the anthropomorphic God of the Christians—the male Jehovah,
        roaring amid thunder and lightning. In its turn, rationalistic
        science greets the Buddhists and the Svâbhâvikas as the</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Positivists</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">of the
        archaic ages. If we take a one-sided view of the philosophy of the
        latter, our materialists may be right in their own way. The Buddhists
        maintain that there is no Creator, but an infinitude of creative
        powers, which collectively form the one eternal substance, the
        essence of which is inscrutable—hence not a subject for speculation
        for any true philosopher. Socrates invariably refused to argue upon
        the mystery of universal being, yet no one would ever have thought of
        charging him with atheism, except those who were bent upon his
        destruction. Upon inaugurating an active period, says the Secret
        Doctrine, an expansion of this Divine Essence from without inwardly
        and from within outwardly, occurs in obedience to eternal and
        immutable law, and the phenomenal or visible universe is the ultimate
        result of the long chain of cosmical forces thus progressively set in
        motion. In like manner, when the passive condition is resumed, a
        contraction of the Divine Essence takes place, and the previous work
        of creation is gradually and progressively undone. The visible
        universe becomes disintegrated, its material dispersed; and</span>

          causes it to disappear. This process has been going on from all
          eternity, and our present universe is but one of an infinite

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passage will
        be explained, as far as it is possible, in the present work. Though
        it contains nothing new to the Orientalist, as it now stands, its
        esoteric interpretation may contain a good deal which has hitherto
        remained entirely unknown to the Western student.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        illustration is a plain disk, [circle]. The second in the archaic
        symbol shows a disk with a point in it, [circle with dot]—the first
        differentiation in the periodical manifestations of the ever-eternal
        Nature, sexless and infinite, <span class="tei tei-q">“Aditi in
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span>,”</span><a href="#note_31" id="noteref_31" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> or
        potential Space within abstract Space. In its third stage the point
        is transformed into a diameter, [circle with line]. It now symbolizes
        a divine immaculate Mother-Nature within the all-embracing absolute
        Infinitude. When the horizontal diameter is crossed by a vertical
        one, [circle with cross], it becomes the Mundane Cross. Humanity has
        reached its Third Root-Race; it is the sign for the origin of human
        Life. When the circumference disappears and leaves only the [cross],
        it is a sign that the fall of man into matter is accomplished, and
        the Fourth Race begins. The cross within a circle symbolizes pure
        Pantheism; when the cross is left uninscribed, it becomes phallic. It
        had the same and yet other meanings as a Tau inscribed within a
        circle, [circle with lines (Tau)]; or as a Thor's Hammer—the
        so-called Jaina cross, or Svastika, within a circle, [circle with
        swastika].</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the third
        symbol—the circle divided in two by a horizontal diameter—was meant
        the first manifestation of creative Nature—still passive, because
        feminine. The first shadowy perception of man connected with
        procreation is feminine, because man knows his mother more than his
        father. Hence female deities were more sacred than male. Nature is
        therefore feminine, and, to a degree, objective and tangible, and the
        Spirit Principle which fructifies it, is concealed.<a href="#note_32" id="noteref_32" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> By
        adding to the horizontal line in the circle, a perpendicular, the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg035"></a> Tau was formed, [T], the
        oldest form of the letter. It was the glyph of the Third Root-Race to
        the day of its symbolical Fall—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, when the separation of sexes
        by natural evolution took place—when the figure became [circle with
        vertical line], or sexless life modified or separated—a double glyph
        or symbol. With the sub-races of our Fifth Race it became in
        symbology the Sacr', and in Hebrew N'cabvah, of the first-formed
        Races;<a href="#note_33" id="noteref_33" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> then it
        changed into the Egyptian emblem of life, [Ankh], and still later
        into the sign of Venus, [female symbol]. Then comes the Svastika
        (Thor's Hammer, now the Hermetic Cross), entirely separated from its
        circle, thus becoming purely phallic. The esoteric symbol of Kali
        Yuga is the five-pointed star reversed, with its two points (horns)
        turned heavenward, thus [five-pointed star], the sign of human
        sorcery, a position every Occultist will recognize as one of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“left-hand,”</span> and used in ceremonial
        magic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is hoped that
        during the perusal of this work the erroneous ideas of the public in
        general with regard to Pantheism will be modified. It is wrong and
        unjust to regard the Buddhists and Advaitin Occultists as Atheists.
        If not all of them philosophers, they are, at any rate, all
        logicians, their objections and arguments being based on strict
        reasoning. Indeed, if the Parabrahman of the Hindûs may be taken as a
        representative of the hidden and nameless deities of other nations,
        this absolute Principle will be found to be the prototype from which
        all the others were copied. Parabrahman is not <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span> because It is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em> God.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“It is that which is supreme, and not supreme
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">paravara</span></span>).”</span><a href="#note_34" id="noteref_34" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> It is
        supreme as cause, not supreme as effect. Parabrahman is simply, as a
        Secondless Reality, the all-inclusive Kosmos—or rather the infinite
        Cosmic Space—in the highest spiritual sense, of course. Brahman
        (neuter) being the unchanging, pure, free, undecaying supreme Root,
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“One true Existence,
        Paramârthika,”</span> and the absolute Chit and Chaitanya
        (Intelligence, Consciousness), cannot be a cognizer, <span class="tei tei-q">“for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span> can have no subject of
        cognition.”</span> Can the Flame be called the Essence of Fire? This
        Essence is <span class="tei tei-q">“the Life and Light of the
        Universe, the visible fire and flame are destruction, death, and
        evil.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire and Flame destroy the
        body of an Arhat, their essence makes him immortal.”</span><a href="#note_35" id="noteref_35" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The knowledge of the absolute Spirit, like
        the effulgence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg
        036]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg036"></a> of
        the sun, or like heat in fire, is naught else than the absolute
        Essence itself,”</span> says Shankarâchârya. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">It</span></span>—is <span class="tei tei-q">“the Spirit of the Fire,”</span> not Fire itself;
        therefore, <span class="tei tei-q">“the attributes of the latter,
        Heat or Flame, are not the attributes of the Spirit, but of that of
        which that Spirit is the unconscious cause.”</span> Is not the above
        sentence the true key-note of later Rosicrucian philosophy?
        Parabrahman is, in short, the collective aggregate of Kosmos in its
        infinity and eternity, the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span>”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">This</span></span>”</span> to which
        distributive aggregates can not be applied.<a href="#note_36" id="noteref_36" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“In the beginning <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">This</span></span> was the Self, one
        only;”</span><a href="#note_37" id="noteref_37" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> and the
        great Shankarâchârya explains that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">This</span></em>”</span> refers to the Universe
        (Jagat); the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
        beginning,”</span> meaning before the reproduction of the phenomenal
        Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, when
        the Pantheists echo the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>, which state, as in the
        Secret Doctrine, that <span class="tei tei-q">“This”</span> cannot
        create, they do not deny a Creator, or rather a collective aggregate
        of creators; they simply refuse, very logically, to attribute
        <span class="tei tei-q">“creation”</span> and especially
        formation—something finite—to an Infinite Principle. With them,
        Parabrahman is a passive because an absolute Cause, the unconditioned
        Mukta. It is only limited omniscience and omnipotence that are
        refused to the latter, because these are still attributes, reflected
        in man's perceptions; and because Parabrahman, being the Supreme
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>, the ever invisible
        Spirit and Soul of Nature, changeless and eternal, can have no
        attributes, the term Absoluteness very naturally precluding any idea
        of the finite or conditioned from being connected with it. And if the
        Vedântins postulate attributes as belonging simply to its emanation,
        calling it Îshvara <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em> Mâyâ, and Avidyâ (Agnosticism
        and Nescience rather than Ignorance), it is difficult to find any
        Atheism in this conception.<a href="#note_38" id="noteref_38" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> Since
        there can be neither two Infinites nor two Absolutes in a Universe
        supposed to be boundless, this Self-Existence can hardly be conceived
        of as creating personally. To the senses and in the perceptions of
        finite <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beings</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span> is Non-<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Being</span></span>, in

        lies concealed its coëternal and coëval emanation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg037"></a> or inherent radiation, which, becoming
        periodically Brahmâ (the male-female Potency), expands itself into
        the manifested Universe. <span class="tei tei-q">“Nârâyana moving on
        the [abstract] Waters of Space,”</span> is transformed into the
        Waters of concrete substance moved by him, who now becomes the
        manifested Word or Logos.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The orthodox
        Brâhmans, those who rise the most against the Pantheists and
        Advaitins, calling them Atheists, are forced, if Manu is any
        authority in this matter, to accept the death of Brahmâ, the Creator,
        at the expiration of every Age of this deity—100 Divine Years, a
        period which in our years requires fifteen figures to express. Yet no
        philosopher among them will view this <span class="tei tei-q">“death”</span> in any other sense than as a temporary
        disappearance from the manifested plane of existence, or as a
        periodical rest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Occultists
        are, therefore, at one with the Advaita Vedântin philosophers as to
        the above tenet. They show, on philosophical grounds, the
        impossibility of accepting the idea of the absolute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>
        creating or even evolving the Golden Egg, into which it is said to
        enter in order to transform itself into Brahmâ, the Creator, who
        later expands himself into the Gods and all the visible Universe.
        They say that absolute Unity cannot pass to Infinity, for Infinity
        presupposes the limitless extension of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something</span></em>, and the duration of that
        something; and the One All—like Space, which is its only mental and
        physical representation on this earth, or our plane of existence—is
        neither an object of, nor a subject to, perception. If one could
        suppose the eternal infinite All, the omnipresent Unity, instead of
        being in Eternity, becoming through periodical manifestation a
        manifold Universe or a multiple Personality, that Unity would cease
        to be one. Locke's idea, that <span class="tei tei-q">“pure space is
        capable of neither resistance nor motion,”</span> is incorrect. Space
        is neither a <span class="tei tei-q">“limitless void,”</span> nor a
        <span class="tei tei-q">“conditioned fulness,”</span> but both.
        Being—on the plane of absolute abstraction—the ever-incognizable
        Deity, which is void only to finite minds,<a href="#note_39" id="noteref_39" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a> and on
        that of mâyâvic perception, the Plenum, the absolute Container of all
        that is, whether manifested or unmanifested, it is, therefore, that
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Absolute All</span></span>. There is no
        difference between the Christian Apostle's <span class="tei tei-q">“in Him we live and move and have our being,”</span> and
        the Hindû Rishi's <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg

<span class="tei tei-q">“the Universe lives in, proceeds from, and
        will return to, Brahmâ”</span>: for Brahman (neuter), the
        unmanifested, is that Universe <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in

        symbolical orthodox dogmas, the God of the Apostle-Initiate and of
        the Rishi being both the Unseen and the Visible Space. Space is
        called, in esoteric symbolism, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven-Skinned Eternal Mother-Father.”</span> From its
        undifferentiated to its differentiated surface it is composed of

        Sons of God of the Jews, the Planetary Spirits of all nations, who
        have become Gods for men. The Occultist also regards the
        Âdi-Shakti—the direct emanation of Mûlaprakriti, the eternal Root of
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span>, and the female aspect
        of the Creative Cause, Brahmâ, in her âkâshic form of the Universal
        Soul—as philosophically a Mâyâ, and cause of human Mâyâ. But this
        view does not prevent him from believing in its existence so long as
        it lasts, to wit, for one Mahâmanvantara; nor from applying Âkâsha,
        the radiation of Mûlaprakriti,<a href="#note_42" id="noteref_42" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> to
        practical purposes, connected as this World-Soul is with all natural
        phenomena known or unknown to Science.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The oldest
        religions of the world—exoterically, for the esoteric root or
        foundation is one—are the Indian, the Mazdean, and the Egyptian. Next
        comes the Chaldean, the outcome of these, now entirely lost to the
        world, except in its disfigured Sabeanism as at present rendered by
        the archæologists. Then, passing over a number of religions that will
        be mentioned later, comes the Jewish, esoterically following in the
        line of Babylonian Magism, as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>;
        exoterically, a collection of allegorical legends, as in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>
        and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>. Read by the light of
        the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, the four initial chapters
        of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span> are the fragment of a
        highly philosophical page in the world's cosmogony. Left in their
        symbolical disguise, they are a nursery tale, an ugly thorn in the
        side of science and logic, an evident effect of Karma. To let them
        serve as a prologue to Christianity was a cruel revenge on the part
        of the Rabbis, who knew better what their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span> meant. It was a silent
        protest against their spoliation, and the Jews have now certainly the
        better of their traditional persecutors. The above-named exoteric
        creeds will be explained in the light of the universal doctrine as we
        proceed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Occult
        Catechism contains the following questions and answers:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">What is it that ever
        is?</span></span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Space, the eternal Anupâdaka

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Explain, O Lanoo

        circumference, for it is nowhere and everywhere; the One is the
        boundless Plane of the Circle, manifesting a Diameter only during the
        manvantaric periods; the One is the indivisible Point found nowhere,
        perceived everywhere during those periods; it is the Vertical and the
        Horizontal, the Father and the Mother, the summit and base of the
        Father, the two extremities of the Mother, reaching in reality
        nowhere, for the One is the Ring as also the Rings that are within

<span style="font-style: italic">It expands and contracts [exhalation
        and inhalation]. When it expands, the Mother diffuses and scatters;
        when it contracts, the Mother draws back and ingathers. This produces
        the periods of Evolution and Dissolution, Manvantara and Pralaya. The
        Germ is invisible and fiery; the Root [the Plane of the Circle] is
        cool; but during Evolution and Manvantara her garment is cold and
        radiant. Hot Breath is the Father who devours the progeny of the
        many-faced Element [heterogeneous], and leaves the single-faced ones
        [homogeneous]. Cool Breath is the Mother, who conceives, forms,
        brings forth, and receives them back into her bosom, to reform them
        at the Dawn [of the Day of Brahmâ, or Manvantara].</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For clearer
        understanding on the part of the general reader, it must be stated
        that Occult Science recognizes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em> Cosmic Elements—four entirely
        physical, and the fifth (Ether) semi-material, which will become
        visible in the Air towards the end of our Fourth Round, to reign
        supreme over the others during the whole of the Fifth. The remaining
        two are as yet absolutely beyond the range of human perception. They
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg041"></a> will, however, appear as
        presentments during the Sixth and Seventh Races of this Round, and
        will be fully known in the Sixth and Seventh Rounds
        respectively.<a href="#note_45" id="noteref_45" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> These
        seven Elements with their numberless sub-elements, which are far more
        numerous than those known to Science, are simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conditional</span></em> modifications and
        aspects of the One and only Element. This latter is not Ether,<a href="#note_46" id="noteref_46" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> not even

        now quite freely advocated by Science, is not the Ether hypothesized
        by Sir Isaac Newton—although he calls it by that name, having
        probably associated it in his mind with Æther, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Father-Mother”</span> of antiquity. As Newton
        intuitionally says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature is a perpetual
        circulatory worker, generating fluids out of solids, fixed things out
        of volatile, and volatile out of fixed, subtile out of gross, and

        Eternal, Boundless and Immutable <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Principle</span></span>,
        on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power
        of human conception and can only be dwarfed by any human expression
        or similitude. It is beyond the range and reach of thought—in the
        words of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mândûkya</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“unthinkable and unspeakable.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To render these
        ideas clearer to the general reader, let him set out with the
        postulate that there is One Absolute Reality which antecedes all
        manifested, conditioned Being. This Infinite and Eternal Cause—dimly
        formulated in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unconscious”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable”</span> of current European
        philosophy—is the Rootless Root of <span class="tei tei-q">“all that
        was, is, or ever shall be.”</span> It is of course devoid of all
        attributes and is essentially without any relation to manifested,
        finite Being. It is <span class="tei tei-q">“Be-ness”</span> rather
        than Being, Sat in Sanskrit, and is beyond all thought or
        speculation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Be-ness is
        symbolized in the Secret Doctrine under two aspects. On the one hand,
        absolute Abstract Space, representing bare subjectivity, the one
        thing which no human mind can either exclude from any conception, or
        conceive of by itself. On the other, absolute Abstract Motion
        representing Unconditioned Consciousness. Even our Western thinkers
        have shown that consciousness is inconceivable to us apart from
        change, and motion best symbolizes change, its essential
        characteristic. This latter aspect of the One Reality, is also
        symbolized by the term the Great Breath, a symbol sufficiently
        graphic to need no further elucidation. Thus, then, the first
        fundamental axiom of the Secret Doctrine is this metaphysical One
        Absolute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Be-ness</span></span>—symbolized by finite
        intelligence as the theological Trinity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may, however,
        assist the student if a few further explanations are here
        given.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
        043]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg043"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Herbert Spencer
        has of late so far modified his Agnosticism, as to assert that the
        nature of the <span class="tei tei-q">“First Cause,”</span><a href="#note_48" id="noteref_48" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> which
        the Occultist more logically derives from the Causeless Cause, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternal,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable,”</span> may be essentially the same as that
        of the consciousness which wells up within us: in short, that the
        impersonal Reality pervading the Kosmos is the pure noumenon of
        thought. This advance on his part brings him very near to the
        Esoteric and Vedântin tenet.<a href="#note_49" id="noteref_49" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parabrahman, the
        One Reality, the Absolute, is the field of Absolute Consciousness,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, that Essence which is out of
        all relation to conditioned existence, and of which conscious
        existence is a conditioned symbol. But once that we pass in thought
        from this (to us) Absolute Negation, duality supervenes in the
        contrast of Spirit (or Consciousness) and Matter, Subject and
        Object.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Spirit (or
        Consciousness) and Matter are, however, to be regarded, not as
        independent realities, but as the two symbols or aspects of the
        Absolute, Parabrahman, which constitute the basis of conditioned
        Being whether subjective or objective.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considering this
        metaphysical triad as the Root from which proceeds all manifestation,
        the Great Breath assumes the character of Pre-cosmic Ideation. It is
        the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">fons et origo</span></span> of Force and of all
        individual Consciousness, and supplies the guiding intelligence in
        the vast scheme of cosmic Evolution. On the other hand, Pre-cosmic
        Root-Substance (Mûlaprakriti) is that aspect of the Absolute which
        underlies all the objective planes of Nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as Pre-cosmic
        Ideation is the root of all individual Consciousness, so Pre-cosmic
        Substance is the substratum of Matter in the various grades of its
        differentiation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence it will be
        apparent that the contrast of these two aspects of the Absolute is
        essential to the existence of the Manifested Universe. Apart from
        Cosmic Substance, Cosmic Ideation could not manifest as individual
        Consciousness, since it is only through a vehicle (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">upâdhi</span></span>) of matter that
        consciousness wells up as <span class="tei tei-q">“I am I,”</span> a
        physical basis being necessary to focus a Ray of the Universal Mind
        at a certain stage of complexity. Again, apart from Cosmic Ideation,
        Cosmic Substance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg
        044]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg044"></a>
        would remain an empty abstraction, and no emergence of Consciousness
        could ensue.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Manifested
        Universe, therefore, is pervaded by duality, which is, as it were,
        the very essence of its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ex</span></em>-istence as Manifestation. But
        just as the opposite poles of Subject and Object, Spirit and Matter,
        are but aspects of the One Unity in which they are synthesized, so,
        in the Manifested Universe, there is <span class="tei tei-q">“that”</span> which links Spirit to Matter, Subject to
        Object.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This something, at
        present unknown to Western speculation, is called by Occultists
        Fohat. It is the <span class="tei tei-q">“bridge”</span> by which the
        Ideas existing in the Divine Thought are impressed on Cosmic
        Substance as the Laws of Nature. Fohat is thus the dynamic energy of
        Cosmic Ideation; or, regarded from the other side, it is the
        intelligent medium, the guiding power of all manifestation, the
        Thought Divine transmitted and made manifest through the Dhyân
        Chohans,<a href="#note_50" id="noteref_50" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> the
        Architects of the visible World. Thus from Spirit, or Cosmic
        Ideation, comes our Consciousness, from Cosmic Substance the several
        Vehicles in which that Consciousness is individualized and attains to
        self—or reflective—consciousness; while Fohat, in its various
        manifestations, is the mysterious link between Mind and Matter, the
        animating principle electrifying every atom into life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
        summary will afford a clearer idea to the reader.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Absoluteness</span></span>: the
        Parabrahman of the Vedântins or the One Reality, Sat, which is, as
        Hegel says, both Absolute Being and Non-Being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.) The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em> Logos: the impersonal, and, in
        philosophy, Unmanifested Logos, the precursor of the Manifested. This
        is the <span class="tei tei-q">“First Cause,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unconscious”</span> of European Pantheists.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3.) The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Second</span></em> Logos: Spirit-Matter, Life;
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of the Universe,”</span> Purusha
        and Prakriti.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4.) The
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Third</span></em> Logos: Cosmic Ideation, Mahat
        or Intelligence, the Universal World-Soul; the Cosmic Noumenon of
        Matter, the basis of the intelligent operations in and of Nature,
        also called Mahâ-Buddhi.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One
        Reality</span></span>: its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dual</span></em> aspects in the conditioned
        Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further, the
        Secret Doctrine affirms:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">II. The Eternity
        of the Universe <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in toto</span></span> as a boundless plane;
        periodically <span class="tei tei-q">“the playground of numberless

        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Manifesting Stars,”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg045"></a> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sparks of Eternity.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Eternity of the Pilgrim</span><a href="#note_51" id="noteref_51" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
<span style="font-style: italic">is like a wink of the Eye of
        Self-Existence</span></span>,”</span> as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
        Dyzan</span></span> puts it. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The appearance and
        disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux and
        reflux.</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This second
        assertion of the Secret Doctrine is the absolute universality of that
        law of periodicity, of flux and reflux, ebb and flow, which physical
        science has observed and recorded in all departments of nature. An
        alternation such as that of Day and Night, Life and Death, Sleeping
        and Waking, is a fact so common, so perfectly universal and without
        exception, that it is easy to comprehend that in it we see one of the
        absolutely fundamental Laws of the Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, the
        Secret Doctrine teaches:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">III. The
        fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Over-Soul, the
        latter being itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory
        pilgrimage for every Soul—a spark of the former—through the Cycle of
        Incarnation, or Necessity, in accordance with Cyclic and Karmic Law,
        during the whole term. In other words, no purely spiritual Buddhi
        (Divine Soul) can have an independent conscious existence before the
        spark which issued from the pure Essence of the Universal Sixth
        Principle—or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Over-Soul</span></span>—has (a) passed
        through every elemental form of the phenomenal world of that
        Manvantara, and (b) acquired individuality, first by natural impulse,
        and then by self-induced and self-devised efforts, checked by its
        Karma, thus ascending through all the degrees of intelligence, from
        the lowest to the highest Manas, from mineral and plant, up to the
        holiest Archangel (Dhyâni-Buddha). The pivotal doctrine of the
        Esoteric Philosophy admits no privileges or special gifts in man,
        save those won by his own Ego through personal effort and merit
        throughout a long series of metempsychoses and reïncarnations. This
        is why the Hindûs say that the Universe is Brahman and Brahmâ, for
        Brahman is in every atom of the universe, the six Principles in
        Nature being all the outcome—the variously differentiated aspects—of
        the Seventh and One, the only Reality in the Universe whether cosmic
        or micro-cosmic; and also why the permutations, psychic, spiritual
        and physical, on the plane of manifestation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg046"></a> and form, of the Sixth (Brahmâ the vehicle of
        Brahman) are viewed by metaphysical antiphrasis as illusive and
        mâyâvic. For although the root of every atom individually and of
        every form collectively, is that Seventh Principle or the One
        Reality, still, in its manifested phenomenal and temporary
        appearance, it is no better than an evanescent illusion of our
        senses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In its
        absoluteness, the One Principle under its two aspects, Parabrahman
        and Mûlaprakriti, is sexless, unconditioned and eternal. Its
        periodical manvantaric emanation, or primal radiation, is also One,
        androgynous and phenomenally finite. When the radiation radiates in
        its turn, all its radiations are also androgynous, to become male and
        female principles in their lower aspects. After Pralaya, whether the
        Great or Minor Pralaya—the latter leaving the worlds <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in statu
        quo</span></span><a href="#note_52" id="noteref_52" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>—the
        first that reäwakes to active life is the plastic Âkâsha,
        Father-Mother, the Spirit and Soul of Ether, or the Plane of the
        Circle. Space is called the Mother before its cosmic activity, and
        Father-Mother at the first stage of reäwakening. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
        it is also Father-Mother-Son. But whereas in the Eastern Doctrine,
        these are the Seventh Principle of the Manifested Universe, or its
        Atmâ-Buddhi-Manas (Spirit-Soul-Intelligence), the Triad branching off
        and dividing into seven cosmical and seven human Principles, in the
        Western <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> of the Christian Mystics
        it is the Triad or Trinity, and with their Occultists, the
        male-female Jehovah, Jah-Havah. In this lies the whole difference
        between the Esoteric and the Christian Trinities. The Mystics and the
        Philosophers, the Eastern and Western Pantheists, synthesize their
        pregenetic Triad in the pure divine abstraction. The orthodox,
        anthropomorphize it. Hiranyagarbha, Hari, and Shankara—the three
        Hypostases of the manifesting <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of the
        Supreme Spirit,”</span> by which title Prithivî, the Earth, greets
        Vishnu in his first Avatâra—are the purely metaphysical abstract
        qualities of Formation, Preservation, and Destruction, and are the
        three divine Avasthâs (Hypostases) of that which <span class="tei tei-q">“does not perish with created things,”</span> Achyuta, a
        name of Vishnu; whereas the orthodox Christian separates his Personal
        Creative Deity into the three Personages of the Trinity, and admits
        of no higher Deity. The latter, in Occultism, is the abstract
        Triangle; with the orthodox, the perfect Cube. The creative
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg047"></a> god or the aggregate gods are
        regarded by the Eastern philosopher as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhrântidarshanatah</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“false appearances,”</span> something <span class="tei tei-q">“conceived of, by reason of erroneous appearances, as a
        material form,”</span> and explained as arising from the illusive
        conception of the egotistic personal and human Soul (lower Fifth
        Principle). It is beautifully expressed in a revised translation in
        Fitzedward Hall's notes to Wilson's translation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu
        Purâna</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“That Brahma in its
        totality, has essentially the aspect of Prakriti, both evolved and
        unevolved [Mûlaprakriti], and also the aspect of Spirit and the
        aspect of Time. Spirit, O twice born, is the leading aspect of the
        Supreme Brahma.<a href="#note_53" id="noteref_53" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> The next
        is a two-fold aspect,—Prakriti, both evolved and unevolved, and Time
        is the last.”</span> Cronus is shown in the Orphic Theogony also as
        being a generated god or agent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this stage of
        the reäwakening of the Universe, the sacred symbolism represents it
        as a perfect Circle with the Point (Root) in the centre. This sign
        was universal, therefore we find it in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
        also. The Western <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, however, now in the hands
        of Christian Mystics, ignores it altogether, though it is plainly
        shown in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>. These sectarians begin at
        the end, and give, as the symbol of pregenetic Kosmos, [cross],
        calling it the <span class="tei tei-q">“Union of the Rose and
        Cross,”</span> the great mystery of occult generation, from whence
        the name—Rosicrucian (Rose Cross)! This may be seen from one of the
        most important and best known of their symbols, one which has never
        been hitherto understood even by modern Mystics. It is that of the
        Pelican tearing open its breast to feed its seven little ones—the
        real creed of the Brothers of the Rosie-Cross and a direct outcome
        from the Eastern Secret Doctrine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Brahman (neuter)
        is called Kâlahamsa, meaning, as explained by Western Orientalists,
        the Eternal Swan (or goose), and so is Brahmâ, the Creator. A great
        mistake is thus brought under notice; it is Brahman (neuter) which
        ought to be referred to as Hamsa-vâhana (that which uses the Swan as
        its Vehicle), and not Brahmâ, the Creator, who is the real Kâlahamsa;
        while Brahman (neuter) is Hamsa, and A-hamsa, as will be explained in
        the Commentaries. Let it be understood <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg048"></a> that the terms Brahmâ and Parabrahman are not
        used here because they belong to our Esoteric nomenclature, but
        simply because they are more familiar to the students in the West.
        Both are the perfect equivalents of our one, three, and seven
        vowelled terms, which stand for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One
        All</span></span>, and the One <span class="tei tei-q">“All in
        All.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such are the basic
        conceptions on which the Secret Doctrine rests.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would not be in
        place here to enter upon any defence or proof of their inherent
        reasonableness; nor can I pause to show how they are, in fact,
        contained—though too often under a misleading guise—in every system
        of thought or philosophy worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once that the
        reader has gained a clear comprehension of them and realized the
        light which they throw on every problem of life, they will need no
        further justification in his eyes, because their truth will be to him
        as evident as the sun in heaven. I pass on, therefore, to the subject
        matter of the Stanzas as given in this volume, adding a skeleton
        outline of them, in the hope of thereby rendering the task of the
        student more easy, by placing before him in a few words the general
        conception therein explained.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
        Cosmic Evolution, as traced in the Stanzas, is, so to say, the
        abstract algebraical formula of that evolution. Hence the student
        must not expect to find there an account of all the stages and
        transformations which intervene between the first beginnings of
        Universal Evolution and our present state. To give such an account
        would be as impossible as it would be incomprehensible to men who
        cannot grasp the nature of even the plane of existence next to that
        to which, for the moment, their consciousness is limited.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Stanzas,
        therefore, give an abstract formula which can be applied,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis mutandis</span></span>, to all
        evolution: to that of our tiny Earth, to that of the Chain of Planets
        of which that Earth forms one, to the Solar Universe to which that
        Chain belongs and so on, in an ascending scale, till the mind reels
        and is exhausted in the effort.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seven Stanzas
        given in this volume represent the seven terms of this abstract
        formula. They refer to, and describe, the seven great stages of the
        evolutionary process, which are spoken of in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>
        as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Creations,”</span> and in the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Days”</span> of Creation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza I</span></span>
        describes the state of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One All</span></span> during Pralaya,
        before the first flutter of reäwakening Manifestation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A moment's thought
        shows that such a state can only be symbolized; to describe it is
        impossible. Nor can it be symbolized except in negatives;
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg049"></a> for, since it is the state of
        Absoluteness <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, it can possess none of
        those specific attributes which serve us to describe objects in
        positive terms. Hence that state can only be suggested by the
        negatives of all those most abstract attributes which men feel rather
        than conceive, as the remotest limits attainable by their power of
        conception.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza II</span></span>
        describes a stage which, to a Western mind, is so nearly identical
        with that mentioned in Stanza I, that to express the idea of its
        difference would require a treatise in itself. Hence it must be left
        to the intuition and the higher faculties of the reader to grasp, as
        far as he can, the meaning of the allegorical phrases used. Indeed it
        must be remembered that all these Stanzas appeal to the inner
        faculties rather than to the ordinary comprehension of the physical
        brain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza
        III</span></span> describes the Reäwakening of the Universe to life
        after Pralaya. It depicts the emergence of the Monads from their
        state of absorption within the One, the earliest and highest stage in
        the formation of Worlds—the term Monad being one which may apply
        equally to the vastest Solar System or the tiniest atom.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza IV</span></span>
        shows the differentiation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Germ”</span> of the Universe into the Septenary
        Hierarchy of conscious Divine Powers, which are the active
        manifestations of the One Supreme Energy. They are the framers,
        shapers, and ultimately the creators of all the manifested Universe,
        in the only sense in which the name <span class="tei tei-q">“creator”</span> is intelligible; they inform and guide
        it; they are the intelligent Beings who adjust and control evolution,
        embodying in themselves those manifestations of the One Law, which we
        know as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Laws of Nature.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Generically, they
        are known as the Dhyân Chohans, though each of the various groups has
        its own designation in the Secret Doctrine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This stage of
        evolution is spoken of in Hindû mythology as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation of the Gods.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza V</span></span>
        describes the process of world-formation. First, diffused Cosmic
        Matter, then the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery Whirlwind,”</span>
        the first stage in the formation of a nebula. This nebula condenses,
        and after passing through various transformations, forms a Solar
        Universe, a Planetary Chain, or a single Planet, as the case may
        be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza VI</span></span>
        indicates the subsequent stages in the formation of a <span class="tei tei-q">“World”</span> and brings the evolution of such a World
        down to its fourth great period, corresponding to the period in which
        we are now living.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Stanza
        VII</span></span> continues the history, tracing the descent of life
        down to the appearance of Man; and thus closes the First Book of the
        Secret Doctrine.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
        050]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg050"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The development of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Man”</span> from his first appearance on
        this earth in this Round to the state in which we now find him will
        form the subject of Book II.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Stanzas which
        form the thesis of every section are given throughout in their modern
        translated version, as it would be worse than useless to make the
        subject still more difficult by introducing the archaic phraseology
        of the original, with its puzzling style and words. Extracts are
        given from the Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit translations of the
        original Senzar Commentaries and Glosses on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
        Dzyan</span></span>—now rendered for the first time into a European
        language. It is almost unnecessary to state that only portions of the
        seven Stanzas are here given. Were they published complete they would
        remain incomprehensible to all save a few high Occultists. Nor is
        there any need to assure the reader that no more than most of the
        profane, does the writer, or rather the humble recorder, understand
        those forbidden passages. To facilitate the reading, and to avoid the
        too frequent reference to foot-notes, it was thought best to blend
        together texts and glosses, using the Sanskrit and Tibetan proper
        names whenever these could not be avoided, in preference to giving
        the originals: the more so as the said terms are all accepted
        synonyms, the latter only being used between a Master and his Chelâs
        (or Disciples).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, were one to
        translate into English, using only the substantives and technical
        terms as employed in one of the Tibetan and Senzar versions, shloka 1
        would read as follows:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tho-ag in Zhi-gyu slept
        seven Khorlo. Zodmanas zhiba. All Nyug bosom. Konch-hog not;
        Thyan-Kam not; Lha-Chohan not; Tenbrel Chugnyi not; Dharmakâya
        ceased; Tgenchang not become; Barnang and Ssa in Ngovonyidj; alone
        Tho-og Yinsin in night of Sun-chan and Yong-Grub [Paranishpanna],
        etc., etc.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This would sound
        like pure <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abracadabra</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As this work is
        written for the instruction of students of Occultism, and not for the
        benefit of Philologists, we may well avoid such foreign terms
        wherever it is possible to do so. The untranslateable terms alone,
        incomprehensible unless their meanings are explained, are left, but
        all such terms are rendered in their Sanskrit form. Needless to
        remind the reader that these are, in almost every case, the late
        developments of the latter language, and pertain to the Fifth
        Root-Race. Sanskrit, as now known, was not spoken by the Atlanteans,
        and most of the philosophical terms used in the systems of the India
        of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg051"></a> Post-Mahâbhâratan
        period are not found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, nor are they to be met with
        in the original Stanzas, but only their equivalents. The reader who
        is not a Theosophist, is once more invited to regard all that follows
        as a fairy tale, if he likes; at best as one of the yet unproven
        speculations of dreamers; and, at the worst, as an additional
        hypothesis to the many scientific hypotheses past, present and
        future, some exploded, others still lingering. It is not in any sense
        less scientific than are many of the so-called scientific theories;
        and it is in every case more philosophical and probable.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of the
        abundant comments and explanations required, the references to the
        footnotes are marked in the usual way, while the sentences to be
        commented upon are marked with letters. Additional matter will be
        found in the Chapters on Symbolism, which are often more full of
        information than the Commentaries.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. ... The
            last Vibration of the Seventh Eternity thrills through
            Infinitude. The Mother swells, expanding from within without,
            like the Bud of the Lotus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The
            Vibration sweeps along, touching with its swift Wing the whole
            Universe and the Germ that dwelleth in Darkness, the Darkness
            that breathes over the slumbering Waters of Life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. Darkness
            radiates Light, and Light drops one solitary Ray into the Waters,
            into the Mother-Deep. The Ray shoots <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg058"></a> through the Virgin Egg, the Ray causes the
            Eternal Egg to thrill, and drop the non-eternal Germ, which
            condenses into the World-Egg.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. The Three
            fall into the Four. The Radiant Essence becomes Seven inside,
            Seven outside. The Luminous Egg, which in itself is Three,
            curdles and spreads in milk-white Curds throughout the Depths of
            Mother, the Root that grows in the Depths of the Ocean of
            Life.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. The Root
            remains, the Light remains, the Curds remain, and still Oeaohoo
            is One.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. The Root of
            Life was in every Drop of the Ocean of Immortality, and the Ocean
            was Radiant Light, which was Fire, and Heat, and Motion. Darkness
            vanished and was no more; it disappeared in its own Essence, the
            Body of Fire and Water, of Father and Mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. Behold, O
            Lanoo, the Radiant Child of the Two, the unparalleled refulgent
            Glory—Bright Space, Son of Dark Space, who emerges from the
            Depths of the great Dark Waters. It is Oeaohoo, the Younger, the
            ——. He shines forth as the Sun, he is the Blazing Divine Dragon
            of Wisdom; the Eka is Chatur, and Chatur takes to itself Tri, and
            the Union produces the Sapta, in whom are the Seven, which become
            the Tridasha, the Hosts and the Multitudes. Behold him lifting
            the Veil, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
            059]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg059"></a>
            unfurling it from East to West. He shuts out the Above, and
            leaves the Below to be seen as the Great Illusion. He marks the
            places for the Shining Ones, and turns the Upper into a shoreless
            Sea of Fire, and the One Manifested into the Great Waters.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8. Where was
            the Germ, and where was now Darkness? Where is the Spirit of the
            Flame that burns in thy Lamp, O Lanoo? The Germ is That, and That
            is Light, the White Brilliant Son of the Dark Hidden Father.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">9. Light is
            Cold Flame, and Flame is Fire, and Fire produces Heat, which
            yields Water—the Water of Life in the Great Mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">10.
            Father-Mother spin a Web, whose upper end is fastened to Spirit,
            the Light of the One Darkness, and the lower one to its shadowy
            end, Matter; and this Web is the Universe, spun out of the Two
            Substances made in One, which is Svabhâvat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">11. It expands
            when the Breath of Fire is upon it; it contracts when the Breath
            of the Mother touches it. Then the Sons dissociate and scatter,
            to return into their Mother's Bosom, at the end of the Great Day,
            and re-become one with her. When it is cooling, it becomes
            radiant. Its Sons expand and contract through their own Selves
            and Hearts; they embrace Infinitude.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg060"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">12. Then
            Svabhâvat sends Fohat to harden the Atoms. Each is a part of the
            Web. Reflecting the <span class="tei tei-q">“Self-Existent

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. This was

            Fohat is the Steed, and the Thought is the Rider. He passes like

            Seven Strides through the Seven Regions above, and the Seven

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. He is their

            in their radiant dwellings, and forms therewith the Germs of
            Wheels. He places them in the Six Directions of Space, and One in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Parent,”</span> Space, is the eternal,
            ever-present Cause of all—the incomprehensible <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Deity</span></span>, whose
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Invisible Robes”</span> are the mystic
            Root of all Matter, and of the Universe. Space is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one eternal
            thing</span></em> that we can most easily imagine, immovable in
            its abstraction and uninfluenced by either the presence or
            absence in it of an objective Universe. It is without dimension,
            in every sense, and self-existent. Spirit is the first
            differentiation from <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span>,”</span> the
            Causeless Cause of both Spirit and Matter. As taught in the
            Esoteric Catechism, it is neither <span class="tei tei-q">“limitless void,”</span> nor <span class="tei tei-q">“conditioned fulness,”</span> but both. It was and
            ever will be.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Robes”</span> stand for the noumenon of
            undifferentiated Cosmic Matter. It is not matter as we know it,
            but the spiritual essence of matter, and is coëternal and even
            one with Space in its abstract sense. Root-Nature is also the
            source of the subtile invisible properties in visible matter. It
            is the Soul, so to say, of the One Infinite Spirit. The Hindûs
            call it Mûlaprakriti, and say that it is the primordial
            Substance, which is the basis of the Upâdhi or Vehicle of every
            phenomenon, whether physical, psychic or mental. It is the source
            from which Âkâsha radiates.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Eternities,”</span> æons or
            periods are meant. The word Eternity, as understood in Christian
            theology, has no meaning to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg068"></a> Asiatic ear, except in its application to
            the One Existence; nor is the term <span class="tei tei-q">“sempiternity,”</span> the eternal only in futurity,
            anything better than a misnomer.<a href="#note_55" id="noteref_55" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> Such
            words do not and cannot exist in philosophical metaphysics, and
            were unknown till the advent of ecclesiastical Christianity. The
            Seven Eternities mean the seven periods, or a period answering in
            its duration to the seven periods, of a Manvantara, extending
            throughout a Mahâkalpa or <span class="tei tei-q">“Great
            Age”</span> (100 Years of Brahmâ), making a total of
            311,040,000,000,000 of years; each Year of Brahmâ being composed
            of 360 Days, and of the same number of Nights of Brahmâ
            (reckoning by the Chandrâyana or lunar year); and a Day of Brahmâ
            consisting of 4,320,000,000 of mortal years. These Eternities
            belong to the most secret calculations, in which, in order to
            arrive at the true total, every figure must be 7x, x varying
            according to the nature of the cycle in the subjective or real
            world; and every figure relating to, or representing, the
            different cycles—from the greatest to the smallest—in the
            objective or unreal world, must necessarily be multiples of
            seven. The key to this cannot be given, for herein lies the
            mystery of esoteric calculations, and for the purposes of
            ordinary calculation it has no sense. <span class="tei tei-q">“The number seven,”</span> says the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the great number of the Divine Mysteries”</span>;
            number ten is that of all human knowledge (the Pythagorean
            Decad); 1,000 is the number ten to the third power, and therefore
            the number 7,000 is also symbolical. In the Secret Doctrine the
            figure 4 is the male symbol only on the highest plane of
            abstraction; on the plane of matter the 3 is the masculine and
            the 4 the feminine—the upright and the horizontal in the fourth
            stage of symbolism, when the symbols become the glyphs of the
            generative powers on the physical plane.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Time”</span> is only an illusion produced by the
            succession of our states of consciousness as we travel through
            Eternal Duration, and it does not exist where no consciousness
            exists in which the illusion can be produced, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg069"></a> but <span class="tei tei-q">“lies asleep.”</span> The Present is only a
            mathematical line which divides that part of Eternal Duration
            which we call the Future, from that part which we call the Past.
            Nothing on earth has real duration, for nothing remains without
            change—or the same—for the billionth part of a second; and the
            sensation we have of the actuality of the division of Time known
            as the Present, comes from the blurring of the momentary glimpse,
            or succession of glimpses, of things that our senses give us, as
            those things pass from the region of ideals, which we call the
            Future, to the region of memories that we name the Past. In the
            same way we experience a sensation of duration in the case of the
            instantaneous electric spark, by reason of the blurred and
            continuing impression on the retina. The real person or thing
            does not consist solely of what is seen at any particular moment,
            but is composed of the sum of all its various and changing
            conditions from its appearance in material form to its
            disappearance from earth. It is these <span class="tei tei-q">“sum-totals”</span> that exist from eternity in the
            Future, and pass by degrees through matter, to exist for eternity
            in the Past. No one would say that a bar of metal dropped into
            the sea came into existence as it left the air, and ceased to
            exist as it entered the water, and that the bar itself consisted
            only of that cross-section thereof which at any given moment
            coincided with the mathematical plane that separates, and, at the
            same time, joins, the atmosphere and the ocean. Even so of
            persons and things, which, dropping out of the <span class="tei tei-q">“to be”</span> into the <span class="tei tei-q">“has
            been,”</span> out of the Future into the Past—present momentarily
            to our senses a cross-section, as it were, of their total selves,
            as they pass through Time and Space (as Matter) on their way from
            one eternity to another: and these two eternities constitute that
            Duration in which alone anything has true existence, were our
            senses but able to cognize it.</p>

            plane of existence only by manifesting on that plane through an
            appropriate basis or vehicle; and during the long Night of rest
            called Pralaya, when all the Existences are dissolved, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Universal Mind”</span> remains as a
            permanent possibility of mental action, or as that abstract
            absolute Thought, of which Mind is the concrete relative
            manifestation. The Ah-hi (Dhyân Chohans) are the collective hosts
            of spiritual Beings—the Angelic Hosts of Christianity, the Elohim
            and <span class="tei tei-q">“Messengers”</span> of the Jews—who
            are the Vehicle for the manifestation of the Divine or Universal

            of a nation manifests itself, and which is composed of
            army-corps, divisions, brigades, regiments, and so forth, each
            with its separate individuality or life, and its limited freedom
            of action and limited responsibilities; each contained in a
            larger individuality, to which its own interests are subservient,
            and each containing lesser individualities in itself.</p>

            theory of the stream of catenated law which produces merit and
            demerit, and finally brings Karma into full sway. It is a system
            based upon the great truth that reïncarnation is to be dreaded,
            as existence in this world entails upon man only suffering,
            misery and pain; death itself being unable to deliver man from
            it, since death is merely the door through which he passes to
            another life on earth after a little rest on its
            threshold—Devachan. The Hînayâna System, or School of the Little
            Vehicle, is of very ancient growth; while the Mahâyâna, or School
            of the Great Vehicle, is of a later period, having originated
            after the death of Buddha. Yet the tenets of the latter are as
            old as the hills that have contained such schools from time
            immemorial, and the Hînayâna and Mahâyâna Schools both teach the
            same doctrine in reality. Yâna, or Vehicle, is a mystic
            expression, both <span class="tei tei-q">“Vehicles”</span>
            inculcating that man may escape the sufferings of rebirth and
            even the false bliss of Devachan, by obtaining Wisdom and
            Knowledge, which alone can dispel the Fruits of Illusion and
            Ignorance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mâyâ, or
            Illusion, is an element which enters into all finite things, for
            everything that exists has only a relative, not an absolute,
            reality, since the appearance which the hidden noumenon assumes
            for any observer depends upon his power of cognition. To the
            untrained eye of the savage, a painting is at first an unmeaning
            confusion of streaks and daubs of colour, while an educated eye
            sees instantly a face or a landscape. Nothing is permanent except
            the one hidden absolute Existence which contains in itself the
            noumena of all realities. The Existences belonging to every plane
            of being, up to the highest Dhyân Chohans, are, comparatively,
            like the shadows cast by a magic lantern on a colourless screen.
            Nevertheless all things are relatively real, for the cognizer is
            also a reflection, and the things cognized are therefore as real
            to him as himself. Whatever reality things possess, must be
            looked for in them before or after they have passed like a flash
            through the material world; for we cannot cognize any such
            existence directly, so long as we have sense-instruments which
            bring only material existence into the field of our
            consciousness. Whatever plane our consciousness may be acting in,
            both we and the things belonging to that plane are, for the time
            being, our only realities. But as we rise in the scale of
            development, we perceive that in the stages through which we have
            passed, we mistook shadows for realities, and that the upward
            progress of the Ego is a series of progressive awakenings, each
            advance bringing with it the idea that now, at last, we have
            reached <span class="tei tei-q">“reality”</span>; but only
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg072"></a> when we shall have
            reached absolute Consciousness, and blended our own with it,
            shall we be free from the delusions produced by Mâyâ.</p>

            inconceivable except as coming from some source which is the
            cause of it: and as, in the case of Primordial Light, that source
            is unknown, though so strongly demanded by reason and logic,
            therefore it is called <span class="tei tei-q">“Darkness”</span>
            by us, from an intellectual point of view. As to borrowed or
            secondary light, whatever its source, it can be only of a
            temporary mâyâvic character. Darkness, then, is the Eternal
            Matrix in which the Sources of Light appear and disappear.
            Nothing is added to darkness to make of it light, or to light to
            make it darkness, on this our plane. They are interchangeable;
            and, scientifically, light is but a mode of darkness and
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>. Yet both are
            phenomena of the same noumenon—which is absolute darkness to the
            scientific mind, and but a gray twilight to the perception of the
            average Mystic, though to that of the spiritual eye of the
            Initiate it is absolute light. How far we discern the light that
            shines in darkness depends upon our powers of vision. What is
            light to us is darkness to certain insects, and the eye of the
            clairvoyant sees illumination where the normal eye perceives only
            blackness. When the whole Universe was plunged in sleep—had
            returned to its one primordial element—there was neither centre
            of luminosity, nor eye to perceive light, and darkness

            Manvataric Dawn, which is the commencement of a new Day or new
            activity of Brahmâ—the symbol of a Universe. In esoteric
            parlance, Brahmâ is Father-Mother-Son, or Spirit, Soul and Body
            at once; each personage being symbolical of an attribute, and
            each attribute or quality being a graduated efflux of Divine
            Breath in its cyclic differentiation, involutionary and
            evolutionary. In the cosmico-physical sense, it is the Universe,
            the Planetary Chain and the Earth; in the purely spiritual, the
            Unknown Deity, Planetary Spirit, and Man—the son of the two, the
            creature of Spirit and Matter, and a manifestation of them in his
            periodical appearances on Earth during the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wheels,”</span> or the Manvantaras.</p>

            Seven Creative Spirits, the Dhyân Chohans, who correspond to the
            Hebrew Elohim. It is the same Hierarchy of Archangels to which
            St. Michael, St. Gabriel, and others belong, in Christian
            Theogony. Only while St. Michael, for instance, is allowed in
            dogmatic Latin Theology to watch over all the promontories and
            gulfs, in the Esoteric System the Dhyânis watch successively over
            one of the Rounds and the great Root-Races of our Planetary
            Chain. They are, moreover, said to send their Bodhisattvas, the
            human correspondents of the Dhyâni-Buddhas during every Round and
            Race. Out of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Truths”</span>
            and Revelations, or rather revealed secrets, four only have been
            handed to us, as we are still in the Fourth Round, and the world
            also has had only four Buddhas, so far. This is a very
            complicated question, and will receive more ample treatment later
            on.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far

            Four Gospels. But as every new Root-Race at the head of a Round
            must have its revelation and revealers, the next Round will bring
            the Fifth, the following the Sixth, and so on.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Paranishpanna”</span> is the Absolute
            Perfection to which all Existences attain at the close of a great
            period of activity, or Mahâmanvantara, and in which they rest
            during the succeeding period of repose. In Tibetan it is called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Yong-Grub.”</span> Up to the day of the
            Yogâchârya School the true nature of Paranirvâna was taught
            publicly, but since then it has become entirely esoteric; hence
            so many contradictory interpretations of it. It is only a true
            Idealist who can understand it. Everything has to be viewed as
            ideal, with the exception of Paranirvâna, by him who would
            comprehend that state, and acquire a knowledge of how Non-Ego,
            Voidness, and Darkness are Three in One, and alone self-existent
            and perfect. It is absolute, however, only in a relative sense,
            for it must give room to still further absolute perfection,
            according to a higher standard of excellence in the following
            period of activity—just as a perfect flower must cease to be a
            perfect flower and die, in order to grow into a perfect fruit, if
            such a mode of expression may be permitted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Secret
            Doctrine teaches the progressive development of everything,
            worlds as well as atoms; and this stupendous development has
            neither conceivable beginning nor imaginable end. Our
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Universe”</span> is only one of an
            infinite number of Universes, all of them <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Necessity,”</span> because links in the
            great cosmic chain of Universes, each one standing in the
            relation of an effect as regards its predecessor, and of a cause
            as regards its successor.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The appearance
            and disappearance of the Universe are pictured as an outbreathing
            and inbreathing of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great

            of the three symbols of the Absolute—Abstract Space and Duration
            being the other two. When the Great Breath is projected, it is
            called the Divine Breath, and is regarded as the breathing of the
            Unknowable Deity—the One Existence—which breathes out a thought,
            as it were, which becomes the Kosmos. So also is it that when the
            Divine Breath is inspired, the Universe disappears into the bosom
            of the Great Mother, who then sleeps <span class="tei tei-q">“wrapped in her Ever-Invisible Robes.”</span></p>

            Absolute Existence, but cannot picture <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg075"></a> to our imagination as any form of Existence
            that we can distinguish from Non-Existence. The three periods—the
            Present, the Past and the Future—are in Esoteric Philosophy a
            compound time; for the three are a composite number only in
            relation to the phenomenal plane, but in the realm of noumena
            have no abstract validity. As said in the Scriptures:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Past Time is the Present Time, as
            also the Future, which, though it has not come into existence,
            still is,”</span> according to a precept in the Prasanga
            Madhyamika teaching, whose dogmas have been known ever since it
            broke away from the purely esoteric schools.<a href="#note_63" id="noteref_63" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> Our
            ideas, in short, on duration and time are all derived from our
            sensations according to the laws of association. Inextricably
            bound up with the relativity of human knowledge, they
            nevertheless can have no existence except in the experience of
            the individual Ego, and perish when its evolutionary march
            dispels the Mâyâ of phenomenal existence. What is time, for
            instance, but the panoramic succession of our states of
            consciousness? In the words of a Master, <span class="tei tei-q">“I feel irritated at having to use these three clumsy
            words—Past, Present, and Future—miserable concepts of the
            objective phases of the subjective whole, they are about as
            ill-adapted for the purpose as an axe for fine carving.”</span>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Causes of Existence”</span> mean not
            only the physical causes known to Science, but the metaphysical
            causes, the chief of which is the desire to exist, an outcome of
            Nidâna and Mâyâ. This desire for a sentient life shows itself in
            everything, from an atom to a sun, and is a reflection of the
            Divine Thought propelled into objective existence, into a law
            that the Universe should exist. According to Esoteric teaching,
            the real cause of that supposed desire, and of all existence,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg076"></a> remains for ever
            hidden, and its first emanations are the most complete
            abstractions mind can conceive. These abstractions must of
            necessity be postulated as the cause of the material Universe
            which presents itself to the senses and intellect, and must
            underlie the secondary and subordinate powers of Nature, which
            have been anthropomorphized and worshipped as <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“gods”</span> by the common herd of every age. It is
            impossible to conceive anything without a cause; the attempt to
            do so makes the mind a blank. This is virtually the condition to
            which the mind must come at last when we try to trace back the
            chain of causes and effects, but both Science and Religion jump
            to this condition of blankness much more quickly than is
            necessary, for they ignore the metaphysical abstractions which
            are the only conceivable causes of physical concretions. These
            abstractions become more and more concrete as they approach our
            plane of existence, until finally they phenomenalize in the form
            of the material Universe, by a process of conversion of
            metaphysics into physics, analogous to that by which steam can be
            condensed into water, and water frozen into ice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(b) The idea
            of <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternal Non-Being,”</span> which is
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“One Being,”</span> will appear a
            paradox to anyone who does not remember that we limit our ideas
            of Being to our present consciousness of Existence; making it a
            specific, instead of a generic term. An unborn infant, could it
            think in our acceptation of that term, would necessarily in a
            similar manner limit its conception of Being to the intra-uterine
            life which alone it knows; and were it to endeavour to express to
            its consciousness the idea of life after birth (death to it), it
            would, in the absence of data to go upon, and of faculties to
            comprehend such data, probably express that life as <span class="tei tei-q">“Non-Being which is Real Being.”</span> In our case
            the One Being is the noumenon of all the noumena which we know
            must underlie phenomena, and give them whatever shadow of reality
            they possess, but which we have not the senses or the intellect
            to cognize at present. The impalpable atoms of gold scattered
            through the substance of a ton of auriferous quartz may be
            imperceptible to the naked eye of the miner, yet he knows that
            they are not only present there, but that they alone give his
            quartz any appreciable value; and this relation of the gold to
            the quartz may faintly shadow forth that of the noumenon to the
            phenomenon. Only the miner knows what the gold will look like
            when extracted from the quartz, whereas the common mortal can
            form no conception of the reality of things separated from the
            Mâyâ which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg
            077]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg077"></a>
            veils them, and in which they are hidden. Alone the Initiate,
            rich with the lore acquired by numberless generations of his
            predecessors, directs the <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye of
            Dangma”</span> toward the essence of things on which no Mâyâ can
            have any influence. It is here that the teachings of Esoteric
            Philosophy in relation to the Nidânas and the Four Truths become
            of the greatest importance; but they are secret.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(a) The
            tendency of modern thought is to recur to the archaic idea of a
            homogeneous basis for apparently widely different
            things—heterogeneity developed from homogeneity. Biologists are
            now searching for their homogeneous protoplasm and Chemists for
            their protyle, while Science is looking for the force of which
            electricity, magnetism, heat, and so forth, are the
            differentiations. The Secret Doctrine carries this idea into the
            region of metaphysics, and postulates a <span class="tei tei-q">“One Form of Existence”</span> as the basis and
            source of all things. But perhaps the phrase, the <span class="tei tei-q">“One Form of Existence,”</span> is not altogether
            correct. The Sanskrit word is Prabhavâpyaya, <span class="tei tei-q">“the place [or rather plane] whence is the
            origination, and into which is the resolution of all
            things,”</span> as a commentator says. It is not the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of the World,”</span> as translated by
            Wilson;<a href="#note_66" id="noteref_66" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> for
            Jagad Yoni, as shown by Fitzedward Hall, is scarcely so much the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of the World,”</span> or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Womb of the World,”</span> as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Material Cause of the World.”</span> The
            Purânic commentators explain it by Kârana, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cause,”</span> but Esoteric Philosophy, by the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal
            spirit of that cause</span></em>. In its secondary stage, it is
            the Svabhâvat of the Buddhist philosopher, the Eternal Cause and
            Effect, omnipresent yet abstract, the self-existent plastic
            Essence and the Root of all things, viewed in the same dual light
            as the Vedântin views his Parabrahman <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg078"></a> and Mûlaprakriti, the one under two
            aspects. It seems indeed extraordinary to find great scholars
            speculating on the possibility of the Vedânta, and the Uttara
            Mîmânsâ especially, having been <span class="tei tei-q">“evoked
            by the teachings of the Buddhists”</span>; whereas, on the
            contrary, it is Buddhism, the teaching of Gautama Buddha, that
            was <span class="tei tei-q">“evoked”</span> and entirely upreared
            on the tenets of the Secret Doctrine, of which a partial sketch
            is here attempted, and on which, also, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span> are made to

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dreamless Sleep”</span> is one of the

            action; or as a Vedântin would express it, the individual is
            conscious in a different plane of his being. The term
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dreamless Sleep,”</span> in this case,
            is applied allegorically to the Universe to express a condition
            somewhat analogous to that state of consciousness in man, which,
            not being remembered in a waking state, seems a blank, just as
            the sleep of the mesmerized subject seems to him an unconscious
            blank when he returns to his normal condition, although he has

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(a) Here we
            have before us the subject of centuries of scholastic
            disputations. The two terms <span class="tei tei-q">“Âlaya,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Paramârtha,”</span> have been the causes of dividing
            schools and splitting the truth into more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg079"></a> different aspects than any
            other mystic words. Âlaya is the Soul of the World or Anima
            Mundi—the Over-Soul of Emerson—which according to esoteric
            teaching changes its nature periodically. Âlaya, though eternal
            and changeless in its inner essence on the planes which are
            unreachable by either men or cosmic gods (Dhyâni-Buddhas),
            changes during the active life-period with respect to the lower
            planes, ours included. During that time not only the
            Dhyâni-Buddhas are one with Âlaya in Soul and Essence, but even
            the man strong in Yoga (Mystic Meditation) <span class="tei tei-q">“is able to merge his soul with it,”</span> as
            Aryâsanga, of the Yogâchârya school, says. This is not Nirvâna,
            but a condition next to it. Hence the disagreement. Thus, while
            the Yogâchâryas of the Mahâyâna School say that Âlaya (Nyingpo
            and Tsang in Tibetan) is the personification of the Voidness, and
            yet Âlaya is the basis of every visible and invisible thing, and
            that, though it is eternal and immutable in its essence, it
            reflects itself in every object of the Universe <span class="tei tei-q">“like the moon in clear tranquil water”</span>; other
            schools dispute the statement. The same for Paramârtha. The
            Yogâchâryas interpret the term as that which is also dependent
            upon other things (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">paratantra</span></span>); and the
            Madhyamikas say that Paramârtha is limited to Paranishpanna or
            Absolute Perfection; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in the exposition of
            these <span class="tei tei-q">“Two Truths”</span> of the Four,
            the former believe and maintain that, on this plane, at any rate,
            there exists only Samvritisatya or relative truth; and the latter
            teach the existence of Paramârthasatya, Absolute Truth.<a href="#note_71" id="noteref_71" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“No Arhat, O mendicants, can reach
            absolute knowledge before he becomes one with Paranirvâna.
            Parikalpita and Paratantra are his two great
            enemies.”</span><a href="#note_72" id="noteref_72" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
            Parikalpita (in Tibetan Kun-tag) is error, made by those unable
            to realize the emptiness and illusionary nature of all; who
            believe something to exist which does not—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>,
            the Non-Ego. And Paratantra is that, whatever it is, which exists
            only through a dependent or causal connection, and which has to
            disappear as soon as the cause from which it proceeds is
            removed—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>, the flame of a wick.
            Destroy or extinguish it, and light disappears.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Esoteric
            Philosophy teaches that everything lives and is conscious, but
            not that all life and consciousness are similar to those of human
            or even animal beings. Life we look upon as the One Form of
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg080"></a> Existence,
            manifesting in what is called Matter; or what, incorrectly
            separating them, we name Spirit, Soul and Matter in man. Matter
            is the Vehicle for the manifestation of Soul on this plane of
            existence, and Soul is the Vehicle on a higher plane for the
            manifestation of Spirit, and these three are a Trinity
            synthesized by Life, which pervades them all. The idea of
            Universal Life is one of those ancient conceptions which are
            returning to the human mind in this century, as a consequence of
            its liberation from anthropomorphic Theology. Science, it is
            true, contents itself with tracing or postulating the signs of
            Universal Life, but has not yet been bold enough to even whisper
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Anima Mundi”</span>! The idea of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“crystalline life,”</span> now familiar
            to Science, would have been scouted half a century ago. Botanists
            are now searching for the nerves of plants; not that they suppose
            that plants can feel or think as animals do, but because they
            believe that some structure, bearing the same relation
            functionally to plant life that nerves bear to animal life, is
            necessary to explain vegetable growth and nutrition. It seems
            hardly possible that Science, by the mere use of terms such as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“force”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“energy,”</span> can disguise from itself much longer
            the fact that things that have life are living things, whether
            they be atoms or planets.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what is
            the belief of the inner Esoteric Schools, the reader may ask.
            What are the doctrines taught on this subject by the Esoteric
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhists”</span>? With them, we answer,
            Âlaya has a double and even a threefold meaning. In the
            Yogâchârya system of the contemplative Mahâyâna School, Âlaya is
            both the Universal Soul, Anima Mundi, and the Self of a
            progressed Adept. <span class="tei tei-q">“He who is strong in
            the Yoga can introduce at will his Âlaya by means of meditation
            into the true nature of Existence.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The Âlaya has an absolute eternal existence,”</span>

            aspects of itself, one of which is Prakriti, an aspect of
            Pradhâna. <span class="tei tei-q">“Prakriti,”</span> however, is
            an incorrect word, and Âlaya would explain it better; for
            Prakriti is not the <span class="tei tei-q">“uncognizable
            Brahma.”</span> It is a mistake of those who know nothing of the
            universality of the Occult doctrines from the very cradle of the
            human races, and especially so of those scholars who reject the
            very idea of a <span class="tei tei-q">“primordial
            revelation,”</span> to teach that the Anima Mundi, the One Life
            or Universal Soul, was made known only by Anaxagoras, or during
            his age. This philosopher brought the teaching forward simply to
            oppose the too materialistic conceptions of Democritus on
            cosmogony, based on the exoteric theory of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blindly</span></em> driven atoms. Anaxagoras
            of Clazomenæ, however, was not its inventor, but only its
            propagator, as was also Plato. That which he called Mundane
            Intelligence, Nous (Νοῦς), the principle that according to his
            views is absolutely separated and free from matter and acts with
            design, was called Motion, the One Life, or Jîvâtmâ, in India,
            ages before the year 500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Only the Âryan
            philosophers never endowed this principle, which with them is
            infinite, with the finite <span class="tei tei-q">“attribute of
            thinking.”</span><a href="#note_76" id="noteref_76" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This leads
            naturally to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Supreme Spirit”</span>
            of Hegel and the German Transcendentalists—a contrast that it may
            be useful to point out. The schools of Schelling and Fichte have
            diverged widely from the primitive archaic conception of an
            Absolute Principle, and have mirrored an aspect only of the basic
            idea of the Vedânta. Even the <span class="tei tei-q">“Absoluter
            Geist”</span> shadowed forth by von Hartmann in his pessimistic
            philosophy of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unconscious,”</span>
            while it is, perhaps, the closest approximation made by European
            speculation to the Hindû Advaitin doctrines, yet similarly falls
            far short of the reality.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            Hegel, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unconscious”</span> would
            never have undertaken the vast and laborious task of evolving the
            Universe, except in the hope of attaining clear
            Self-Consciousness. In this connection it is to be borne in mind
            that in designating Spirit, a term which the European Pantheists
            use as equivalent to Parabrahman, as Unconscious, they do not
            attach to the expression the connotation it usually bears. It is
            employed in the absence of a better term to symbolize a profound
            mystery.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Absolute Consciousness behind
            phenomena,”</span> they tell us, which is only termed
            unconsciousness in the absence of any element of personality,
            transcends human conception. Man, unable to form a single concept
            except in terms of empirical phenomena, is powerless from the
            very constitution of his being to raise the veil that shrouds the
            majesty of the Absolute. Only the liberated Spirit is able to
            faintly realize the nature of the source whence it sprung and
            whither it must eventually return. As the highest Dhyân Chohan,
            however, can but bow in ignorance before the awful mystery of
            Absolute Being; and since, even in that culmination of conscious
            existence—<span class="tei tei-q">“the merging of the individual
            in the universal consciousness,”</span> to use a phrase of
            Fichte's—the Finite cannot conceive the Infinite, nor can it
            apply to it its own standard of mental experiences, how can it be
            said that the Unconscious and the Absolute can have even an
            instinctive impulse or hope of attaining clear
            Self-Consciousness?<a href="#note_77" id="noteref_77" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> A
            Vedântin, moreover, would never admit this Hegelian idea; and the
            Occultist would say that it applies perfectly to the awakened
            Mahat, the Universal Mind already projected into the phenomenal
            world as the first aspect of the changeless Absolute, but never
            to the latter. <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit and Matter, or
            Purusha and Prakriti, are but the two primeval aspects of the One
            and Secondless,”</span> we are taught.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            matter-moving Nous, the animating Soul, immanent in every atom,
            manifested in man, latent in the stone, has different degrees of
            power; and this Pantheistic idea of a general Spirit-Soul
            pervading all Nature is the oldest of all the philosophical
            notions. Nor was the Archæus a discovery either of Paracelsus or
            of his pupil Van Helmont; for this same Archæus is <span class="tei tei-q">“Father-Æther,”</span> the manifested basis and
            source of the innumerable phenomena of life—localized. The whole
            series of the numberless speculations of this kind are but
            variations on the same theme, the key-note of which was struck in
            this <span class="tei tei-q">“primeval revelation.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(b) The term
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Anupâdaka,”</span> parentless, or
            without progenitors, is a mystical designation having several
            meanings in our philosophy. By this name Celestial Beings, the
            Dhyân Chohans or Dhyâni-Buddhas, are generally meant. These
            correspond mystically to the human Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,
            known as the Mânushi (Human) Buddhas, which latter are also
            designated Anupâdaka, once that their whole personality is merged
            in their compound Sixth and Seventh Principles, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg083"></a> or Âtmâ-Buddhi, and they have
            become the <span class="tei tei-q">“Diamond-Souled”</span>
            (Vajrasattvas<a href="#note_78" id="noteref_78" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>), or
            full Mahâtmâs. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Concealed
            Lord”</span> (Sangbai Dag-po), <span class="tei tei-q">“the one
            merged with the Absolute,”</span> can have no parents since he is
            Self-Existent, and one with the Universal Spirit
            (Svayambhû),<a href="#note_79" id="noteref_79" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> the
            Svabhâvat in its highest aspect. The mystery of the Hierarchy of
            the Anupâdaka is great, its apex being the universal Spirit-Soul,
            and the lower rung the Mânushi-Buddha: and even every
            soul-endowed man also is an Anupâdaka in a latent state.
            Hence—when speaking of the Universe in its formless, eternal, or
            absolute condition, before it was fashioned by the Builders—the
            expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“the great Wheel [Universe]

            creators of the Universe; and in this doctrine, which deals only
            with our Planetary System, they, as the architects of the latter,
            are also called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Watchers”</span> of
            the Seven Spheres, which exoterically are the seven planets, and
            esoterically the seven earths or spheres (Globes) of our Chain
            also. The opening sentence of Stanza I, when mentioning
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Eternities,”</span> applies both
            to the Mahâkalpa or <span class="tei tei-q">“the (Great)
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg084"></a> Age of

            resurrection of our Planetary System on a higher plane. There are
            many kinds of Pralaya (dissolution of a thing visible), as will
            be shown elsewhere.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(b)
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Paranishpanna,”</span> remember, is the
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">summum bonum</span></span>, the Absolute,
            hence the same as Paranirvâna. Besides being the final state, it
            is that condition of subjectivity which has no relation to
            anything but the One Absolute Truth (Paramârthasatya) on its own
            plane. It is that state which leads one to appreciate correctly
            the full meaning of Non-Being, which, as explained, is Absolute
            Being. Sooner or later, all that now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seemingly</span></em> exists, will be in
            reality and actually in the state of Paranishpanna. But there is

            of Paranishpanna, without Paramârtha, the Self-analysing
            Consciousness (Svasamvedâna), is no bliss, but simply extinction
            for Seven Eternities. Thus, an iron ball placed under the
            scorching rays of the sun will get heated through, but will not

            is a fundamental one in Eastern psychology. Under this apparent
            contradiction in terms, there rests a fact of Nature, to realize
            which in the mind, rather than to argue about words, is the
            important thing. A familiar instance of a similar paradox is
            afforded by chemical combination. The question whether hydrogen
            and oxygen cease to exist, when they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg085"></a> combine to form water, is still a moot one;
            some arguing that since they are found again when the water is
            decomposed, they must be there all the while; others contending
            that as they actually turn into something totally different, they
            must cease to exist as themselves for the time being; but neither
            side is able to form the faintest conception of the real
            condition of a thing, which has become something else and yet has
            not ceased to be itself. Existence as water for oxygen and
            hydrogen may be said to be a state of Non-Being, which is more
            real Being than their existence as gases; and it may faintly
            symbolize the condition of the Universe when it goes to sleep, or
            ceases to be, during the Nights of Brahmâ—to awaken or reäppear
            again, when the dawn of the new Manvantara recalls it to what we
            call existence.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath”</span> of the One Existence is
            only used in application to the spiritual aspect of Cosmogony by
            Archaic Esotericism; in other cases, it is replaced by its
            equivalent on the material plane—Motion. The One Eternal Element,
            or element-containing Vehicle, is Space, dimensionless in every
            sense; coëxistent with which are Endless Duration, Primordial
            (hence Indestructible) Matter, and Motion—Absolute <span class="tei tei-q">“Perpetual Motion,”</span> which is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath”</span> of the One Element. This Breath, as
            seen, can never cease, not even during the Pralayic
            Eternities.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the Breath
            of the One Existence does not, all the same, apply to the One
            Causeless Cause or the All-Be-ness, in contradistinction to
            All-Being, which is Brahmâ, or the Universe. Brahmâ, the
            four-faced god, who, after lifting the Earth out of the waters,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“accomplished the creation,”</span> is
            held to be only the Instrumental, and not, as clearly implied,
            the Ideal Cause. No Orientalist, so far, seems to have thoroughly
            comprehended the real sense of the verses in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, that treat of

            these systems, and the nearest exponent of which is the Vedânta
            as expounded by the Advaita Vedântists, none but the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">upâdâna</span></span> can be speculated
            upon. That which is, in the minds of the Vaishnavas (the
            Visishthadvaitas), as the ideal in contradistinction to the
            real—or Parabrahman and Îshvara—can find no room in published
            speculations, since that ideal even is a misnomer, when applied
            to that of which no human reason, even that of an Adept, can
            conceive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To know itself
            or oneself, necessitates consciousness and perception to be
            cognized—both limited faculties in relation to any subject except
            Parabrahman. Hence the <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternal Breath
            which knows itself not.”</span> Infinity cannot comprehend
            Finiteness. The Boundless can have no relation to the Bounded and
            the Conditioned. In the Occult teachings, the Unknown and the
            Unknowable Mover, or the Self-Existing, is the Absolute Divine
            Essence. And thus being Absolute Consciousness, and Absolute
            Motion—to the limited senses of those who describe this
            indescribable—it is unconsciousness and immovableness. Concrete
            consciousness cannot be predicated of abstract consciousness, any
            more than the quality wet can be predicated of water—wetness
            being its own attribute and the cause of the wet quality in other
            things. Consciousness implies limitations and qualifications;
            something to be conscious of, and someone to be conscious of it.
            But Absolute Consciousness contains the cognizer, the thing
            cognized and the cognition, all three in itself and all three
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>. No man is conscious of more
            than that portion of his knowledge which happens to be recalled
            to his mind at any particular time, yet such is the poverty of
            language that we have no term to distinguish the knowledge not
            actively thought of, from knowledge we are unable to recall to
            memory. To forget is synonymous with not to remember. How much
            greater must be the difficulty of finding terms to describe, and
            to distinguish between, abstract metaphysical facts or
            differences! It must not be forgotten, also, that we give names
            to things according to the appearances they assume for ourselves.
            We call Absolute Consciousness <span class="tei tei-q">“unconsciousness,”</span> because it seems to us that
            it must necessarily be so, just as we call the Absolute,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Darkness,”</span> because to our finite
            understanding it appears quite impenetrable; yet we recognize
            fully that our perception <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg087"></a> of such things does not do them justice. We
            involuntarily distinguish in our minds, for instance, between
            unconscious Absolute Consciousness, and unconsciousness, by
            secretly endowing the former with some indefinite quality that
            corresponds, on a higher plane than our thoughts can reach, with
            what we know as consciousness in ourselves. But this is not any
            kind of consciousness that we can manage to distinguish from what
            appears to us as unconsciousness.</p>

            One of the symbolical figures for the Dual Creative Power in
            Nature (matter and force on the material plane) is <span class="tei tei-q">“Padma,”</span> the water-lily of India. The Lotus is
            the product of heat (fire) and water (vapour or ether); fire
            standing in every philosophical and religious system, even in
            Christianity, as a representation of the Spirit of Deity, the
            active, male, generative principle; and ether, or the soul of
            matter, the light of the fire, for the passive female principle,
            from which everything in this Universe emanated. Hence, ether or
            water is the Mother, and fire is the Father. Sir William
            Jones—and before him archaic botany—showed that the seeds of the
            Lotus contain—even before they germinate—perfectly formed leaves,
            with the miniature shape of what one day, as perfect plants, they
            will become: nature thus giving us a specimen of the preformation
            of its production ... the seeds of all phanerogamous plants
            bearing proper flowers containing an embryo plantlet ready
            formed.<a href="#note_89" id="noteref_89" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> This
            explains the sentence, <span class="tei tei-q">“The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg088"></a> Mâtri-Padma had not yet

            root idea in archaic symbology.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lotus, or
            Padma, is, moreover, a very ancient and favourite symbol for the
            Cosmos itself, and also for man. The popular reasons given are,
            firstly, the fact just mentioned, that the Lotus-seed contains
            within itself a perfect miniature of the future plant, which
            typifies the fact that the spiritual prototypes of all things
            exist in the immaterial world, before these things become
            materialized on earth. Secondly, the fact that the Lotus-plant
            grows up through the water, having its root in the Ilus, or mud,
            and spreading its flower in the air above. The Lotus thus
            typifies the life of man and also that of the Cosmos; for the
            Secret Doctrine teaches that the elements of both are the same,
            and that both are developing in the same direction. The root of
            the Lotus sunk in the mud represents material life, the stalk
            passing up through the water typifies existence in the astral
            world, and the flower floating on the water and opening to the
            sky is emblematical of spiritual being.</p>

            lies the origin of the double mystery of the Trinity and the
            Immaculate Conception. The first and fundamental dogma of
            Occultism is Universal Unity (or Homogeneity) under three
            aspects. This leads to a possible conception of Deity, which as

            Absolute Unity would be broken entirely in our conception, had we
            not something concrete before our eyes to contain that Unity. And
            the Deity being absolute, must be omnipresent; hence not an atom
            but contains It within itself. The roots, the trunk, and its many
            branches, are three distinct objects, yet they are one tree. Say
            the Kabalists: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Deity is one, because
            It is infinite. It is triple, because It is ever
            manifesting.”</span> This manifestation is triple in its aspects,
            for it requires, as Aristotle has it, three principles for every
            natural body to become objective: privation, form, and
            matter.<a href="#note_91" id="noteref_91" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
            Privation meant in the mind of the great philosopher that which
            the Occultists call the prototypes impressed in the Astral
            Light—the lowest plane and world of Anima Mundi. The union of
            these three principles depends upon a fourth—the Life which
            radiates from the summits of the Unreachable, to become a
            universally diffused Essence on the manifested planes of
            Existence. And this Quaternary (Father, Mother, Son, as a Unity,
            and a Quaternary—as a living manifestation) has been the means of
            leading to the very archaic idea of Immaculate Conception, now
            finally crystallized into a dogma of the Christian Church, which
            has carnalized this metaphysical idea beyond any common sense.
            For one has but to read the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> and study its
            numerical methods of interpretation to find the origin of the
            dogma. It is purely astronomical, mathematical, and preëminently
            metaphysical: the Male Element in Nature (personified by the male
            deities and Logoi—Virâj, or Brahmâ, Horus, or Osiris, etc., etc.)
            is born through, not from, an immaculate source, personified by
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother,”</span> for—the Abstract
            Deity being sexless, and not even a Being but Be-ness, or Life
            itself—that Male having a <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother”</span>
            cannot have a <span class="tei tei-q">“Father.”</span> Let us

              the birth of a male element from an immaculate source, in other

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus is
            repeated on earth the mystery enacted, according to the Seers, on
            the divine plane. The Son of the Immaculate Celestial Virgin (or
            the Undifferentiated Cosmic Protyle, Matter in its infinitude) is
            born again on earth as the Son of the terrestrial Eve, our mother
            Earth, and becomes Humanity as a total—past, present, and
            future—for Jehovah, or Jod-Hé-Vau-Hé, is androgyne, or both male
            and female. Above, the Son is the whole Kosmos; below, he is
            Mankind. The Triad or Triangle becomes Tetraktys, the sacred
            Pythagorean number, the perfect Square, and a six-faced Cube on
            earth. The Macroprosopus (the Great Face) is now Microprosopus
            (the Lesser Face); or, as the Kabbalists have it, the Ancient of
            Days, descending on Adam Kadmon whom he uses as his vehicle to
            manifest through, gets transformed into Tetragrammaton. It is now

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Thought”</span> does not imply
            the idea of a Divine Thinker. The Universe, not only past,
            present and future—a human and finite idea expressed by finite
            thought—but in its totality, the Sat (an untranslateable term),
            Absolute Being, with the Past and Future crystallized in an
            eternal Present, is that Thought itself reflected in a secondary
            or manifested cause. Brahman (neuter), as the Mysterium Magnum of
            Paracelsus, is an absolute mystery to the human mind. Brahmâ, the
            male-female, the aspect and anthropomorphic reflection of

            The seemingly paradoxical use of the term, <span class="tei tei-q">“Seventh Eternity,”</span> thus dividing the
            indivisible, is sanctified in Esoteric Philosophy. The latter
            divides boundless Duration into unconditionally eternal and
            universal Time (Kâla); and conditioned Time (Khandakâla). One is
            the abstraction or noumenon of infinite Time, the other its
            phenomenon appearing periodically, as the effect of Mahat—the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg092"></a> Universal
            Intelligence, limited by manvantaric duration. With some schools,
            Mahat is the first-born of Pradhâna (undifferentiated Substance,
            or the periodical aspect of Mûlaprakriti, the Root of Nature),
            which (Pradhâna) is called Mâyâ, Illusion. In this respect, I
            believe, Esoteric teaching differs from the Vedântin doctrines of
            both the Advaita and the Visishthadvaita schools. For it says
            that, while Mûlaprakriti, the noumenon, is self-existing and
            without any origin—is, in short, parentless, Anupâdaka, as one
            with Brahman—Prakriti, its phenomenon, is periodical and no
            better than a phantasm of the former; so Mahat, the first-born of
            Jñâna (or Gnôsis), Knowledge, Wisdom or the Logos—is a phantasm
            reflected from the Absolute Nirguna (Parabrahman), the One
            Reality, <span class="tei tei-q">“devoid of attributes and
            qualities”</span>; while with some Vedântins Mahat is a
            manifestation of Prakriti, or Matter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
            Therefore, the <span class="tei tei-q">“last Vibration of the
            Seventh Eternity”</span> was <span class="tei tei-q">“fore-ordained”</span>—by no God in particular, but
            occurred in virtue of the eternal and changeless Law which causes
            the great periods of Activity and Rest, called so graphically,
            and at the same time so poetically, the Days and Nights of
            Brahmâ. The expansion <span class="tei tei-q">“from within
            without”</span> of the Mother, called elsewhere the <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters of Space,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Universal Matrix,”</span> etc., does not allude to
            an expansion from a small centre or focus, but means the
            development of limitless subjectivity into as limitless
            objectivity, without reference to size or limitation or area.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The ever [to us] invisible and immaterial

            implies that this expansion, not being an increase in size—for
            infinite extension admits of no enlargement—was a change of
            condition. It expanded <span class="tei tei-q">“like the Bud of
            the Lotus”</span>; for the Lotus plant exists not only as a
            miniature embryo in its seed (a physical characteristic), but its
            prototype is present in an ideal form in the Astral Light from
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dawn”</span> to <span class="tei tei-q">“Night”</span> during the manvantaric period, like
            everything else, as a matter of fact, in this objective Universe;

            grass.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this,
            teaches the Hidden Science, is but the temporary reflection, the
            shadow of the eternal ideal prototype in Divine Thought; the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Eternity,”</span> note well again,
            standing here only in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">“Æon,”</span> as lasting throughout the seemingly
            interminable, but still limited cycle of activity, called by us
            Manvantara. For what is the real esoteric meaning of Manvantara,
            or rather a Manu-antara? It means, literally, <span class="tei tei-q">“between two Manus,”</span> of whom there are
            fourteen in every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg
            093]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg093"></a>
            Day of Brahmâ, such a Day consisting of 1,000 aggregates of four
            Ages, 1,000 <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Ages”</span> or
            Mahâyugas. Let us now analyse the word or name Manu. Orientalists
            in their dictionaries tell us that the term <span class="tei tei-q">“Manu”</span> is from the root <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“to think”</span>; hence <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            thinking man.”</span> But, esoterically, every Manu, as an
            anthropomorphized patron of his special cycle (or Round), is but
            the personified idea of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Thought
            Divine”</span> (as the Hermetic Pymander); each of the Manus,
            therefore, being the special god, the creator and fashioner of
            all that appears during his own respective cycle of being or
            Manvantara. Fohat runs the Manus' (or Dhyân Chohans') errands,
            and causes the ideal prototypes to expand from within
            without—that is, to cross gradually, on a descending scale, all
            the planes, from the noumenal to the lowest phenomenal, to bloom
            finally on the last into full objectivity—the acme of Illusion,
            or the grossest matter.</p>

            personification of the Eternal Breath of the unconscious All (or
            Parabrahaman) of the Eastern Occultists. The Waters of Life, or
            Chaos—the female principle in symbolism—are the vacuum (to our
            mental sight), in which lie the latent Spirit and Matter. This it
            was that made Democritus assert, after his instructor Leucippus,
            that the primordial principles of all were atoms and a vacuum, in
            the sense of space, but not of empty space, for <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature abhors a vacuum,”</span> according to the

            is employed in Cosmogony with a metaphysical and mystical

            Divine Thought, or Intelligence, impregnating Chaos. This,
            however, occurs on the plane of metaphysical abstraction, or
            rather the plane whereon that which we call a metaphysical
            abstraction, is a reality. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Virgin-Egg,”</span> being in one sense the abstract
            of all ova, or the power of becoming developed through
            fecundation, is eternal and for ever the same. And just as the
            fecundation of an egg takes place before it is dropped; so the
            non-eternal periodical Germ, which later becomes in symbolism the
            Mundane Egg, contains in itself, when it emerges from the said
            symbol, <span class="tei tei-q">“the promise and potency”</span>
            of all the Universe. Though the idea <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
            se</span></span> is, of course, an abstraction, a symbolical mode
            of expression, it is a true symbol, for it suggests the idea of
            infinity as an endless circle. It brings before the mind's eye
            the picture of Kosmos emerging from and in boundless Space, a
            Universe as shoreless in magnitude, if not as endless in its
            objective manifestation. The symbol of an egg also expresses the
            fact taught in Occultism that the primordial form of everything
            manifested, from atom to globe, from man to angel, is spheroidal,
            the sphere being with all nations the emblem of eternity and
            infinity—a serpent swallowing its tail. To realize the meaning,
            however, the sphere must be thought of as seen from its centre.
            The field of vision, or of thought, is like a sphere whose radii
            proceed from one's self in every direction, and extend out into
            space, opening up boundless vistas all around. It is the
            symbolical circle of Pascal and the Kabalists, <span class="tei tei-q">“whose centre is everywhere and circumference
            nowhere”</span>—a conception which enters into the compound idea
            of this emblem.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“World-Egg”</span> is, perhaps, one of
            the most universally adopted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg095"></a> symbols, highly suggestive as it is,
            equally in the spiritual, physiological, and cosmological sense.
            Therefore, it is found in every world-theogony, where it is
            largely associated with the serpent symbol, the latter being
            everywhere, in philosophy as in religious symbolism, an emblem of
            eternity, infinitude, regeneration, and rejuvenation, as well as
            of wisdom. The mystery of apparent self-generation and evolution
            through its own creative power, repeating in miniature, in the
            egg, the process of cosmic evolution—both due to heat and
            moisture under the efflux of the unseen creative spirit—fully
            justified the selection of this graphic symbol. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Virgin-Egg”</span> is the microcosmic symbol of the

            it could have no other representation than a spheroid. The Golden

            through Initiation. The former are but conventional glyphs; the
            latter, the basic symbols of all. That is to say, the one are
            purely physical, the other purely metaphysical, the two standing
            in relation to each other as Matter stands to Spirit—the extreme
            poles of the One Substance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Balzac, the
            unconscious Occultist of French literature, says somewhere, the
            Number is to Mind the same as it is to Matter, <span class="tei tei-q">“an incomprehensible agent.”</span> Perhaps so to the
            profane, never to the initiated mind. Number is, as the great
            writer thought, an Entity, and, at the same time, a Breath
            emanating from what he called God and what we call the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>, the Breath which
            alone could organize the physical Cosmos, <span class="tei tei-q">“where naught obtains its form but through the Deity,
            which is an effect of Number.”</span> It is instructive to quote
            Balzac's words upon this subject:</p>

            proven to our mind, but of which no proof can be physically
            given. The mathematician will tell us that the infinitude of

            point of view this is easy of explanation: it is the Milky Way,
            the World-Stuff, or Primordial Matter in its first form. It is
            more difficult, however, to explain it in a few words, or even
            lines, from the standpoint of Occult Science and Symbolism, as it
            is the most complicated of glyphs. Herein are enshrined more than
            a dozen symbols. To begin with, it contains the whole pantheon of
            mysterious objects,<a href="#note_102" id="noteref_102" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>
            every one of them having some <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg097"></a> definite Occult meaning, extracted from the
            Hindû allegorical <span class="tei tei-q">“Churning of the
            Ocean”</span> by the Gods. Besides Amrita, the water of life or
            immortality, Surabhi, the <span class="tei tei-q">“cow of
            plenty,”</span> called <span class="tei tei-q">“the fountain of
            milk and curds,”</span> was extracted from this <span class="tei tei-q">“sea of milk.”</span> Hence the universal adoration
            of the cow and bull, one the productive, the other the generative
            power in Nature: symbols connected with both the solar and the
            cosmic deities. The specific properties, for Occult purposes, of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“fourteen precious things,”</span>
            being explained only at the Fourth Initiation, cannot be given
            here; but the following may be remarked. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shatapatha
            Brâhmana</span></span> it is stated that the Churning of the
            Ocean of Milk took place in the Satya Yuga, the first Age which
            immediately followed the <span class="tei tei-q">“Deluge.”</span>
            As, however, neither the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span> nor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manu</span></span>—both preceding
            Vaivasvata's <span class="tei tei-q">“Deluge,”</span> that of the
            bulk of the Fourth Race—mention this Deluge, it is evident that
            it is neither the Great Deluge, nor that which carried away
            Atlantis, nor even the Deluge of Noah, which is here meant. This
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Churning”</span> relates to a period
            before the earth's formation, and is in direct connection with
            another universal legend, the various and contradictory versions
            of which culminated in the Christian dogma of the <span class="tei tei-q">“War in Heaven,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall of the Angels.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span>, reproached by the

            reawakening of cosmic motion, scattered through Space; appearing,
            when seen from the Earth, in clusters and lumps, like curds in

            antiquity. It is only by some sects in China that he is

            Cronus-Saturn, <span class="tei tei-q">“Infinite Time”</span>
            (Kâla), in their origin were represented as male-female. Zeus is
            said to be the <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful virgin,”</span>

            now connected with Jesus, is hermaphrodite, for he is described
            as having female breasts. So also is Tetragrammaton, or Jehovah.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No religious
            symbol can escape profanation and even derision in our days of
            politics and science. In Southern India the writer has seen a
            converted native making pûjâ with offerings before a statue of
            Jesus clad in woman's clothes and with a ring in its nose. On
            asking the meaning of this masquerade, we were answered that it
            was Jesu-Maria blended in one, and that it was done by the
            permission of the Padre, as the zealous convert had no money to
            purchase two statues, or <span class="tei tei-q">“idols”</span>
            as they, very properly, were called by a witness, another but a
            non-converted Hindû. Blasphemous this will appear to a dogmatic
            Christian, but the Theosophist and the Occultist must award the
            palm of logic to the converted Hindû. The esoteric Christos in
            the Gnôsis is, of course, sexless, but in exoteric Theology he is
            male and female.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(b) The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Dragon of Wisdom”</span> is the One, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Eka”</span> or Saka. It is curious that
            Jehovah's name in Hebrew should also be One, Achad. <span class="tei tei-q">“His name is Achad,”</span> say the Rabbins. The
            Philologists ought to decide which of the two is derived from the
            other, linguistically and symbolically; surely, not the Sanskrit.
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“One”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dragon”</span> are expressions used by the ancients
            in connection with their respective Logoi. Jehovah—esoterically
            Elohim—is also the Serpent or Dragon that tempted Eve; and the
            Dragon is an old glyph for the Astral Light (Primordial
            Principle), <span class="tei tei-q">“which is the Wisdom of
            Chaos.”</span> Archaic philosophy, recognizing neither Good nor
            Evil as a fundamental or independent power, but starting from the
            Absolute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span> (Universal
            Perfection eternally), traces both through the course of natural
            evolution to pure Light condensing gradually into form, and hence
            becoming Matter or Evil. It was left with the early and ignorant
            Christian Fathers to degrade the philosophical and highly
            scientific idea of this emblem into the absurd superstition
            called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Devil.”</span> They took this
            from the later Zoroastrians, who saw Devils or Evil in the Hindû
            Devas, and the word Evil has become by a double transmutation
            D'Evil (Diabolos, Diable, Diavolo, Teufel). But the Pagans have
            always shown a philosophical discrimination in their symbols. The
            primitive symbol of the serpent symbolized divine Wisdom and
            Perfection, and has always stood for psychical Regeneration and
            Immortality. Hence, Hermes calling the serpent the most spiritual
            of all beings; Moses, initiated into the Wisdom of Hermes,
            following suit in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>; the Gnostic Serpent
            with the seven vowels over its head, being the emblem of the
            Seven Hierarchies of the Septenary or Planetary Creators. Hence,
            also, the Hindû serpent Shesha or Ananta, the Infinite, a name of
            Vishnu, and his first Vâhana, or Vehicle, on the Primordial
            Waters. Like the Logoi and the Hierarchies of Powers, however,
            these serpents have to be distinguished one from the other.
            Shesha or Ananta, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Couch of
            Vishnu,”</span> is an allegorical abstraction, symbolizing
            infinite Time in Space, which contains the Germ and throws off
            periodically the efflorescence of this Germ, the Manifested
            Universe; whereas, the Gnostic Ophis contains the same triple
            symbolism in its seven vowels as the one, three and
            seven-syllabled Oeaohoo of the archaic doctrine; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            the First Unmanifested Logos, the Second Manifested, the Triangle
            concreting into the Quaternary or Tetragrammaton, and the Rays of
            the latter on the material plane.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg103"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet they all
            made a difference between the good and the bad Serpent (the
            Astral Light of the Kabalists)—between the former, the embodiment
            of divine Wisdom in the region of the Spiritual, and the latter,
            Evil, on the plane of Matter. For the Astral Light, or the Ether,
            of the ancient Pagans—the name Astral Light is quite modern—is
            Spirit-Matter. Beginning with the pure spiritual plane, it
            becomes grosser as it descends, until it becomes Mâyâ, or the
            tempting and deceitful Serpent on our plane.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jesus accepted
            the serpent as a synonym of Wisdom, and this formed part of his
            teaching: <span class="tei tei-q">“Be ye wise as
            serpents,”</span> he says. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">In the beginning,

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aitareya Brahmana</span></span> calls the

            Queen,”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of all
            that moves.”</span> Before our globe became egg-shaped (and the
            Universe also), <span class="tei tei-q">“a long trail of cosmic
            dust [or fire-mist] moved and writhed like a serpent in
            Space.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of God moving
            on Chaos”</span> was symbolized by every nation in the shape of a
            fiery serpent breathing fire and light upon the primordial
            waters, until it had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume
            the annular shape of a serpent with its tail in its mouth—which
            symbolizes not only eternity and infinitude, but also the
            globular shape of all the bodies formed within the Universe from
            that fiery mist. The Universe, as also the Earth and Man,
            serpent-like, periodically cast off their old skins, to assume
            new ones after a time of rest. The serpent is surely not a less
            graceful or a more unpoetical image than the caterpillar and
            chrysalis from which springs the butterfly, the Greek emblem of
            Psyche, the human soul! The Dragon was also the symbol of the
            Logos with the Egyptians, as with the Gnostics. In the

            which means that the Primordial Electric Entity—for the Eastern

            life, and separates primordial stuff or pregenetic matter into

            played such a prominent part in the Mysteries. Its universal
            value is nine, for it is the ninth letter of the alphabet, and
            the ninth door of the fifty portals, or gateways, that lead to
            the concealed mysteries of being. It is the magical agent
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span>, and designates
            in Hermetic philosophy <span class="tei tei-q">“Life infused into
            Primordial Matter,”</span> the essence that composes all things,
            and the spirit that determines their form. But there are two
            secret Hermetical operations, one spiritual, the other material,
            correlative and for ever united. As Hermes says:</p>

            Heraclitus of Ephesus maintained that the one principle that

            moves the Universe is fire, and fire is intelligence. And while

            of the teacher to the pupil, contains in a single phrase one of
            the most essential truths of Occult Philosophy. It indicates the
            existence of things imperceptible to our physical senses which
            are of far greater importance, more real and more permanent, than
            those that appeal to these senses themselves. Before the Lanoo
            can hope to understand the transcendentally metaphysical problem
            contained in the first question, he must be able to answer the
            second; while the very answer he gives to the second will furnish
            him with the clue to the correct reply to the first.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            Sanskrit Commentary on this Stanza, the terms used for the
            concealed and the unrevealed Principle are many. In the earliest
            MSS. of Indian literature this Unrevealed Abstract Deity has no
            name. It is generally called <span class="tei tei-q">“That”</span> (Tad, in Sanskrit), and means all that
            is, was, and will be, or that can be so received by the human
            mind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among such
            appellations given—of course, only in Esoteric Philosophy—as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Unfathomable Darkness,”</span> the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Whirlwind,”</span> etc., it is also
            called the <span class="tei tei-q">“It of the Kâlahansa,”</span>
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Kâla-ham-sa,”</span> and even the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Kâli Hamsa”</span> (Black Swan). Here
            the m and the n are convertible, and both sound like the nasal
            French an or am. As in the Hebrew so also in the Sanskrit many a
            mysterious sacred name conveys to the profane ear no more than
            some ordinary, and often vulgar word, because it is concealed
            anagrammatically or otherwise. This word Hansa, or Hamsa, is just
            such a case. Hamsa is equal to <span class="tei tei-q">“A-ham-sa”</span>—three words meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“I am He”</span>; while divided in still another way
            it will read <span class="tei tei-q">“So-ham,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“He [is] I.”</span> In this single word
            is contained, for him who understands the language of wisdom, the
            universal mystery, the doctrine of the identity of man's essence
            with god-essence. Hence the glyph of, and the allegory about,
            Kâlahansa (or Hamsa), and the name given to Brahman (neuter),
            later on to the male Brahmâ, of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg107"></a> Hamsa-vâhana, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
            who uses the Hamsa as his vehicle.”</span> The same word may be
            read <span class="tei tei-q">“Kâlaham-sa,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“I am I, in the eternity of time,”</span> answering
            to the Biblical, or rather Zoroastrian, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am that I am.”</span> The same doctrine is found
            in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, as witness the
            following extract from an unpublished MS. by Mr. S. Liddell
            McGregor Mathers, the learned Kabalist:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">He,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">is applied to the hidden and concealed

              seq</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.) It is to be
              noted that each of these names consists of three letters, of
              which the letter Aleph א, A, forms the conclusion of the first
              word Hua, and the commencement of Atah and Ani, as if it were
              the connecting link between them. But א is the symbol of the
              Unity and consequently of the unvarying Idea of the Divine
              operating through all these. But behind the א in the name Hua
              are the letters ו and ה, the symbols of the numbers Six and
              Five, the Male and the Female, the Hexagram and the Pentagram.
              And the numbers of these three words, Hua, Ateh, Ani, are 12,
              406, and 61, which are resumed in the key numbers of 3, 10, and
              7, by the Qabalah of the Nine Chambers which is a form of the
              exegetical rule of Temura.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is useless
            to attempt to explain the mystery in full. Materialists and the
            men of Modern Science will never understand it, since, in order
            to obtain clear perception of it, one has first of all to admit
            the postulate of a universally diffused, omnipresent, eternal
            Deity in Nature; secondly, to have fathomed the mystery of
            electricity in its true essence; and thirdly, to credit man with
            being the septenary symbol, on the terrestrial plane, of the One
            Great Unit, the Logos, which is Itself the seven-vowelled sign,
            the Breath crystallized into the Word.<a href="#note_125" id="noteref_125" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a> He
            who believes in all this, has also to believe in the multiple
            combination of the seven planets of Occultism and of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, with the twelve
            zodiacal signs; and attribute, as we do, to each planet and to
            each constellation an influence which, in the words of Mr. Ely
            Star (a French astrologer), <span class="tei tei-q">“is proper to
            it, beneficent or maleficent, and this, after the planetary
            spirit which rules it, who, in his turn, is capable of
            influencing men and things which are found in harmony with him
            and with which he has any affinity.”</span> For these reasons,
            and since few believe in the foregoing, all that can now be given
            is that in both cases <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg
            108]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg108"></a>
            the symbol of Hansa (whether I, He, Goose or Swan) is an
            important symbol, representing, among other things, Divine
            Wisdom, Wisdom in Darkness beyond the reach of men. For all
            exoteric purposes, Hansa, as every Hindû knows, is a fabulous
            bird which, when (in the allegory) given milk mixed with water
            for its food, separated the two, drinking the milk and leaving
            the water; thus showing inherent wisdom—milk standing
            symbolically for spirit, and water for matter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this
            allegory is very ancient and dates from the very earliest archaic
            period, is shown by the mention, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhâgavata
            Purâna</span></span>, of a certain caste named Hamsa or Hansa,
            which was the <span class="tei tei-q">“one caste”</span>
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par excellence</span></span>; when far back
            in the mists of a forgotten past there was among the Hindûs only
            <span class="tei tei-q">“One Veda, One Deity, One Caste.”</span>
            There is also a range in the Himâlayas, described in the old
            books as being situated north of Mount Meru, called Hamsa, and
            connected with episodes pertaining to the history of religious
            mysteries and initiations. As to Kâlahansa being the supposed
            Vehicle of Brahmâ-Prajâpati, in the exoteric texts and
            translations of the Orientalists, it is quite a mistake. Brahman,
            the neuter, is called by them Kâla-hansa, and Brahmâ, the male,
            Hansa-vâhana, because, forsooth, <span class="tei tei-q">“his
            vehicle is a swan or goose.”</span><a href="#note_126" id="noteref_126" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a>
            This is a purely exoteric gloss. Esoterically and logically, if
            Brahman, the infinite, is all that is described by the
            Orientalists, and, agreeably with the Vedântic texts, is an
            abstract deity, in no way characterized by the ascription of any
            human attributes, and at the same time it is maintained that he
            or it is called Kâlahansa—then how can it ever become the Vâhan
            of Brahmâ, the manifested finite god? It is quite the reverse.
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“Swan or Goose”</span> (Hansa) is the
            symbol of the male or temporary deity, Brahmâ, the emanation of
            the primordial Ray, which is made to serve as a Vâhan or Vehicle
            for the Divine Ray, which otherwise could not manifest itself in
            the Universe, being, antiphrastically, itself an emanation of
            Darkness—for our human intellect, at any rate. It is Brahmâ,
            then, who is Kâlahansa, and the Ray, Hansa-vâhana.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the
            strange symbol thus chosen, it is equally suggestive; the true
            mystic significance being the idea of a Universal Matrix, figured
            by the Primordial Waters of the Deep, or the opening for the
            reception, and subsequently for the issuing, of that One Ray (the
            Logos) which contains in itself the other Seven Procreative Rays
            or Powers (the Logoi or Builders). Hence the choice by the
            Rosecroix of the aquatic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg109"></a> fowl—whether swan or pelican<a href="#note_127" id="noteref_127" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a>—with
            seven young ones, for a symbol, modified and adapted to the
            religion of every country. Ain Suph is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery Soul of the Pelican”</span> in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
            Numbers</span></span>.<a href="#note_128" id="noteref_128" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>
            Appearing with every Manvantara as Nârâyana, or Svâyambhuva, the
            Self-Existent, and penetrating into the Mundane Egg, it emerges
            from it at the end of the divine incubation as Brahmâ, or
            Prajâpati, the progenitor of the future Universe, into which he
            expands. He is Purusha (Spirit), but he is also Prakriti
            (Matter). Therefore it is only after separating itself into two
            halves—Brahmâ-Vâch (the female) and Brahmâ-Virâj (the male)—that
            the Prajâpati becomes the male Brahmâ.</p>

            Astral Fluid, the Athanor of the Alchemists, at the lower; God
            and Devil, Good and Evil.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, why is
            Light called <span class="tei tei-q">“Cold Flame”</span>? In the
            order of Cosmic Evolution (as taught by the Occultist), the
            energy that actuates matter, after its first formation into
            atoms, is generated on our plane by Cosmic Heat; and before that
            period Cosmos, in the sense of dissociated matter, was not. The
            first Primordial Matter, eternal and coëval with Space,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">which has neither a beginning nor an end,
            [is] neither hot nor cold, but is of its own special
            nature</span></span>,”</span> says the Commentary. Heat and cold
            are relative qualities and pertain to the realms of the
            manifested worlds, which all proceed from the manifested Hyle,
            which, in its absolutely latent aspect, is referred to as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Cold Virgin,”</span> and when awakened
            to life, as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother.”</span> The
            ancient Western cosmogonic myths state that at first there was
            only cold mist (the Father) and the prolific slime (the Mother,
            Ilus or Hyle), from which crept forth the Mundane Snake
            (Matter).<a href="#note_131" id="noteref_131" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a>
            Primordial Matter, then, before it emerges from the plane of the
            never-manifesting, and awakens to the thrill of action under the
            impulse of Fohat, is but <span class="tei tei-q">“a cool
            radiance, colourless, formless, tasteless, and devoid of every
            quality and aspect.”</span> Even such are her First-born, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Four Sons,”</span> who <span class="tei tei-q">“are One, and become Seven,”</span>—the Entities, by
            whose qualifications and names the ancient Eastern Occultists
            called the four of the seven primal <span class="tei tei-q">“Centres of Force,”</span> or Atoms, that develop
            later into the great Cosmic <span class="tei tei-q">“Elements,”</span> now divided into the seventy or so
            sub-elements, known to Science. The four <span class="tei tei-q">“Primal Natures”</span> of the first Dhyân Chohans
            are the so-called (for want of better terms) Âkâshic, Ethereal,
            Watery and Fiery. They answer, in the terminology of practical
            Occultism, to the scientific definitions of gases, which—to
            convey a clear idea to both Occultists and laymen—may be defined
            as parahydrogenic,<a href="#note_132" id="noteref_132" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
            paraoxygenic, oxyhydrogenic, and ozonic, or perhaps nitrozonic;
            the latter forces, or gases (in Occultism, supersensuous, yet
            atomic substances), being the most effective and active when
            energizing on the plane of more grossly differentiated matter.
            These elements are both electro-positive and electro-negative.
            These and many more are probably the missing links of Chemistry.
            They are known by other names in Alchemy and to Occultists who
            practise phenomenal powers. It is by combining and recombining,
            or dissociating, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elements”</span>

            contraction and expansion of the infinite and shoreless Ocean, of
            that which we may call the noumenon of Matter, emanated by
            Svabhâvat, which causes the universal vibration of atoms. But it
            is also suggestive of something else. It shows that the ancients
            were acquainted with that which is now the puzzle of many
            Scientists and especially of Astronomers—the cause of the first
            ignition of matter, or world-stuff, the paradox of the heat
            produced by refrigerative contraction, and other such cosmic
            riddles—for it points unmistakably to a knowledge by the ancients
            of such phenomena. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">There is heat
            internal and heat external in every atom</span></span>,”</span>
            say the MSS. Commentaries, to which the writer has had access,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Breath of the Father [Spirit], and the
            Breath [or Heat] of the Mother [Matter]</span></span>”</span>;
            and they give explanations which show that the modern theory of
            the extinction of the solar fires, by loss of heat through
            radiation, is erroneous. The assumption is false even on the
            Scientists' own admission. For, as Professor Newcomb<a href="#note_141" id="noteref_141" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>
            points out, <span class="tei tei-q">“by losing heat a gaseous
            body contracts, and the heat generated by the contraction exceeds
            that which it had to lose in order to produce the
            contraction.”</span> This paradox, that a body gets hotter, as
            the shrinking produced by its getting colder is greater, has led
            to long disputes. The surplus of heat, it is argued, is lost by
            radiation, and to assume that the temperature is not lowered
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pari passu</span></span> with a decrease of
            volume under a constant pressure, is to set at naught the law of
            Charles. Contraction develops heat, it is true; but contraction
            (from cooling) is incapable of developing the whole amount of
            heat at any time existing in the mass, or even of maintaining a
            body at a constant temperature, etc. Professor Winchell tries to
            reconcile the paradox—only a seeming one in fact, as J. Homer
            Lane<a href="#note_142" id="noteref_142" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a>
            proved—by suggesting <span class="tei tei-q">“something
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg113"></a> besides
            heat.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“May it not be,”</span> he
            asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“simply a repulsion among the

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Fire,”</span> etc.
            Shankarâchârya, the greatest of the Esoteric Masters of India,
            says that Fire means a deity which presides over Time (Kâla). The
            able translator of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavadgîtâ</span></span>, Kâshinâth
            Trimbak Telang, M.A., of Bombay, confesses he has <span class="tei tei-q">“no clear notion of the meaning of these
            verses.”</span> It seems quite clear, on the contrary, to him who
            knows the Occult doctrine. With these verses the mystic sense of
            the solar and lunar symbols are connected. The Pitris are Lunar
            Deities and our Ancestors, because they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created the
            physical man</span></em>. The Agnishvatta, the Kumâras (the Seven
            Mystic Sages), are Solar Deities, though they are Pitris also;
            and these are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fashioners of the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inner</span></em> Man.”</span> They are
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Sons of Fire,”</span> because they
            are the first Beings, called <span class="tei tei-q">“Minds,”</span> in the Secret Doctrine, evolved from
            Primordial Fire. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord ... is a

            not regarded as matter, but is the unity of Æther—the second,
            manifested deity—in its universality. But there <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg115"></a> are two <span class="tei tei-q">“Fires,”</span> and a distinction is made between
            them in the Occult teachings. The first, or the purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">formless</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invisible</span></em> Fire, concealed in the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Central

            (metaphysically); while the Fire of the Manifested Cosmos is
            Septenary, throughout both the Universe and our Solar System.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The fire of knowledge burns up all action on

            and philosophical tenet just explained in the commentary on
            Shloka 4 of Stanza III. That which is absolute, is of course
            No-Number; but in its later significance it has an application
            both in Space and in Time. It means that not only every increment
            of time is part of a larger increment, up to the most
            indefinitely prolonged duration conceivable by the human
            intellect, but also that no manifested thing can be thought of
            except as part of a whole: the total aggregate being the One
            Manifested Universe that issues from the Unmanifested or
            Absolute—called Non-Being, or <span class="tei tei-q">“No-Number,”</span> to distinguish it from Being, or

            hardly be skimmed, even in such a large work as the present. It
            is on the Hierarchies and the correct numbers of these
            Beings—invisible (to us) except upon very rare occasions—that the
            mystery of the whole Universe is built. The Kumâras, for
            instance, are called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Four”</span>—though in reality seven in
            number—because Sanaka, Sananda, Sanâtana and Sanatkumâra are the
            chief Vaidhâtra (their patronymic name), <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg117"></a> who sprang from the <span class="tei tei-q">“four-fold mystery.”</span> To make the whole
            clearer, we have to turn for our illustrations to tenets more
            familiar to some of our readers, namely the Brâhmanical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manu</span></span>, Hiranyagarbha is Brahmâ,
            the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">male</span></em>, formed by the
            undiscernible Causeless Cause, in a <span class="tei tei-q">“Golden Egg resplendent as the Sun,”</span> as states
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hindû Classical Dictionary</span></span>;
            Hiranyagarbha meaning the Golden, or rather the Effulgent, Womb
            or Egg. The meaning tallies awkwardly with the epithet
            <span class="tei tei-q">“male.”</span> Surely the esoteric
            meaning of the sentence is clear enough! In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig
            Veda</span></span> it is said—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span>, the one Lord of
            all beings ... the one animating principle of gods and
            men,”</span> arose, in the beginning, in the Golden Womb,
            Hiranyagarbha—which is the Mundane Egg, or Sphere of our
            Universe. That Being is surely androgynous, and the allegory of
            Brahmâ separating into two, and creating in one of his halves
            (the female Vâch) himself as Virâj, is a proof of it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The One from the Egg, the Six and the Five,”</span>
            give the number 1065, the value of the First-born (later on the
            male and female Brahmâ-Prajâpati), who answers to the numbers 7,
            and 14, and 21 respectively. The Prajâpati, like the Sephiroth
            are only seven, including the synthetic Sephira of the Triad from
            which they spring. Thus from Hiranyagarbha, or Prajâpati, the
            Triune (the primeval Vedic Trimûrti, Agni, Vâyu, and Sûrya),
            emanate the other seven, or again ten, if we separate the first
            three which exist in one, and one in three; all, moreover, being
            comprehended within that one <span class="tei tei-q">“Supreme,”</span> Parama, called Guhya or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Secret,”</span> and Sarvâtman, the

            with the Sephiroth. They are either seven when counting from the
            upper Triad, headed by Kether, or ten—exoterically. In the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mahâbhârata</span></span>, the Prajâpati are
            21 in number, or ten, six, and five (1065), thrice seven.<a href="#note_159" id="noteref_159" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a></p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Rope”</span> that hedges off the
            phenomenal from the noumenal Cosmos, which does not fall within
            the range of our present objective consciousness—this number,
            when not enlarged by permutation and expansion, is ever 31415,
            anagrammatically and Kabalistically, being both the number of the
            Circle and the mystic Svastika, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Twice Seven”</span> once more; for whatever way the
            two sets of figures are counted, when added separately, one
            figure after another, whether crossways from right, or from left,
            they will always yield fourteen. Mathematically they represent
            the well-known mathematical formula, that the ratio of the
            diameter of a circle to the circumference is as 1 to 3.1415, or
            the value of π (pi), as it is called. This set of figures must
            have the same meaning, since the 1:314,159 and again 1:3.1415927
            are worked out in the secret calculations to express the various
            cycles and ages of the <span class="tei tei-q">“First-born,”</span> or 311,040,000,000,000 with
            fractions, and yield the same 1.3415 by a process we are not
            concerned with at present. And it may be shown that Mr. Ralston
            Skinner, the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Source of Measures</span></span>, reads
            the Hebrew word Alhim in the same number values—by omitting, as
            said, the ciphers, and by permutation—13514: since א (a) is 1; ל
            (l) is 3 (30); ה (h) is 5; י (i) is 1 (10); and מ (m) is 4 (40);
            and anagrammatically—31415, as explained by him.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, while in
            the metaphysical world, the Circle with the one central Point in
            it has no number, and is called Anupâdaka—parentless and
            numberless, for it can fall under no calculation; in the
            manifested world, the Mundane Egg or Circle is circumscribed
            within the groups called the Line, the Triangle, the Pentagram,
            the second Line and the Square (or 13514); and when the Point has
            generated a Line, and thus becomes a diameter which stands for
            the androgynous Logos, then the figures become 31415, or a
            triangle, a line, a square, a second line, and a pentagram.

            corroborated by the significant fact that Anna, the name of the

            Church as having given birth to her daughter in an immaculate way
            (<span class="tei tei-q">“Mary conceived without sin”</span>), is
            derived from the Chaldean Ana, Heaven, or Astral Light, Anima

            but it is useless to give their ancient names, as it would only
            create confusion. Many of these may be now also found even in the
            Christian Hierarchy of divine and celestial Powers. All those
            Thrones and Dominions, Virtues and Principalities, Cherubs,
            Seraphs and Demons, the various denizens of the Sidereal World,
            are the modern copies of archaic prototypes. The very symbolism
            in their names, when transliterated and arranged, in Greek and
            Latin, are sufficient to show it, as will be proved in several
            cases further on.</p>

            meaning—a very profound one, too—on the page of the origins of
            Life. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sepher Jetzirah</span></span> it is stated
            that: <span class="tei tei-q">“God engraved in the Holy Four the

            Shloka gives again a brief analysis of the Hierarchies of the
            Dhyân Chohans, called Devas (Gods) in India, or the Conscious
            Intelligent Powers in Nature. To this Hierarchy correspond the
            actual types into which Humanity may be divided; for Humanity, as
            a whole, is in reality a materialized, though as yet imperfect,
            expression thereof. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Army of the
            Voice”</span> is a term closely connected with the mystery of
            Sound and Speech, as an effect and corollary of the Cause—Divine
            Thought. As beautifully expressed by P. Christian, the learned
            author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Histoire de la Magie</span></span> and

            effect of a preceding cause, and a combination of these very
            often produces the most magical effect. The vowels, especially,

            conversation is given between a Brâhmana and his wife on the
            origin of Speech and its Occult properties. The wife asks how
            Speech came into existence, and which was prior to the other,
            Speech or Mind. The Brâhmana tells her that the Apâna (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inspirational</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg122"></a><span style="font-style: italic">breath</span></em>) becoming lord, changes
            that intelligence, which does not understand Speech or Words,
            into the state of Apâna, and thus opens the Mind. Thereupon he
            tells her a story, a dialogue between Speech and Mind. Both went
            to the Self of Being (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, to the individual Higher
            Self, as Nîlakantha thinks; to Prajâpati, according to the
            commentator Arjuna Mishra), and asked him to destroy their
            doubts, and decide which of them preceded and was superior to the
            other. To this the Lord said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind (is
            superior).”</span> But Speech answered the Self of Being, by
            saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“I verily yield (you) your
            desires,”</span> meaning that by Speech he acquired what he
            desired. Thereupon again, the Self told her that there are two
            Minds, the <span class="tei tei-q">“movable”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“immovable.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The immovable is with me,”</span> he said,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the movable is in your dominion”</span>
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> of Speech), on the plane

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">proudly), therefore, O Sarasvatî!
              you shall never speak after (hard) exhalation. The goddess
              Speech [Sarasvatî, a later form or aspect of Vâch, the goddess
              also of secret learning, or Esoteric Wisdom], verily, dwelt
              always between the Prâna and the Apâna. But, O noble one! going
              with the Apâna wind [vital air], though impelled, ... without
              the Prâna [expirational breath], she ran up to Prajâpati
              [Brahmâ], saying,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Be
              pleased, O venerable sir!</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">Then the Prâna appeared again nourishing
              Speech. And, therefore, Speech never speaks after (hard)
              exhalation. It is always noisy or noiseless. Of these two, the
              noiseless is the superior to the noisy (Speech).... The
              (Speech) which is produced in the body by means of the Prâna,
              and which then goes [is transformed] into Apâna and then
              becoming assimilated with the Udâna [physical organs of Speech]
              ... then finally dwells in the Samâna [</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">at the navel in the form of sound, as the
              material cause of all words,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">says Arjuna Mishra]. So Speech formerly spoke.
              Hence the Mind is distinguished by reason of its being
              immovable, and the Goddess (Speech) by reason of her being
              movable.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above
            allegory is at the root of the Occult law, which prescribes
            silence upon the knowledge of certain secret and invisible
            things, perceptible only to the spiritual mind (the sixth sense),
            and which cannot be expressed by <span class="tei tei-q">“noisy”</span> or uttered speech. This chapter of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Anugîtâ</span></span> explains, says Arjuna
            Mishra, Prânâyâma, or regulation of the breath in Yoga practices.
            This mode, however, without the previous acquisition of, or at
            least full understanding of, the two higher senses (of which
            there are seven, as will be shown), pertains rather to the lower
            Yoga. The Hatha so called was and still is discountenanced by the
            Arhats. It is injurious to the health, and alone can never
            develop <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg
            123]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg123"></a>
            into Râja Yoga. This story is quoted to show how inseparably
            connected in the metaphysics of old, are intelligent beings, or
            rather <span class="tei tei-q">“intelligences,”</span> with every
            sense or function, whether physical or mental. The Occult claim
            that there are seven senses in man, and in nature, as there are
            seven states of consciousness, is corroborated in the same work,
            Chapter vii, on Pratyâhâra (the restraint and regulation of the
            senses, Prânâyâma being that of the <span class="tei tei-q">“vital winds”</span> or breath). The Brâhmana,
            speaking of the institution of the seven sacrificial Priests
            (Hotris), says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The nose and the eye,
            and the tongue, and the skin and the ear as the fifth [or smell,
            sight, taste, touch, and hearing], mind and understanding are the
            seven sacrificial priests separately stationed,”</span> which
            <span class="tei tei-q">“dwelling in a minute space (still) do
            not perceive each other,”</span> on this sensuous plane, none of
            them except mind. For mind says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
            nose smells not without me, the eye does not take in colour,
            etc., etc. I am the eternal chief among all elements
            [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, senses]. Without me, the
            senses never shine, like an empty dwelling, or like fires the
            flames of which are extinct. Without me, all beings, like fuel
            half dried and half moist, fail to apprehend qualities or objects
            even with the senses exerting themselves.”</span><a href="#note_165" id="noteref_165" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">165</span></span></a></p>

            about their respective superiority and their taking the Brahman,
            the Lord of all creatures, for their arbiter. <span class="tei tei-q">“You are all greatest and not greatest [or superior

            Next we see Cosmic Matter scattering and forming itself into
            Elements; grouped into the mystic Four within the fifth
            Element—Ether, the <span class="tei tei-q">“lining”</span> of
            Âkâsha, the Anima Mundi, or Mother of Cosmos. <span class="tei tei-q">“Dots, Lines, Triangles, Cubes, Circles”</span> and
            finally <span class="tei tei-q">“Spheres”</span>—why or how?
            Because, says the Commentary, such is the first law of Nature,
            and because Nature geometrizes universally in all her
            manifestations. There is an inherent law—not only in the
            primordial, but also in the manifested matter of our phenomenal
            plane—by which Nature correlates her geometrical forms, and
            later, also, her compound elements, and in which also there is no
            place for accident or chance. It is a fundamental law in
            Occultism, that there is no rest or cessation of motion in
            Nature.<a href="#note_166" id="noteref_166" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>
            That which seems rest is only the change of one form into
            another, the change of substance going hand in hand with that of
            form—so at least we are taught in Occult physics, which thus seem
            to have anticipated the discovery of the <span class="tei tei-q">“conservation of matter”</span> by a considerable
            time. Says the ancient Commentary<a href="#note_167" id="noteref_167" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> to

            attracted to each other and form the Curds in the Ocean [of

            Dots, Triangles and Cubes, which ripen, and at the appointed time
            some of the lumps detach themselves and assume spheroidal form, a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>)
            The <span class="tei tei-q">“One Rejected”</span> is the Sun of
            our system. The exoteric version may be found in the oldest
            Sanskrit Scriptures. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>, Aditi, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Boundless”</span> or Infinite
            Space—translated by Prof. Max Müller, <span class="tei tei-q">“the visible infinite, visible by the naked eye (!!);
            the endless expanse beyond the earth, beyond the clouds, beyond
            the sky”</span>—is the equivalent of <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother-Space,”</span> coëval with <span class="tei tei-q">“Darkness.”</span> She is very properly called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of the Gods,”</span> Deva-Mâtri,
            as it is from her cosmic matrix that all the heavenly bodies of
            our system were born—sun and planets. Thus she is described,
            allegorically, in this wise: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eight sons were born from the body of Aditi;
            she approached the gods with seven, but cast away the eighth,
            Mârttânda</span></span>,”</span> our sun. The seven sons called
            the Adityas are, cosmically or astronomically, the seven planets;
            and the sun being excluded from their number shows plainly that
            the Hindûs may have known, and in fact knew, of a seventh planet,
            without calling it Uranus.<a href="#note_176" id="noteref_176" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a> But
            esoterically and theologically, so to say, the Adityas, in their
            primitive most ancient meanings, are the eight, and twelve great
            gods of the Hindû Pantheon. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Seven
            allow the mortals to see their dwellings, but show themselves
            only to the Arhats,”</span> says an old proverb; <span class="tei tei-q">“their dwellings”</span> standing here for the
            planets. The ancient Commentary gives the following allegory and
            explains it:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eight houses were
            built by Mother: eight houses for her eight Divine Sons; four
            large and four small ones. Eight brilliant Suns, according to
            their age and merits. Bal-i-lu [Mârttânda] was not satisfied,
            though his house was the largest. He began [to work] as the huge
            elephants do. He breathed [drew in] into his stomach the vital
            airs of his brothers. He sought to devour them. The larger four
            were far away; far, on the margin</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg127"></a><span style="font-style: italic">of their
            kingdom.</span><a href="#note_177" id="noteref_177" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">177</span></span></a>
<span style="font-style: italic">They were not robbed [affected],
            and laughed. Do your worst, Sir, you cannot reach us, they said.
            But the smaller wept. They complained to the Mother. She exiled
            Bal-i-lu to the centre of her kingdom, from whence he could not
            move. [Since then] he [only] watches and threatens. He pursues
            them, turning slowly round himself; they turning swiftly from
            him, and he following from afar the direction in which his
            brothers move on the path that encircles their
            houses.</span><a href="#note_178" id="noteref_178" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; font-style: italic; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>
<span style="font-style: italic">From that day he feeds on the
            sweat of the Mother's body. He fills himself with her breath and
            refuse. Therefore, she rejected him</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Rejected Son”</span> being our Sun,
            evidently, as shown above, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son-Suns”</span> refer not only to our planets but
            to the heavenly bodies in general. Sûrya, himself only a
            reflection of the Central Spiritual Sun, is the prototype of all
            those bodies that evolved after him. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>
            he is called Loka-Chakshuh, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Eye of
            the World”</span> (our planetary world), and he is one of the
            three chief deities. He is called indifferently the Son of Dyaus
            or of Aditi, because no distinction is made with reference to, or
            scope allowed for, the esoteric meaning. Thus he is depicted as
            drawn by seven horses, and by one horse with seven heads; the
            former referring to his seven planets, the latter to their one
            common origin from the One Cosmic Element. This <span class="tei tei-q">“One Element”</span> is called figuratively
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>
            teach that <span class="tei tei-q">“fire verily is all the
            deities.”</span><a href="#note_179" id="noteref_179" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The meaning of
            the allegory is plain, for we have both the Dzyan Commentary and
            Modern Science to explain it, though the two differ in more than
            one particular. The Occult Doctrine rejects the hypothesis born
            of the Nebular Theory, that the (seven) great planets have
            evolved from the Sun's central mass, of this our visible Sun, at
            any rate. The first condensation of cosmic matter of course took
            place about a central nucleus, its parent Sun; but our Sun, it is
            taught, merely detached itself earlier than all the others, as
            the rotating mass contracted, and is their elder, bigger
            <span class="tei tei-q">“brother”</span> therefore, not their
            <span class="tei tei-q">“father.”</span> The eight Adityas, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“gods,”</span> are all formed from the
            eternal substance (cometary matter<a href="#note_180" id="noteref_180" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a>—the
            Mother), or the <span class="tei tei-q">“world-stuff,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg128"></a> which is both the
            fifth and the sixth Cosmic Principle, the Upâdhi, or Basis, of
            the Universal Soul, just as in man, the Microcosm, Manas<a href="#note_181" id="noteref_181" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a> is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
            whole poem on the pregenetic battles fought by the growing
            planets before the final formation of Cosmos, thus accounting for
            the seemingly disturbed position of the systems of several
            planets; the plane of the satellites of some (of Neptune and
            Uranus, for instance, of which the ancients knew nothing, it is
            said) being tilted over, thus giving them an appearance of
            retrograde motion. These planets are called the Warriors, the
            Architects, and are accepted by the Roman Church as the leaders
            of the heavenly Hosts, thus showing the same traditions. Having
            evolved from Cosmic Space, the Sun, we are taught—before the
            final formation of the primaries and the annulation of the
            planetary nebulæ—drew into the depths of his mass all the cosmic
            vitality he could, threatening to engulf his weaker <span class="tei tei-q">“Brothers,”</span> before the law of attraction and
            repulsion was finally adjusted; after which, he began feeding on
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mother's refuse and sweat”</span>;
            in other words, on those portions of Æther (the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath of the Universal Soul”</span>), of the
            existence and constitution of which Science is as yet absolutely
            ignorant. As a theory of this kind has been propounded by Sir
            William Grove,<a href="#note_183" id="noteref_183" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">183</span></span></a> who
            theorizes that the systems <span class="tei tei-q">“are gradually
            changing by atmospheric additions or subtractions, or by
            accretions and diminutions arising from nebular
            substance,”</span> and again that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            sun may condense gaseous matter as it travels in space, and so
            heat may be produced”</span>—the archaic teaching seems
            scientific enough, even in this age.<a href="#note_184" id="noteref_184" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a> Mr.
            W. Mattieu Williams suggested that the diffused matter or Ether,
            which is the recipient of the heat radiations of the Universe, is
            thereby drawn into the depths of the solar mass; expelling thence
            the previously condensed and thermally exhausted Ether, it
            becomes compressed and gives up its heat, to be in turn itself
            driven out in a rarefied and cooled state, to absorb a fresh
            supply of heat, which he supposes to be in this way taken up by

            of the eighteenth century, the name of the fourth planet
            mentioned in the allegory must remain to us, so far, a
            mystery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath”</span> of all the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven”</span> is said to be Bhâskara, the
            Light-Maker, because they (the planets) were all comets and suns
            in their origin. They evolve into manvantaric life from Primeval
            Chaos (now the noumenon of irresolvable nebulæ), by aggregation
            and accumulation of the primary differentiations of eternal
            Matter, according to the beautiful expression in the Commentary,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thus the Sons of Light clothed themselves in
            the fabric of Darkness</span></span>.”</span> They are called
            allegorically the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly
            Snails,”</span> on account of their (to us) formless
            Intelligences inhabiting unseen their starry and planetary homes,
            and so to speak, carrying them, as the snails do, along with
            themselves in their revolution. The doctrine of a common origin
            for all the heavenly bodies and planets was, as we see,
            inculcated by the archaic astronomers, before Kepler, Newton,
            Leibnitz, Kant, Herschel and Laplace. Heat (the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath”</span>), Attraction and Repulsion—the three
            great factors of Motion—are the conditions under which all the
            members of this primitive family are born, develop, and die; to
            be reborn after a Night of Brahmâ, during which eternal Matter
            relapses periodically into its primary undifferentiated state.
            The most attenuated gases can give no idea of its nature to the
            modern Physicist. Centres of Forces at first, the invisible
            Sparks, or primordial Atoms, differentiate into Molecules, and
            become Suns—passing gradually into objectivity—gaseous, radiant,
            cosmic, the one <span class="tei tei-q">“Whirlwind”</span> (or
            Motion) finally giving the impulse to the form, and the initial
            motion, regulated and sustained by the never-resting <span class="tei tei-q">“Breaths”</span>—the Dhyân Chohans.</p>

            Mystically, these Divine Beings are connected with Karma, the Law
            of Retribution, for they are the Recorders, or Annalists, who
            impress on the (to us) invisible tablets of the Astral Light,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the great picture-gallery of

            thought, of man; of all that was, is, or ever will be, in the

            meet with the same records in the world of gross matter. As Dr.
            Draper says:</p>

            altogether shut out, and our retirement can never be profaned,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The forty

            belong to the same class of deities as the Lipika, and might
            stand as parallels, were not the Egyptian gods so little
            understood in their esoteric meaning. The Hindû Chitragupta who
            reads out the account of every Soul's life from his register,
            called <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg

            the Defunct, which becomes an open book before either Yama,
            Minos, Osiris, or Karma—are all so many copies of, and variants
            from, the Lipika and their Astral Records. Nevertheless, the
            Lipika are not deities connected with Death, but with Life
            Eternal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Connected as
            the Lipika are with the destiny of every man, and the birth of
            every child, whose life is already traced in the Astral Light—not
            fatalistically, but only because the Future, like the Past, is
            ever alive in the Present—they may also be said to exercise an
            influence on the Science of Horoscopy. We must admit the truth of
            the latter whether we will or not. For, as observed by one of the
            modern professors of Astrology:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is,
            perhaps, the most difficult of all the Stanzas to explain. Its
            language is comprehensible only to him who is thoroughly versed
            in Eastern allegory, and its purposely obscure phraseology. The
            question will surely be asked: Do the Occultists believe in all
            these <span class="tei tei-q">“Builders,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Lipika,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of
            Light,”</span> as Entities, or are they merely imagery? To this
            the answer is given as plainly: After due allowance for the
            imagery of personified Powers, we must admit the existence of
            these Entities, if we would not reject the existence of Spiritual
            Humanity within physical mankind. For the hosts of these Sons of
            Light, the Mind-born Sons of the first manifested Ray of the
            Unknown All, are the very root of Spiritual Man. Unless we want
            to believe the unphilosophical dogma of a specially created soul
            for every human birth—a fresh supply of these pouring in daily,
            since <span class="tei tei-q">“Adam”</span>—we have to admit the
            Occult teachings. This will be explained in its place. Let us
            see, now, what may be the meaning of this Occult
            Stanza.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Doctrine
            teaches that, in order to become a divine, fully conscious
            God—aye, even the highest—the Spiritual Primeval Intelligences
            must pass through the human stage. And when we say human, this
            does not apply merely to our terrestrial humanity, but to the
            mortals that inhabit any world, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            to those Intelligences that have reached the appropriate
            equilibrium between matter and spirit, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em>
            have now, ever since the middle point of the Fourth Root Race of
            the Fourth Round was passed. Each Entity must have won for itself
            the right of becoming divine, through self-experience. Hegel, the
            great German thinker, must have known or sensed intuitionally
            this truth, when he said, that the Unconscious evolved the
            Universe only <span class="tei tei-q">“in the hope of attaining
            clear self-consciousness,”</span> in other words, of becoming
            Man; for this is also the secret meaning of the oft recurring
            Purânic phrase, of Brahmâ being constantly <span class="tei tei-q">“moved by the desire to create.”</span> This explains
            also the hidden Kabalistic meaning of the saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Breath becomes a stone; the stone, a plant; the
            plant, an animal; the animal, a man; the man, a spirit; and the
            spirit, a god.”</span> The Mind-born Sons, the Rishis, the
            Builders, etc., were all Men—of whatever forms and shapes—in
            other worlds and in preceding Manvantaras.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This subject
            being so very mystical, it is most difficult to explain it in all
            its details and bearings; for the whole mystery of evolutionary
            creation is contained therein. A sentence or two in the Shloka
            vividly recalls to mind similar sentences in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> and the phraseology of
            the King Psalmist.<a href="#note_191" id="noteref_191" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>
            Both, when speaking of God, show him making the wind his
            messenger and his <span class="tei tei-q">“ministers a flaming
            fire.”</span> But in the Esoteric Doctrine it is used
            figuratively. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery
            Whirl-wind”</span> is the incandescent cosmic dust which only
            follows magnetically, as the iron filings follow the magnet, the
            directing thought of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Creative
            Forces.”</span> Yet, this cosmic dust is something more; for
            every atom in the Universe has the potentiality of
            self-consciousness in it, and is, like the Monads of Leibnitz, a
            Universe in itself, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for</span></em> itself. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It is an atom and
            an angel</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
            connection it should be noted that one of the luminaries of the
            modern Evolutionist School, Mr. A. R. Wallace, when discussing
            the inadequacy of <span class="tei tei-q">“natural
            selection”</span> as the sole factor in the development of
            physical man, practically concedes the whole point here
            discussed. He holds that the evolution of man was directed and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg133"></a> furthered by
            superior Intelligences, whose agency is a necessary factor in the
            scheme of Nature. But once the operation of these Intelligences
            is admitted in one place, it is only a logical deduction to
            extend it still further. No hard and fast line can be drawn.</p>

            as well to say at once that, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according to the
            Orientalists</span></em>, there are five Dhyânis who are the
            Celestial Buddhas, of whom the Human Buddhas are the
            manifestations in the world of form and matter. Esoterically,
            however, the Dhyâni-Buddhas are seven, of whom five only have
            hitherto manifested,<a href="#note_197" id="noteref_197" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> and
            two are to come in the Sixth and Seventh Root-Races. They are, so
            to speak, the eternal prototypes of the Buddhas who appear on
            this earth, each of whom has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg134"></a> his particular divine prototype. So, for
            instance, Amitâbha is the Dhyâni-Buddha of Gautama Shâkyamuni,
            manifesting through him whenever this great Soul incarnates on
            earth as He did in Tzonkha-pa.<a href="#note_198" id="noteref_198" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> As
            the synthesis of the seven Dhyâni-Buddhas, Avalokiteshvara was
            the first Buddha (the Logos), and Amitâbha is the inner
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> of Gautama, who, in China,
            is called Amida (Buddha). They are, as Prof. Rhys Davids
            correctly states, <span class="tei tei-q">“the glorious
            counterparts in the mystic world, free from the debasing
            conditions of this material life,”</span> of every earthly mortal
            Buddha—the liberated Mânushi-Buddhas appointed to govern the
            Earth in this Round. They are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Buddhas of Contemplation,”</span> and are all
            Anupâdaka (parentless), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, self-born of the divine
            essence. The exoteric teaching—which says that every
            Dhyâni-Buddha has the faculty of creating from himself an equally
            celestial son, a Dhyâni-Bodhisattva, who, after the decease of
            the Mânushi-Buddha, has to carry out the work of the latter—rests
            on the fact that, owing to the highest Initiation performed by
            one overshadowed by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of
            Buddha”</span>—who is credited by the Orientalists with having
            created the five Dhyâni-Buddhas!—a candidate becomes virtually a
            Bodhisattva, created such by the High Initiator.</p>

            Fohat, being one of the most, if not the most important character
            in Esoteric cosmogony, should be minutely described. As in the
            oldest Grecian cosmogony, which differed widely from the later
            mythology, Eros is the third person in the primeval trinity,
            Chaos, Gæa, Eros—answering to the Kabalistic Trinity, Ain Suph,
            the Boundless All (for Chaos is Space, from χαίνω, to open wide,
            to be void), Shekinah and the Ancient of Days, or the Holy
            Ghost—so Fohat is one thing in the yet Unmanifested Universe, and
            another in the phenomenal and Cosmic World. In the latter, he is
            that occult, electric, vital power, which, under the Will of the
            Creative Logos, unites and brings together all forms, giving them
            the first impulse, which in time becomes law. But in the
            Unmanifested Universe, Fohat is no more this, than Eros is the
            later brilliant winged Cupid, or Love. Fohat has naught to do
            with Cosmos yet, since Cosmos is not born, and the Gods still
            sleep in the bosom of <span class="tei tei-q">“Father-Mother.”</span> He is an abstract
            philosophical idea. He produces nothing yet by himself; he is
            simply that potential creative Power, in virtue of whose action
            the Noumenon of all future phenomena <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg135"></a> divides, so to speak, but to reunite in a
            mystic supersensuous act, and emit the creative Ray. When the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Son”</span> breaks forth, then
            Fohat becomes the propelling force, the active Power which causes
            the One to become Two and Three—on the cosmic plane of
            manifestation. The triple One differentiates into the Many, and
            then Fohat is transformed into that force which brings together
            the elemental atoms, and makes them aggregate and combine. We
            find an echo of this primeval teaching in early Greek mythology.
            Erebus and Nux are born out of Chaos, and, under the action of
            Eros, give birth in their turn to Æther and Hemera, the light of
            the superior and the light of the inferior, or terrestrial,
            regions. Darkness generates light. Compare in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> Brahmâ's Will or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Desire”</span> to create; and in the
            Phœnician cosmogony of Sanchuniathon the doctrine that Desire,
            πόθος, is the principle of creation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fohat is
            closely related to the <span class="tei tei-q">“One Life.”</span>
            From the Unknown One, the Infinite Totality, the Manifested One,
            or the periodical, Manvantaric Deity, emanates; and this is the
            Universal Mind, which, separated from its Fountain-Source, is the
            Demiurge or the Creative Logos of the Western Kabalists, and the
            Four-faced Brahmâ of the Hindû religion. In its totality, viewed,
            in the Esoteric doctrine, from the standpoint of manifested
            Divine Thought, it represents the Hosts of the higher Creative
            Dhyân Chohans. Simultaneously with the evolution of the Universal
            Mind, the Concealed Wisdom of Adi-Buddha—the One Supreme and
            Eternal—manifests itself as Avalokiteshvara (or Manifested
            Îshvara), which is the Osiris of the Egyptians, the Ahura-Mazda
            of the Zoroastrians, the Heavenly Man of the Hermetic
            philosophers, the Logos of the Platonists, and the Âtman of the
            Vedântins.<a href="#note_199" id="noteref_199" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> By
            the action of the Manifested Wisdom, or Mahat—represented by

            Reflection of the Universal Mind, which is Cosmic Ideation and
            the Intellectual Force accompanying such Ideation, becomes
            objectively the Fohat of the Buddhist esoteric philosopher.
            Fohat, running along the seven principles of Âkâsha, acts upon
            manifested Substance, or the One Element, as declared above, and,
            by differentiating it into various centres of energy, sets in
            motion the law of Cosmic Evolution, which, in obedience to the
            Ideation of the Universal Mind, brings into existence all the
            various states of being in the manifested Solar
            System.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Solar
            System, brought into existence by these agencies, consists of
            Seven Principles, like everything else within these centres. Such
            is the teaching of the Trans-Himâlayan Esotericism. Every
            philosophy, however, has its own way of dividing these
            principles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fohat, then,
            is the personified electric vital power, the transcendental
            binding unity of all cosmic energies, on the unseen as on the
            manifested planes, the action of which resembles—on an immense
            scale—that of a living Force created by Will, in those phenomena
            where the seemingly subjective acts on the seemingly objective,
            and propels it to action. Fohat is not only the living Symbol and
            Container of that Force, but is looked upon by the Occultists as
            an Entity; the forces it acts upon being cosmic, human and
            terrestrial, and exercising their influence on all these planes
            respectively. On the earthly plane, its influence is felt in the
            magnetic and active force generated by the strong desire of the
            magnetizer. On the cosmic, it is present in the constructive
            power that, in the formation of things—from the planetary system
            down to the glow-worm and simple daisy—carries out the plan in
            the mind of Nature, or in the Divine Thought, with regard to the
            development and growth of a particular thing. It is,
            metaphysically, the objectivized Thought of the Gods, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Word made flesh”</span> on a lower
            scale, and the messenger of cosmic and human Ideation; the active
            force in Universal Life. In its secondary aspect, Fohat is the
            Solar Energy, the electric vital fluid, and the preserving Fourth
            Principle, the Animal Soul of Nature, so to say,
            or—Electricity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1882, the
            President of the Theosophical Society, Col. Olcott, was taken to
            task for asserting in one of his lectures that Electricity is
            matter. Such, nevertheless, is the teaching of the Occult
            Doctrine. <span class="tei tei-q">“Force,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Energy,”</span> may be better names for it, so long
            as European Science knows so little about its true nature; yet
            matter it is, as much as Ether is matter, since it is as atomic,
            though indeed several removes from Ether. It seems ridiculous to
            argue that because a thing is imponderable to Science, therefore
            it cannot be called matter. Electricity is <span class="tei tei-q">“immaterial,”</span> in the sense that its molecules
            are not subject to perception and experiment; yet it may be—and
            Occultism says it is—atomic; therefore it is matter. But even
            supposing it were unscientific to speak of it in such terms, once
            Electricity is called in Science a source of Energy, Energy
            simply, and a Force—where is that Force or that Energy which can
            be thought of without thinking of matter? Maxwell, a
            mathematician and one of the greatest authorities <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg137"></a> upon Electricity and its
            phenomena, said, years ago, that Electricity was matter, not
            motion merely. <span class="tei tei-q">“If we accept the
            hypothesis that the elementary substances are composed of atoms,
            we cannot avoid concluding that electricity also, positive as
            well as negative, is divided into definite elementary portions,
            which behave like atoms of electricity.”</span><a href="#note_200" id="noteref_200" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> We
            will go further than this, and assert that Electricity is not
            only Substance, but that it is an emanation from an Entity, which
            is neither God nor Devil, but one of the numberless Entities that
            rule and guide our world, according to the eternal Law of
            Karma.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return to
            Fohat, it is connected with Vishnu and Sûrya in the early
            character of the former God; for Vishnu is not a high God in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig
            Veda</span></span>. The name Vishnu is from the root <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vish</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“to pervade,”</span> and Fohat is called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Pervader”</span> and the Manufacturer,
            because he shapes the atoms from crude material.<a href="#note_201" id="noteref_201" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> In
            the sacred texts of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>, Vishnu is also
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a manifestation of the Solar Energy, and
            is described as striding through the seven regions of the
            Universe in three steps,”</span> the Vedic God having little in
            common with the Vishnu of later times. Therefore the two are
            identical in this particular feature, and one is the copy of the
            other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Three and
            Seven <span class="tei tei-q">“Strides”</span> refer to the seven
            spheres inhabited by man, in the Esoteric Doctrine, as well as to
            the seven regions of the Earth. Notwithstanding the frequent
            objections made by would-be Orientalists, the Seven Worlds, or
            Spheres, of our Planetary Chain are distinctly referred to in the
            exoteric Hindû scriptures. But how strangely all these numbers
            are connected with like numbers in other cosmogonies and with
            their symbols, can be seen from the comparisons and parallelisms
            made by students of old religions. The <span class="tei tei-q">“three strides of Vishnu,”</span> through the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“seven regions of the Universe,”</span>
            of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>, have been variously
            explained by commentators as meaning fire, lightning and the sun,
            cosmically, and as having been taken in the earth, the
            atmosphere, and the sky; more philosophically—and in the
            astronomical sense, very correctly—they are explained by
            Aurnavâbha as being the various positions of the sun, rising,
            noon, and setting. Esoteric Philosophy alone explains it clearly,
            though the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span> has laid it down very
            philosophically and comprehensively. It is plainly demonstrated
            therein that in the beginning the Elohim (Alhim) were called
            Achad, <span class="tei tei-q">“One,”</span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Deity, One in Many,”</span> a very simple idea
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg138"></a> in a pantheistic
            conception—pantheistic in its philosophical sense, of course.
            Then came the change, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah is
            Elohim,”</span> thus unifying the multiplicity and taking the
            first step towards Monotheism. Now to the query, <span class="tei tei-q">“How is Jehovah Elohim?”</span> the answer is,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“By Three Steps”</span> from below. The
            meaning is plain. The Steps are symbols, and emblematic, mutually
            and correlatively, of Spirit, Soul and Body (Man); of the Circle,
            transformed into Spirit, the Soul of the World and its Body (or
            Earth). Stepping out of the Circle of Infinity, that no man
            comprehendeth, Ain Suph—the Kabalistic synonym for Parabrahman,
            for the Zeroâna Akerne, of the Mazdeans, or for any other
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable”</span>—becomes <span class="tei tei-q">“One”</span> (the Achad, the Eka, the Ahu); then he
            (or it) is transformed by evolution into the <span class="tei tei-q">“One in Many,”</span> the Dhyâni-Buddhas or the
            Elohim, or again the Amshaspends, his third Step being taken into
            the generation of the flesh, or Man. And from Man, or Jah-Hovah,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“male-female,”</span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner</span></em>

            the invisible, while the Sun was the One Circle from which
            proceeded the cosmic orbs, of which he was considered the leader.
            Zeroâna, is the Chakra, or Circle, of Vishnu, the mysterious
            emblem which is, according to the definition of a Mystic,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a curve of such a nature that as to any,
            the least possible, part thereof, if the curve be protracted
            either way, it will proceed and finally reënter upon itself, and
            form one and the same curve—or that which we call the
            circle.”</span> No better definition could thus be given of the
            natural symbol and the evident nature of Deity, which having its
            circumference everywhere (the boundless) has, therefore, its
            central point also everywhere; in other words, is in every point
            of the Universe. The invisible Deity is thus also the Dhyân
            Chohans, or the Rishis, the primitive seven, and the nine,
            without, and ten, including, their synthetical unit, from which
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">It</span></span> steps into Man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning to
            Commentary 4 of Stanza IV, the reader now will understand why,
            while the Trans-Himâlayan Chakra has inscribed within it
            [triangle] [square] [5-point star with middle dot]—triangle,
            first line, square, second line, and a pentacle with a point in
            the centre, either thus [5-point star with middle dot] or some
            other variation—the Kabalistic Circle of the Elohim reveals, when
            the letters of the word אלהים (Alhim or Elohim) are read
            numerically, the famous numerals 13514, or anagrammatically
            31415—the astronomical π (pi), or the hidden meaning of the
            Dhyâni-Buddhas, of the Gebers, the Giburim, the Kabeiri, and the
            Elohim, all signifying <span class="tei tei-q">“Great
            Men,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Titans,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Men,”</span> and, on earth,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Seven was
            a Sacred Number with every nation; but none applied it to more
            physiologically materialistic uses than the Hebrews. With them 7
            was preëminently the generative number, and 9 the male causative
            one, forming as shown by the Kabalists the otz, עצ (90, 70), or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Tree of the Garden of Eden,”</span>
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“double hermaphrodite rod”</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg140"></a> of the Fourth
            Race. This was the symbol of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy of
            Holies,”</span> the 3 and the 4 of sexual separation. Nearly
            every one of the 22 Hebrew letters are merely phallic symbols. Of
            the two letters—as shown above—one, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ayin</span></span>, is a negative female
            letter, symbolically an eye; the the other a male letter,
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tzâ</span></span>, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fish</span></em>-hook or dart. Whereas with
            the Hindûs and Âryans generally, the significance was manifold,
            and related almost entirely to purely metaphysical and
            astronomical truths. Their Rishis and Gods, their Demons and
            Heroes, have historical and ethical meanings.</p>

              adventitious sides the same borrowed plumage that the Greeks
              (the lying Greeks) had, and that Masonry has: which, in the
              rough monosyllabic (and apparent) poverty of the Hebrew, shows
              the latter to have come down from a far more remote antiquity
              than any of these, and to have been the source [! ?], or nearer
              the old original source than any of them.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
            entirely erroneous. Our learned brother and correspondent judges
            the Hindû religious systems apparently by their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shâstras</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, probably the latter,
            and in their modern translations moreover, which disfigure them
            out of all recognition. It is to their philosophical systems that
            we have to turn, to their esoteric teaching, if we would make a
            point of comparison. No doubt the symbology of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>, and even of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New
            Testament</span></span>, comes from the same source. But surely
            the Pyramid of Cheops, whose measurements are all found, by
            Professor Piazzi Smyth, repeated in Solomon's alleged and
            mythical Temple, is not of a later date than the Mosaic books?
            Hence, if there is any such great identity as is claimed, it must
            be due to servile copying on the part of the Jews, not on that of
            the Egyptians. The glyphs of the Jews—and even their language,
            the Hebrew—are not original. They are borrowed from the
            Egyptians, from whom Moses got his Wisdom; from the Coptic, the
            probable kinsman, if not parent, of the old Phœnician and from
            the Hyksos, their (alleged) ancestors, as Josephus shows.<a href="#note_204" id="noteref_204" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">204</span></span></a>
            Aye; but who are the Hyksos shepherds? And who the Egyptians?
            History knows nothing of the question, and speculates and
            theorizes out of the depths of the respective consciousnesses
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg141"></a> of her

<span class="tei tei-q">“Khamism, or old Coptic, is from Western
            Asia, and contains some germ of the Semitic, thus bearing witness
            to the primitive cognate unity of the Âryan and Semitic
            races,”</span> says Bunsen, who places the great events in Egypt
            9,000 years <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The fact is that in
            archaic Esotericism and Âryan thought we find a grand philosophy,
            whereas in the Hebrew records we find only the most surprising
            ingenuity in inventing apotheoses for phallic worship and sexual
            theogony.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the
            Âryans never made their religion rest solely on physiological
            symbols, as the old Hebrews have done, may be seen in the
            exoteric Hindû Scriptures. That these accounts, also, are blinds
            is shown by their contradicting each other, a different
            explanation being found in almost every <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purâna</span></span> and epic poem. Read
            esoterically, however, they will all yield the same meaning. Thus
            one account enumerates seven worlds, exclusive of the nether
            worlds, also seven in number; these fourteen upper and nether
            worlds have nothing to do with the classification of the
            Septenary Chain and belong to the purely ethereal, invisible
            worlds. These will be noticed elsewhere. Suffice it for the
            present to show that they are purposely referred to as though
            they belonged to the Chain. <span class="tei tei-q">“Another
            enumeration calls the seven worlds earth, sky, heaven, middle
            region, place of birth, mansion of the blest, and abode of truth;
            placing the Sons of Brahmâ in the sixth division, and stating the
            fifth, or Jana-loka, to be that where animals destroyed in the
            general conflagration are born again.”</span><a href="#note_206" id="noteref_206" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">206</span></span></a>
            Some real Esoteric teaching is given in the subsequent chapters
            on Symbolism. He who is prepared for it will understand the

            spheroidal and ends by being transformed into globes or spheres.
            It is one of the fundamental dogmas of Esoteric cosmogony, that
            during the Kalpas (or Æons) of Life, Motion, which, during the
            periods of Rest, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pulsates and
            thrills through every slumbering
            atom</span></span>”</span>—assumes an evergrowing tendency, from
            the first awakening of Kosmos to a new <span class="tei tei-q">“Day,”</span> to circular movement. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Deity becomes a Whirlwind.”</span> It may be
            asked, as the writer has not failed to ask: Who is there to
            ascertain the difference in that Motion, since all Nature is
            reduced to its primal essence, and there can be no one—not even
            one of the Dhyâni-Chohans, who are all in Nirvâna—to see it? The
            answer to this is: Everything in Nature has to be judged by
            analogy. Though the highest Deities (Archangels or
            Dhyâni-Buddhas) are unable to penetrate the mysteries which lie
            too far beyond our Planetary System and the visible Cosmos, yet
            there were great seers and prophets in olden times who were
            enabled to perceive the mystery of Breath and Motion
            retrospectively, when the systems of Worlds were at rest and
            plunged in their periodic sleep.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Wheels are
            also called Rotæ—the moving wheels of the celestial orbs
            participating in the world's creation—when the meaning refers to
            the animating principle of the stars and planets; for, in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, they are represented
            by the Auphanim, the Angels of the Spheres and Stars, of which

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This law of
            vortical movement in primordial matter is one of the oldest
            conceptions of Greek philosophy, whose first historical sages
            were nearly all Initiates of the Mysteries. The Greeks had it
            from the Egyptians, and the latter from the Chaldeans, who had
            been the pupils of Brâhmans of the Esoteric school. Leucippus,
            and Democritus of Abdera—the pupil of the Magi—taught that this
            gyratory movement of the atoms and spheres existed from
            eternity.<a href="#note_210" id="noteref_210" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a>
            Hicetas, Heraclides, Ecphantus, Pythagoras, and all his pupils,
            taught the rotation of the earth; and Âryabhata of India,

            as the Astronomers do now; while the theory of Elemental Vortices
            was known to Anaxagoras, and maintained by him 500 years
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, or nearly 2,000
            before it was taken up by Galileo, Descartes, Swedenborg, and
            finally, with slight modifications, by Sir W. Thomson.<a href="#note_211" id="noteref_211" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> All
            such knowledge, if justice be only done, is an echo of the
            archaic doctrine, an attempt to explain which is now being made.
            How men of the last few centuries have come to the same ideas and
            conclusions that were taught as axiomatic truths in the secrecy
            of the Adyta, dozens of millenniums ago, is a question that is
            treated separately. Some were led to it by the natural progress
            in Physical Science and by independent observation; others—such
            as Copernicus, Swedenborg, and a few more—their great learning
            notwithstanding, owed their knowledge far more to intuitive than
            to acquired ideas, developed in the usual way by a course of
            study. That Swedenborg, who could not possibly have known
            anything of the esoteric ideas of Buddhism, independently came
            near the Occult teaching in his general conceptions, is shown by
            his essay on the Vortical Theory. In Clissold's translation of
            it, quoted by Prof. Winchell,<a href="#note_212" id="noteref_212" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> we
            find the following <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">résumé</span></span>:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The first cause is the infinite or unlimited.
            This gives existence to the first finite or limited. [The Logos
            in its manifestation and the Universe.] That which produces a

              The limit produced is a point, the essence of which is motion;
              but being without parts, this essence is not actual motion, but
              only a conatus to it. [In our doctrine it is not a</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">conatus,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">but a change from Eternal Vibration, in the
              unmanifested, to Vortical Motion, in the phenomenal or
              manifested World.] From this first proceed extension, space,
              figure, and succession, or time. As in geometry a point
              generates a line, a line a surface, and a surface a solid, so
              here the conatus of the point tends towards lines, surfaces and
              solids. In other words, the Universe is contained</span>

            This tracing of <span class="tei tei-q">“spiral lines”</span>
            refers to the evolution of Man's as well as of Nature's
            Principles; an evolution which takes place gradually, as does
            everything else in Nature. The Sixth Principle in Man (Buddhi,
            the Divine Soul), though a mere breath, in our conceptions, is
            still something material when compared with Divine Spirit (Âtmâ),
            of which it is the carrier or vehicle. Fohat, in his capacity of
            Divine Love (Eros), the electric power of affinity and sympathy,
            is shown, allegorically, trying to bring the pure Spirit, the Ray
            inseparable from the One Absolute, into union with the Soul, the
            two constituting in Man the Monad, and in Nature the first link
            between the ever-unconditioned and the manifested. <span class="tei tei-q">“The First is now the Second [World]”</span>—of the
            Lipikas—has reference to the same.</p>

            The <span class="tei tei-q">“Army”</span> at each angle is the

            of a Manvantara. They are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystic
            Watchers”</span> of the Christian Kabalists and Alchemists, and
            relate, symbolically as well as cosmogonically, to the numerical
            system of the Universe. The numbers with which these Celestial
            Beings are connected, are extremely difficult to explain, as each
            number refers to several groups of distinct ideas, according to
            the particular group of <span class="tei tei-q">“Angels”</span>
            which it is intended to represent. Herein lies the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nodus</span></span> in the study of
            symbology, with which so many scholars, unable to untie it, have
            preferred dealing as Alexander dealt with the Gordian knot; hence
            erroneous conceptions and teachings, as a direct result.</p>

            The <span class="tei tei-q">“First is the Second,”</span> because
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“First”</span> cannot really be
            numbered or regarded as such, for the First is the realm of
            noumena in its primary manifestation, the threshold to the World
            of Truth, or Sat, through which the direct energy that radiates
            from the One Reality—the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg145"></a> Nameless Deity—reaches us. Here again, the
            untranslateable term Sat (Be-ness) is likely to lead to an
            erroneous conception, since that which is manifested cannot be
            Sat, but is something phenomenal, not everlasting, nor, in truth,
            even sempiternal. It is coëval and coëxistent with the One Life,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Secondless,”</span> but as a
            manifestation it is still a Mâyâ—like the rest. This <span class="tei tei-q">“World of Truth,”</span> in the words of the

            Monads—the Âtmâ, or the irradiating Spirit of every creature of
            the human family. First, this Septenary Light; then the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
            deep philosophy underlying the earliest worship in the world, the
            worship of the Sun and of Fire. Of all the Elements known to
            Physical Science, Fire is that which has ever eluded definite
            analysis. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
            146]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg146"></a>
            It is confidently asserted that air is a mixture containing the
            gases oxygen and nitrogen. We view the Universe and the Earth as
            matter composed of definite chemical molecules. We speak of the
            primitive ten earths, endowing each with a Greek or Latin name.
            We say that water is, chemically, a compound of oxygen and
            hydrogen. But what is Fire? It is the effect of combustion, we
            are gravely answered. It is heat and light and motion, and a
            correlation of physical and chemical forces in general. And this
            scientific definition is philosophically supplemented by a
            theological one in Webster's Dictionary, which explains fire as
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the instrument of punishment, or the
            punishment of the impenitent in another state”</span>—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“state,”</span> by the bye, being
            supposed to be spiritual; but, alas! the presence of fire would
            seem to be a convincing proof of its material nature. Yet,
            speaking of the illusion of regarding phenomena as simple,
            because they are familiar, Professor Bain says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Very familiar facts seem to stand in no need of
            explanation themselves and to be the means of explaining whatever
            can be assimilated to them. Thus, the boiling and evaporation of
            a liquid is supposed to be a very simple phenomenon requiring no
            explanation, and a satisfactory explanation of rarer phenomena.
            That water should dry up is, to the uninstructed mind, a thing
            wholly intelligible: whereas to the man acquainted with physical
            science the liquid state is anomalous and inexplicable. The
            lighting of a fire by a flame is a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What says the
            Esoteric teaching with regard to Fire? <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fire is the most perfect and unadulterated
            reflection, in Heaven as on Earth, of the One Flame. It is Life
            and Death, the origin and the end of every material thing. It is
            divine Substance.</span></span>”</span> Thus, not only the
            Fire-Worshipper, the Parsi, but even the wandering savage tribes
            of America, which proclaim themselves <span class="tei tei-q">“born of fire,”</span> show more science in their
            creeds and truth in their superstitions, than all the
            speculations of modern physics and learning. The Christian who
            says, <span class="tei tei-q">“God is a living Fire,”</span> and
            speaks of the Pentecostal <span class="tei tei-q">“Tongues of
            Fire”</span> and of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Burning
            Bush”</span> of Moses, is as much a fire-worshipper as any other
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heathen.”</span> Among the Mystics and
            Kabalists, the Rosicrucians were those who defined Fire in the
            most correct way. Procure a sixpenny lamp, keep it only supplied
            with oil, and you will be able to light at its flame the lamps,
            candles, and fires of the whole globe without diminishing that
            flame. If the Deity, the radical One, is an eternal and infinite
            Substance never consumed (<span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord thy
            God is a consuming fire”</span>), <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg147"></a> then it does not seem reasonable that the
            Occult teaching should be held as unphilosophical when it says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Thus were formed the Arûpa and Rûpa

            are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Four Mahârâjahs,”</span> or
            great Kings, of the Dhyân Chohans, the Devas, who preside each
            over one of the four cardinal points. They are the Regents, or
            Angels, who rule over the Cosmical Forces of North, South, East
            and West, Forces having each a distinct Occult property. These
            Beings are also connected with Karma, as the latter needs
            physical and material agents to carry out its decrees, such as
            the four kinds of winds, for instance, professedly admitted by
            Science to have their respective evil and beneficent influences
            upon the health of mankind and every living thing. There is
            Occult philosophy in the Roman Catholic doctrine which traces the
            various public calamities, such as epidemics of disease,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg148"></a> and wars, and so
            on, to the invisible <span class="tei tei-q">“Messengers”</span>
            from North and West. <span class="tei tei-q">“The glory of God
            comes from the way of the East,”</span> says Ezekiel; while
            Jeremiah, Isaiah, and the Psalmist assure their readers that all
            the evil under the Sun comes from the North and the West—which,
            when applied to the Jewish nation, sounds like an undeniable
            prophecy. And this accounts also for St. Ambrose<a href="#note_223" id="noteref_223" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a>
            declaring that it is precisely for this reason that <span class="tei tei-q">“we curse the North Wind, and that during the
            ceremony of baptism we begin by turning towards the West
            [Sidereal], to renounce the better him who inhabits it; after
            which we turn to the East.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Belief in the
            Four Mahârâjahs—the Regents of the four cardinal points—was

            understood, each such species having indeed its particular angel
            to watch it. He is at one in this with all the philosophers ...
            For us these angels are spirits separated from the objects....

            and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">worship</span></em> the Elements and the
            (imaginary) cardinal points, but the <span class="tei tei-q">“gods”</span> that respectively rule over them. For
            the Church, there are two kinds of Sidereal Beings, Angels and
            Devils. For the Kabalist and Occultist, there is but one class,
            and neither Occultist nor Kabalist makes any difference between
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Rectors of Light”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Rectores Tenebrarum,”</span> or
            Cosmocratores, whom the Roman Church imagines and discovers in
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Rectors of Light,”</span> as soon as
            any one of them is called by another name than the one she
            addresses him by. It is not the Rector, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg149"></a> Mahârâjah, who punishes or
            rewards, with or without <span class="tei tei-q">“God's”</span>
            permission or order, but man himself—his deeds, or Karma,
            attracting individually and collectively (as in the case of whole
            nations, sometimes) every kind of evil and calamity. We produce
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Causes</span></em>, and these awaken the
            corresponding powers in the Sidereal World, which are
            magnetically and irresistibly attracted to—and reäct upon—those
            who produce such causes; whether such persons are practically the
            evil-doers, or simply <span class="tei tei-q">“thinkers”</span>
            who brood mischief. For thought is matter, we are taught by
            Modern Science; and <span class="tei tei-q">“every particle of
            the existing matter must be a register of all that has
            happened,”</span> as Messrs. Jevons and Babbage in their
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Principles of Science</span></span> tell the
            profane. Modern Science is every day drawn more into the
            maëlstrom of Occultism; unconsciously, no doubt, still very
            sensibly.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Thought is matter”</span>: not of course, however,
            in the sense of the German Materialist Moleschott, who assures us
            that <span class="tei tei-q">“thought is the movement of
            matter”</span>—a statement of almost unparalleled absurdity.
            Mental states and bodily states are utterly contrasted as such.
            But that does not affect the position that every thought, in
            addition to its physical accompaniment (brain-change), exhibits
            an objective—though to us supersensuously objective—aspect on the
            astral plane.<a href="#note_225" id="noteref_225" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">225</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two main
            theories of Science as to the relations between Mind and Matter
            are Monism and Materialism. These two cover the whole ground of
            negative psychology with the exception of the quasi-occult views
            of the German Pantheistic schools.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The views of
            our present-day scientific thinkers as to the relations between
            mind and matter may be reduced to the following two hypotheses.
            These show that both views equally exclude the possibility of an
            independent soul, distinct from the physical brain through which
            it functions. They are:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.)
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Materialism</span></span>, the theory which
            regards mental phenomena as the product of molecular change in
            the brain; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, as the outcome of a
            transformation of motion into feeling (!). The cruder school once
            went so far as to identify mind with a <span class="tei tei-q">“peculiar mode of motion”</span> (!!), but this view
            is now happily regarded as absurd by most of the men of Science
            themselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.)
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monism</span></span>, or the Single
            Substance doctrine, is the more subtle form of negative
            psychology, which one of its advocates, Professor Bain, ably
            terms <span class="tei tei-q">“guarded materialism.”</span> This
            doctrine, which commands a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg150"></a> very wide assent, counting among its
            upholders such men as Lewes, Spencer, Ferrier, and others, while
            positing thought and mental phenomena generally as radically
            contrasted with matter, regards them as the two sides, or
            aspects, of one and the same substance in some of its conditions.
            Thought as thought, they say, is utterly contrasted with material
            phenomena, but it must be also regarded as only <span class="tei tei-q">“the subjective side of nervous
            motion”</span>—whatever our learned men may mean by this.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return to
            the commentary on the Four Mahârâjahs, however, in the Egyptian
            temples, according to Clemens Alexandrinus, an immense curtain
            separated the tabernacle from the place for the congregation. The
            Jews had the same. In both, the curtain was drawn over five
            pillars (the Pentacle), symbolizing our five senses and five Root
            Races esoterically, while the four colours of the curtain
            represented the four cardinal points and the four terrestrial
            elements. The whole was an allegorical symbol. It is through the
            four high Rulers over the four points and elements that our five
            senses may become cognizant of the hidden truths of Nature; and
            not at all, as Clemens would have it, that it is the elements
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span> that furnished the
            Pagans with Divine Knowledge or the Knowledge of God.<a href="#note_226" id="noteref_226" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a>
            While the Egyptian emblem was spiritual, that of the Jews was
            purely materialistic, and, indeed, honoured only the blind
            elements and the imaginary <span class="tei tei-q">“points.”</span> For what was the meaning of the
            square Tabernacle raised by Moses in the wilderness, if it had
            not the same cosmical significance? <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou
            shalt make an hanging ... of blue, purple, and scarlet ... five
            pillars of shittim wood for the hanging ... four brazen rings in
            the four corners thereof ... boards of fine wood for the four
            sides, North, South, West, and East ... of the Tabernacle ...
            with Cherubims of cunning work.”</span><a href="#note_227" id="noteref_227" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> The
            Tabernacle and the square courtyard, Cherubim and all, were
            precisely the same as those in the Egyptian temples. The square
            form of the Tabernacle meant just the same thing as it still
            means, to this day, in the exoteric worship of the Chinese and
            Tibetans—the four cardinal points signifying that which the four
            sides of the pyramids, obelisks, and other such square erections
            mean. Josephus takes care to explain the whole thing. He declares
            that the Tabernacle pillars were the same as those raised at Tyre
            to the four elements, which were placed on pedestals whose four
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg151"></a> angles faced the
            four cardinal points; adding that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            angles of the pedestals had the four figures of the
            Zodiac”</span> on them, which represented the same
            orientation.<a href="#note_228" id="noteref_228" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The idea may
            be traced in the Zoroastrian caves, in the rock-cut temples of
            India, and in all the sacred square buildings of antiquity that
            have survived to this day. This is shown definitely by Layard,
            who finds the four cardinal points, and the four primitive
            elements, in the religion of every country, under the shape of
            square obelisks, the four sides of the pyramids, etc., etc. Of
            these elements and their points the Four Mahârâjahs were the
            regents and directors.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the student
            would know more of them, he has but to compare the Vision of
            Ezekiel (ch. i.) with what is known of Chinese Buddhism, even in
            its exoteric teachings, and examine the outward shape of these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Kings of the Devas.”</span> In the
            opinion of the Rev. Joseph Edkins, <span class="tei tei-q">“they
            preside each over one of the four continents into which the
            Hindûs divide the world.... Each leads an army of spiritual
            beings to protect mankind and Buddhism.”</span><a href="#note_229" id="noteref_229" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a>
            With the exception of favouritism towards Buddhism, the four
            Celestial Beings are precisely this. The Hindûs, however, happen
            to divide the world into seven continents, exoterically as well
            as esoterically; and their four Cosmic Devas are eight, presiding
            over the eight points of the compass and not over the
            continents.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Four”</span> are the protectors of
            mankind and also the agents of Karma on Earth, whereas the Lipika
            are concerned with Humanity's hereafter. At the same time they
            are the four living creatures, <span class="tei tei-q">“who have
            the likeness of a man,”</span> of Ezekiel's vision, called by the
            translators of the Bible, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cherubim,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Seraphim,”</span> etc.; by the Occultists,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Winged Globes,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery Wheels”</span>; and in the Hindû Pantheon, by
            a number of different names. All these Gandharvas, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sweet Songsters,”</span> the Asuras,
            Kinnaras, and Nâgas, are the allegorical descriptions of the Four
            Mahârâjahs. The Seraphim are the fiery Serpents of Heaven which
            we find in a passage, describing Mount Meru as <span class="tei tei-q">“the exalted mass of glory, the venerable haunt of
            gods and heavenly choristers ... not to be reached by sinful men
            ... because guarded by Serpents.”</span> They are called the
            Avengers, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Winged
            Wheels.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Their mission
            and character being explained, let us see what the Christian
            bible-interpreters say of the Cherubim. <span class="tei tei-q">“The word signifies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg152"></a> in Hebrew, fulness of knowledge; these
            angels are so called from their exquisite Knowledge, and were
            therefore used for the punishment of men who affected divine
            Knowledge.”</span> (Interpreted by Cruden in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Concordance</span></span>, from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span> iii. 24.) Very well;
            and vague as the information is, it shows that the Cherub placed
            at the gate of the Garden of Eden, after the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall,”</span> suggested to the venerable
            interpreters the idea of punishment connected with forbidden
            Science or divine Knowledge—one that generally leads to another
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall,”</span> that of the gods or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span> in man's estimation. But as
            the good old Cruden knew nought of Karma, he may be forgiven. Yet
            the allegory is suggestive. From Meru, the abode of gods, to
            Eden, the distance is very small, and from the Hindû Serpents to
            the Ophite Cherubim, the third out of the seven of which was the
            Dragon, the separation is still smaller, for both watched the
            entrance to the realm of Secret Knowledge. Ezekiel, moreover,
            plainly describes the four Cosmic Angels:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
            three chief Groups of Builders, and as many of the Planetary
            Spirits and the Lipika, each Group being again divided into seven
            sub-groups. It is impossible, even in such a large work as this,
            to enter into a minute examination of even the three principal
            Groups, as it would demand an extra volume. The Builders are the
            representatives of the first <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind-Born”</span> Entities, therefore of the
            primeval Rishi-Prajâpati; also of the Seven great Gods of Egypt,
            of which Osiris is the chief; of the Seven Amshaspends of the
            Zoroastrians, with Ormazd at their head; of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Spirits of the Face”</span>; of the Seven
            Sephiroth separated from the first Triad, etc., etc.<a href="#note_232" id="noteref_232" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>

            or rather rebuild, every <span class="tei tei-q">“System”</span>
            after the <span class="tei tei-q">“Night.”</span> The Second
            Group of the Builders is the Architect of our Planetary Chain
            exclusively; and the Third, the Progenitor of our Humanity—the
            macrocosmic prototype of the microcosm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Planetary
            Spirits are the informing spirits of the Stars in general, and of
            the Planets especially. They rule the destinies of men who are
            all born under one or other of their constellations; the Second
            and Third Groups pertaining to other systems have the same
            functions, and all rule various departments in Nature. In the
            Hindû exoteric Pantheon they are the guardian deities who preside
            over the eight points of the compass—the four cardinal and the
            four intermediate points—and are called Lokapâlas, <span class="tei tei-q">“Supporters or Guardians of the World”</span> (in our
            visible Cosmos), of which Indra (East), Yama (South), Varuna
            (West), and Kuvera (North) are the chief; their elephants and
            spouses pertaining of course to fancy and afterthought, though
            all of them have an Occult significance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Lipika, a
            description of whom is given in Commentary 6 of Stanza IV, are
            the Spirits of the Universe, whereas the Builders are only our
            own planetary deities. The former belong to the most Occult
            portion of cosmogenesis, which cannot be given here. Whether the
            Adepts—even the highest—know this angelic order in the
            completeness of its triple degrees, or only the lower one
            connected with the records of our world, is something which the
            writer is unprepared to say, and she would rather incline to the
            latter supposition. Of its highest grade one thing only is
            taught: the Lipika are connected with Karma—being its direct
            Recorders. The Symbol for Sacred and Secret Knowledge in
            antiquity was universally a Tree, by which a Scripture or a
            Record was also meant. Hence the word Lipika, the Writers or
            Scribes; the Dragons, symbols of Wisdom, who guard the Trees of
            Knowledge; the <span class="tei tei-q">“golden”</span> Apple-Tree
            of the Hesperides; the <span class="tei tei-q">“Luxuriant
            Trees”</span> and vegetation of Mount Meru, guarded by Serpents.
            Juno's giving Jupiter, on her marriage, a Tree with golden fruit,
            is another form of Eve offering Adam the apple from the Tree of
            Knowledge.</p>

            Angelic Hierarchy. From the Group of Four and Seven emanates the
            Mind-Born Groups of Ten, of Twelve, of Twenty-one, etc., all

            The Esoteric meaning of the first sentence of the Shloka is, that
            those who have been called Lipikas, the Recorders of the Karmic
            Ledger, make an impassible barrier between the personal
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em> and the impersonal
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Self</span></em>, the Noumenon and
            Parent-Source of the former. Hence the allegory. They
            circumscribe the manifested world of matter within the Ring
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Pass Not.”</span> This world is the
            objective symbol of the One divided into the Many, on the planes
            of Illusion, of Adi (the <span class="tei tei-q">“First”</span>)
            or of Eka (the <span class="tei tei-q">“One”</span>); and this
            One is the collective aggregate, or totality, of the principal
            Creators or Architects of this visible Universe. In Hebrew
            Occultism their name is both Achath, feminine, <span class="tei tei-q">“One,”</span> and Achad, <span class="tei tei-q">“One”</span> again, but masculine. The Monotheists
            have taken, and are still taking, advantage of the profound
            esotericism of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, to apply the name by
            which the One Supreme Essence is known, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em>
            manifestation, the Sephiroth-Elohim, and call it Jehovah. But
            this is quite arbitrary and against all reason and logic, as the
            term Elohim is a plural noun, identical with the plural word
            Chiim, often compounded with it. The sentence in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sepher
            Yetzirah</span></span> and elsewhere, <span class="tei tei-q">“Achath-Ruach-Elohim-Chiim,”</span> denotes the
            Elohim as androgynous at best, the feminine element almost
            predominating, as it would read: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span> is She the Spirit of
            the Elohim of Life.”</span> As said, Achath (or Echath) is
            feminine, and Achad (or Echad) masculine, both meaning One.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, in
            Occult metaphysics, there are, properly speaking, two
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ones”</span>—the One on the unreachable
            plane of Absoluteness and Infinity, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg155"></a> on which no speculation is possible; and
            the second One on the plane of Emanations. The former can neither
            emanate nor be divided, as it is eternal, absolute, and
            immutable; but the second, being, so to speak, the reflection of
            the first One (for it is the Logos, or Îshvara, in the Universe
            of Illusion), can do so. It emanates from itself—as the upper
            Sephirothal Triad emanates the lower seven Sephiroth—the seven
            Rays or Dhyân Chohans; in other words, the Homogeneous becomes
            the Heterogeneous, the Protyle differentiates into the Elements.
            But these, unless they return into their primal Element, can
            never cross beyond the Laya, or zero-point. This metaphysical
            tenet can hardly be better described than in T. Subba Row's
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavadgîtâ</span></span> Lectures:</p>

            energy which is unborn and eternal, and which exists in the bosom
            of Parabrahman at the time of Pralaya, and starts as a centre of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For, as the
            lecturer premised by saying, Parabrahman is not this or that, it
            is not even consciousness, as it cannot be related to matter or
            anything conditioned. It is not Ego nor is it Non-Ego, nor even
            Âtmâ, but verily the one source of all manifestations and modes
            of existence.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus in the
            allegory, the Lipika separate the world (or plane) of pure Spirit
            from that of Matter. Those who <span class="tei tei-q">“descend
            and ascend”</span>—the incarnating Monads, and men striving
            towards purification and <span class="tei tei-q">“ascending,”</span> but still not having quite
            reached the goal—may cross the Circle of <span class="tei tei-q">“Pass Not,”</span> only on the Day <span class="tei tei-q">“Be With Us”</span>; that day when man, freeing
            himself from the trammels of ignorance, and recognizing fully the
            non-separateness of the Ego within his Personality—erroneously
            regarded as his own—from the Universal Ego (Anima Supra-Mundi),
            merges thereby into the One Essence, to become not only one with
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Us,”</span> the manifested universal
            Lives which are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> Life, but that very Life
            itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
            Astronomically, the Ring <span class="tei tei-q">“Pass
            Not”</span> that the Lipika trace round <span class="tei tei-q">“the Triangle, the First One, the Cube, the Second
            One, and the Pentacle,”</span> to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg156"></a> circumscribe these figures, is thus again
            shown to contain the symbols of 31415, or the coëfficient
            constantly used in mathematical tables, the value π (pi), the
            geometrical figures standing here for numerical figures.
            According to the general philosophical teachings, this Ring is
            beyond the region of what are called nebulæ in astronomy. But
            this is as erroneous a conception as that of the topography and
            descriptions, given in Purânic and other exoteric Scriptures,
            about the 1008 worlds of the Deva-loka worlds and firmaments.
            There are worlds, of course, in the esoteric as well as in the
            profane scientific teachings, at such incalculable distances that
            the light of the nearest of them, though it has only just reached
            our modern <span class="tei tei-q">“Chaldees,”</span> may have
            left its luminary long before the day on which the words,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Let there be Light,”</span> were
            pronounced; but these are not worlds on the Devalokic plane, but
            in our Cosmos.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Chemist
            goes to the laya or zero-point of the plane of matter with which
            he deals, and then stops short. The Physicist or the Astronomer
            counts billions of miles beyond the nebulæ, and then he also
            stops short. The semi-initiated Occultist also will represent
            this laya-point to himself as existing on some plane which, if
            not physical, is still conceivable to the human intellect. But
            the full Initiate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knows</span></em> that the Ring <span class="tei tei-q">“Pass Not”</span> is neither a locality, nor can it
            be measured by distance, but that it exists in the absoluteness
            of Infinity. In this <span class="tei tei-q">“Infinity”</span> of
            the full Initiate, there is neither height, breadth nor
            thickness, but all is fathomless profundity, reaching down from
            the physical to the <span class="tei tei-q">“para-metaphysical.”</span> In using the word
            <span class="tei tei-q">“down,”</span> essential
            depth—<span class="tei tei-q">“nowhere and everywhere”</span>—is
            meant, not depth of physical matter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If one
            carefully searches through the exoteric and grossly
            anthropomorphic allegories of popular religions, even in these
            the doctrine embodied in the Circle of <span class="tei tei-q">“Pass Not,”</span> guarded by the Lipika, may be
            dimly perceived. Thus one finds it even in the teachings of the
            Vedântin sect of the Visishthadvaita, the most tenaciously
            anthropomorphic in all India. For we read of the released soul
            that, after reaching Moksha—a state of bliss meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“release from Bandha,”</span> or bondage—bliss is
            enjoyed by it in a place called Paramapada, which place is not
            material, but made of Suddasattva, the essence, of which the body
            of Îshvara—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord”</span>—is formed.
            There, Muktas or Jîvâtmâs (Monads) who have attained Moksha, are
            never again subject to the qualities of either matter or Karma.

            the truly Infinite. The Spirits referred to, therefore, as those

            moment, its ant-hill, the labour of many weeks—long years in the
            chronology of insects. The ant, feeling it acutely, may also,
            like man, attribute the undeserved calamity to a combination of
            providence and sin, and see in it the result of the sin of its
            first parent. Who knows, and who can affirm or deny? The refusal
            to admit, in the whole Solar System, of any other reasonable and
            intellectual beings than ourselves on the human plane, is the
            greatest conceit <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg

            are no invisible Intelligences living under the same conditions
            as we do. It cannot deny point-blank the possibility of there
            being worlds within worlds, under conditions totally different to
            those that constitute the nature of our world; nor can it deny
            that there may be a certain limited communication between some of

            communicate with their progeny of the Earth; a progeny which is
            indissolubly linked with them, each Principle in man having its
            direct source in the nature of these great Beings, who furnish us
            respectively with the invisible elements in us. Physical Science
            is welcome to speculate upon the physiological mechanism of
            living beings, and to continue her fruitless efforts in trying to
            resolve our feelings, our sensations, mental and spiritual, into
            functions of their organic vehicles. Nevertheless, all that will
            ever be accomplished in this direction has already been done, and
            Science can go no farther. She is before a dead wall, on the face
            of which she traces, as she imagines, great physiological and
            psychic discoveries, every one of which will be shown later on to
            be no better than cobwebs, spun by her scientific fancies and

            subservient to the analysis and researches of Physiological
            Science. The six higher Principles in them will evade for ever
            the hand that is guided by an animus, which purposely ignores and
            rejects the Occult Sciences. All that modern physiological
            research in connection with psychological problems has, and owing
            to the nature of things could have shown, is that every thought,
            sensation, and emotion is attended with a re-marshalling of the
            molecules of certain nerves. The inference drawn by scientists of
            the type of Büchner, Vogt, and others, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg159"></a> thought is molecular motion,

            still better replaced with either of the two terms <span class="tei tei-q">“remain”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“rest with
            us,”</span> as it refers to that long period of Rest which is
            called Paranirvâna. <span class="tei tei-q">“Le Jour de

            radiated Entities, different in substance, but not in essence. As
            expressed by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavadgîtâ</span></span> lecturer,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“it must not be supposed that the Logos

            expressions, <span class="tei tei-q">“The Day of Come to
            Us”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“The Day of Be With

            sacred Forces or Powers—Tetraktys—so the Circle shows the
            boundary within the Infinity that no man, even in spirit, or Deva
            or Dhyân Chohan can cross. The Spirits of those who <span class="tei tei-q">“descend and ascend,”</span> during the course of
            cyclic evolution, shall cross the <span class="tei tei-q">“iron-bound world,”</span> only on the day of their
            approach to the threshold of Paranirvâna. If they reach it, they
            will rest in the bosom of Parabrahman, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknown Darkness,”</span> which shall then become
            for all of them Light, during the whole period of Mahâpralaya,
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Night,”</span> namely,
            311,040,000,000,000 years of absorption in Brahman. The Day of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Be With Us”</span> is this period of
            Rest, or Paranirvâna. It corresponds to the Day of the Last
            Judgment of the Christians, which has been sorely materialized in
            their religion.<a href="#note_244" id="noteref_244" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As in the

            translated from the Chinese text, and the names given as the
            equivalents of the original terms are preserved. The real
            Esoteric nomenclature cannot be given, as it would only confuse
            the reader. The Brâhmanical doctrine has no equivalents for
            these. Vâch seems, in many an aspect, to approach the Chinese
            Kwan-Yin, but there is no regular worship of Vâch under this name
            in India, as there is of Kwan-Yin in China. No exoteric religious
            system has ever adopted a female Creator, and thus, from the
            first dawn of popular religions, woman has been regarded and
            treated as inferior to man. It is only in China and Egypt that
            Kwan-Yin and Isis are placed on a par with the male gods.
            Esotericism ignores both sexes. Its highest Deity is as sexless
            as it is formless, neither Father nor Mother; and its first
            manifested beings, celestial and terrestrial alike, become only
            gradually androgynous to finally separate into distinct
            sexes.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Kwan-Yin-Tien”</span> means the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Melodious Heaven of Sound,”</span> the
            Abode of Kwan-Yin, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine
            Voice.”</span> This <span class="tei tei-q">“Voice”</span> is a
            synonym of the Verbum or Word, <span class="tei tei-q">“Speech,”</span> as the expression of Thought. Thus
            may be traced the connection with, and even the origin of, the
            Hebrew Bath-Kol, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Daughter of the
            Divine Voice,”</span> or Verbum, or the male and female Logos,
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Man,”</span> or Adam
            Kadmon, who is at the same time Sephira. The latter was surely
            anticipated by the Hindû Vâch, the goddess of Speech, or of the
            Word. For Vâch—the daughter and the female portion, as is stated,
            of Brahmâ, one <span class="tei tei-q">“generated by the
            gods”</span>—is, in company with Kwan-Yin, with Isis (also the
            daughter, wife and sister of Osiris) and other goddesses, the
            female Logos, so to speak, the goddess of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em> forces in Nature, the
            Word, Voice or Sound, and Speech. If Kwan-Yin is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Melodious Voice,”</span> so is Vâch <span class="tei tei-q">“the melodious cow who milked forth sustenance and
            water [the female principle] ... who yields us nourishment and
            sustenance,”</span> as Mother-Nature. She is associated in the
            work of creation with Prajâpati. She is male and female
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
            libitum</span></span>, as Eve is with Adam. And she is a form of
            Aditi—the principle higher than Æther—of Âkâsha, the synthesis of
            all the forces in Nature. Thus Vâch and Kwan-Yin are both the
            magic potency of Occult Sound in Nature and Æther—which
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Voice”</span> calls forth Sien-Tchan,
            the illusive form of the Universe out of Chaos and the Seven
            Elements.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manu</span></span>, Brahmâ (the Logos also)
            is shown dividing his body into two parts, male and female, and

            again. A learned Vedântin Occultist speaks of this <span class="tei tei-q">“goddess”</span> as follows, explaining the reason
            why Îshvara (or Brahmâ) is called Verbum or Logos; why in fact it
            is called Sabda Brahman:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The explanation I am going to give you will
            appear thoroughly mystical; but if mystical, it has a tremendous
            significance when properly understood. Our old writers said that
            Vâch is of four kinds. [See</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Rig

              Vaikharî Vâch is what we utter. Every kind of Vaikharî Vâch
              exists in its Madhyama, further in its Pashyanti, and
              ultimately in its Para form.</span><a href="#note_249" id="noteref_249" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">The reason why this Pranava is
              called Vâch is this, that the four principles of the great
              cosmos correspond to these four forms of Vâch. Now the whole
              manifested solar system exists in its Sûkshma form in the light
              or energy of the Logos, because its energy is caught up and
              transferred to cosmic matter ... the whole cosmos in its
              objective form is Vaikharî Vâch, the light of the Logos is the
              Madhyama form, and the Logos itself the Pashyanti form, and
              Parabrahman the Para aspect of that Vâch. It is by the light of
              this explanation that we must try to understand certain
              statements made by various philosophers to the effect that the
              manifested cosmos is the Verbum manifested as
              cosmos.</span><a href="#note_250" id="noteref_250" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">250</span></span></a></p>

            The seven Laya Centres are the seven zero-points, using the term
            zero in the same sense that Chemists do. It indicates, in
            Esotericism, a point at which the reckoning of differentiation
            begins. From these Centres—beyond which Esoteric Philosophy
            allows us to perceive the dim metaphysical outlines of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Sons”</span> of Life and Light,
            the Seven Logoi of the Hermetic and all other philosophers—begins
            the differentiation of the Elements which enter into the
            constitution of our Solar System. It has often been asked what is
            the exact definition of Fohat and his powers and functions, for
            he seems to exercise those of a Personal God as understood in the
            popular religions. The answer has just been given in the
            Commentary on Stanza V. As well said in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavadgîtâ</span></span> Lectures,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The whole cosmos must necessarily exist

            emanates.”</span> Whether we count the principles in cosmos and
            man as seven or only as four, the forces of, and in, physical
            Nature are Seven; and it is stated by the same authority that,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Prajnâ, or the capacity of perception,
            exists in seven different aspects corresponding to the seven
            conditions of matter.”</span> For, <span class="tei tei-q">“just
            as a human being is composed of seven principles, differentiated
            matter in the solar system exists in seven different
            conditions.”</span><a href="#note_252" id="noteref_252" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a> So
            does Fohat. Fohat has several meanings, as already shown. He is
            called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Builder of the
            Builders,”</span> the Force that he personifies having formed our
            Septenary Chain. He is One and Seven, and on the cosmic plane is
            behind all such manifestations as light, heat, sound, adhesion,
            etc., etc., and is the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit”</span> of
            electricity, which is the Life of the Universe. As an
            abstraction, we will call it the One Life; as an objective and
            evident Reality, we speak of a septenary scale of manifestation,
            which begins at the upper rung with the One Unknowable Causality,
            and ends as Omnipresent Mind and Life, immanent in every atom of
            Matter. Thus, while Science speaks of its evolution through brute
            matter, blind force, and senseless motion, the Occultists point
            to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Intelligent</span></em> Law and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sentient</span></em> Life, and add that
            Fohat is the guiding Spirit of all this. Yet he is no personal
            god at all, but the emanation of those other Powers behind him,
            whom the Christians call the <span class="tei tei-q">“Messengers”</span> of their God (in reality, of the
            Elohim, or rather one of the Seven Creators called Elohim), and

            Although these Stanzas refer to the whole Universe after a
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg164"></a> Mahâpralaya
            (Universal Dissolution), yet this sentence, as any student of
            Occultism may see, refers also by analogy to the evolution and
            final formation of the primitive (though compound) seven Elements
            on our Earth. Of these, four Elements are now fully manifested,
            while the fifth—Ether—is only partially so, as we are hardly in
            the second half of the Fourth Round, and consequently the fifth
            Element will manifest fully only in the Fifth Round. The Worlds,
            including our own, as germs, were of course primarily evolved
            from the One Element in its second stage—<span class="tei tei-q">“Father-Mother,”</span> the Differentiated World's
            Soul, not what is termed the <span class="tei tei-q">“Over-Soul”</span> by Emerson—whether we call it,
            with Modern Science, cosmic dust and fire-mist, or with
            Occultism, Âkâsha, Jîvâtmâ, Divine Astral Light, or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul of the World.”</span> But this
            first stage of Evolution was in due course of time followed by
            the next. No World, and no heavenly body, could be constructed on
            the objective plane, had not the Elements been already
            sufficiently differentiated from their primeval Ilus, resting in
            Laya. The latter term is a synonym of Nirvâna. It is, in fact,
            the Nirvânic dissociation of all substances, merged after a
            Life-Cycle into the latency of their primary conditions. It is
            the luminous but bodiless shadow of the Matter that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>,
            the realm of negativeness—wherein lie latent during their period
            of rest the active Forces of the Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, speaking
            of Elements, it is made the standing reproach of the Ancients,
            that they <span class="tei tei-q">“supposed their elements simple
            and undecomposable.”</span> The shades of our pre-historic
            ancestors might return the compliment to modern Physicists, now
            that new discoveries in Chemistry have led Mr. W. Crookes,
            F.R.S., to admit, that Science is yet a thousand leagues from a
            knowledge of the compound nature of the simplest molecule. From
            him we learn that such a thing as a really simple molecule
            entirely homogeneous is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
            incognita</span></span> in Chemistry. <span class="tei tei-q">“Where are we to draw the line?”</span> he asks;
            <span class="tei tei-q">“is there no way out of this perplexity?
            Must we either make the elementary examinations so stiff that
            only 60 or 70 candidates can pass, or must we open the
            examination doors so wide that the number of admissions is
            limited only by the number of applicants?”</span> And then the
            learned chemist gives striking instances. He says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Take the case of yttrium. It has its definite
            atomic weight, it behaved in every respect as a simple body, an
            element, to which we might indeed add, but from which we could
            not take away. Yet this yttrium, this supposed homogeneous whole,
            on being submitted to a certain method of fractionation, is
            resolved into</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg
            165]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg165"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">portions not
            absolutely identical among themselves, and exhibiting a gradation
            of properties. Or take the case of didymium. Here was a body
            betraying all the recognized characters of an element. It had
            been separated with much difficulty from other bodies which
            approximated closely to it in their properties, and during this
            crucial process it had undergone very severe treatment and very
            close scrutiny. But then came another chemist, who, treating this
            assumed homogeneous body by a peculiar process of fractionation,
            resolved it into the two bodies praseodymium and neodymium,
            between which certain distinctions are perceptible. Further, we
            even now have no certainty that neodymium and praseodymium are
            simple bodies. On the contrary, they likewise exhibit symptoms of
            splitting up. Now, if one supposed element on proper treatment is
            thus found to comprise dissimilar molecules, we are surely
            warranted in asking whether similar results might not be obtained
            in other elements, perhaps in all elements, if treated in the
            right way. We may even ask where the process of sorting-out is to
            stop—a process which of course presupposes variations between the
            individual molecules of each species. And in these successive
            separations we naturally find bodies approaching more and more
            closely to each other.</span><a href="#note_255" id="noteref_255" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">255</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more this
            reproach against the Ancients is an unwarrantable statement.
            Their initiated philosophers at any rate, can hardly come under
            such an imputation, since it is they who have invented allegories
            and religious myths from the beginning. Had they been ignorant of
            the Heterogeneity of their Elements they would have had no
            personifications of Fire, Air, Water, Earth, and Æther; their
            cosmic gods and goddesses would never have been blessed with such
            posterity, with so many sons and daughters, elements born
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em> each respective Element.
            Alchemy and Occult phenomena would have been a delusion and a
            snare, even in theory, had the Ancients been ignorant of the
            potentialities and correlative functions and attributes, of every
            element that enters into the composition of Air, Water, Earth,
            and even Fire—the latter a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terra
            incognita</span></span> to this day to Modern Science, which is
            obliged to call it motion, evolution of light and heat, state of
            ignition—defining it by its outward aspects in short, in
            ignorance of its nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But what
            Modern Science seems to fail to perceive, is that, differentiated
            as may have been those simple chemical atoms—which archaic
            philosophy called <span class="tei tei-q">“the creators of their
            respective parents,”</span> fathers, brothers, husbands of their
            mothers, and these mothers the daughters of their own sons, like
            Aditi and Daksha, for example—differentiated as these elements
            were in the beginning, still, they were not the compound bodies
            known to Science, as they are now. Neither Water, Air,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg166"></a> nor Earth (a
            synonym for solids generally) existed in their present form,
            representing the only three states of matter recognized by
            Science; for all these and even Fire are productions already
            recombined by the atmospheres of completely formed globes, so
            that in the first periods of the earth's formation they were
            something quite <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sui generis</span></span>. Now that the
            conditions and laws ruling our Solar System are fully developed,
            and that the atmosphere of our earth, as of every other globe,
            has become, so to say, a crucible of its own, Occult Science
            teaches that there is a perpetual exchange taking place, in
            space, of molecules, or rather of atoms, correlating, and thus
            changing their combining equivalents on every planet. Some men of
            Science, and these among the greatest Physicists and Chemists,
            begin to suspect this fact, which has been known for ages to the
            Occultists. The spectroscope shows only the probable similarity
            (on external evidence) of terrestrial and sidereal substance; it
            is unable to go any farther, or to show whether or not atoms
            gravitate towards one another in the same way, and under the same
            conditions, as they are supposed to do on our planet, physically
            and chemically. The scale of temperature, from the highest degree
            to the lowest that can be conceived of, may be imagined to be one
            and the same in and for the whole Universe; nevertheless, its
            properties, other than those of dissociation and reässociation,
            differ on every planet; and thus atoms enter into new forms of
            existence, undreamed of, and incognizable to, Physical Science.
            As already expressed in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Five Years of Theosophy</span></span>,<a href="#note_256" id="noteref_256" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> the
            essence of cometary matter, for instance, <span class="tei tei-q">“is totally different from any of the chemical or
            physical characteristics with which the greatest Chemists and
            Physicists of the earth are acquainted.”</span> And even that
            matter, during rapid passage through our atmosphere, undergoes a
            certain change in its nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus not only
            the elements of our planet, but even those of all its sisters in
            the Solar System, differ in their combinations as widely from
            each other, as from the cosmic elements beyond our solar limits.
            This is again corroborated by the same man of Science in the
            lecture referred to above, who quotes Clerk Maxwell, saying
            <span class="tei tei-q">“that the elements are not absolutely
            homogeneous.”</span> He writes:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It is difficult to conceive of selection and
            elimination of intermediate varieties, for where can these
            eliminated molecules have gone to, if, as we have reason to
            believe, the hydrogen, etc., of the fixed stars is composed of
            molecules identical in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page167">[pg 167]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg167"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">all respects
            with our own.... In the first place we may call in question this
            absolute molecular identity, since we have hitherto had no means
            for coming to a conclusion save the means furnished by the
            spectroscope, while it is admitted that, for accurately comparing
            and discriminating the spectra of two bodies, they should be
            examined under identical states of temperature, pressure, and all
            other physical conditions. We have certainly seen, in the
            spectrum of the sun, rays which we have not been able to
            identify.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, the
            elements of our planet cannot be taken as a standard for
            comparison with the elements in other worlds. In fact each world
            has its Fohat, which is omnipresent in its own sphere of action.
            But there are as many Fohats as there are worlds, each varying in
            power and degree of manifestation. The individual Fohats make one
            universal, collective Fohat—the aspect-entity of the one absolute
            Non-Entity, which is absolute Be-ness, Sat. <span class="tei tei-q">“Millions and billions of worlds are produced at
            every Manvantara”</span>—it is said. Therefore there must be many
            Fohats, whom we consider as conscious and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligent</span></em> Forces. This, no
            doubt, to the disgust of scientific minds. Nevertheless the
            Occultists, who have good reasons for it, consider all the forces
            of Nature as veritable, though supersensuous, states of Matter;
            and as possible objects of perception to beings endowed with the
            requisite senses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Enshrined in
            its pristine, virgin state within the Bosom of the Eternal
            Mother, every atom born beyond the threshold of her realm is
            doomed to incessant differentiation. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Mother sleeps, yet is ever
            breathing</span></span>.”</span> And every breath sends out into
            the plane of manifestation her protean products, which, carried
            on by the wave of efflux, are scattered by Fohat, and driven
            toward or beyond this or another planetary atmosphere. Once
            caught by the latter, the atom is lost; its pristine purity is
            gone for ever, unless fate dissociates it by leading it to a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“current of efflux”</span> (an Occult
            term meaning quite a different process from that which the
            ordinary word implies), when it may be carried once more to the
            borderland where it had previously perished, and taking its
            flight, not into Space <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></em> but into Space <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>, be brought under a state
            of differential equilibrium and happily reabsorbed. Were a truly
            learned Occultist-Alchemist to write the <span class="tei tei-q">“Life and Adventures of an Atom,”</span> he would
            secure thereby the supreme scorn of the modern Chemist, though
            perchance also his subsequent gratitude. Indeed, if such an
            imaginary Chemist happened to be intuitional, and would for a
            moment step out of the habitual groove of strictly <span class="tei tei-q">“Exact Science,”</span> as the Alchemists of old did,
            he might be repaid <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg
            168]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg168"></a>
            for his audacity. However it may be, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Breath of the Father-Mother issues cold

            cold pure air on the mountain-top, and throws it out impure, hot
            and transformed. Thus, the higher atmosphere of every globe,
            being its mouth, and the lower its lungs, the man of our planet
            breathes only the <span class="tei tei-q">“refuse of

            into ozone to a measure of alchemical activity, reducing it to
            its pure essence (for which there are means), would discover
            thereby a substitute for an <span class="tei tei-q">“Elixir of

            conception of the Archaic Cosmogony, whose theories have now
            passed into Occultism. At present, one thing may be stated. The
            Worlds are built neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upon</span></em>, nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">over</span></em>,
            nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> the Laya Centres, the
            zero-point being a condition, not a mathematical point.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
            Bear in mind that Fohat, the constructive Force of Cosmic
            Electricity, is said, metaphorically, to have sprung, like Rudra
            from the head of Brahmâ, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">from the Brain of
            the Father and the Bosom of the Mother</span></span>,”</span> and
            then to have metamorphosed himself into a male and a female,
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, polarized himself into
            positive and negative electricity. He has <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seven
            Sons</span></span> who are his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brothers</span></span>. Fohat is forced to
            be born, time after time, whenever any two of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Son-Brothers”</span> indulge in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">too close
            contact</span></em>—whether an embrace or a fight. To avoid this,
            he unites and binds together those of unlike nature, and
            separates those of similar temperaments. This, as any one can
            see, relates, of course, to electricity generated by friction,
            and to the law of attraction between two objects of unlike, and
            repulsion between those of like polarity. The Seven Son-Brothers,
            however, represent and personify the seven forms of cosmic
            magnetism, called in Practical Occultism the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Radicals,”</span> whose coöperative and active
            progeny are, among other energies, Electricity, Magnetism, Sound,
            Light, Heat, Cohesion, etc. Occult Science defines all these as
            super-sensuous effects in their hidden behaviour, and as
            objective phenomena in the world of sense; the former requiring
            abnormal faculties to perceive them, the latter cognizable by our
            ordinary physical senses. They all pertain to, and are the
            emanations of, still more supersensuous spiritual qualities, not
            personated by, but belonging to, real and conscious Causes. To
            attempt a description of such Entities would be worse than
            useless. The reader must bear in mind that, according to our
            teaching which regards this phenomenal Universe as a Great
            Illusion, the nearer a body is to the Unknown Substance, the more
            it approaches Reality, as being the farther removed from this
            world of Mâyâ. Therefore, though the molecular constitution of
            these bodies is not deducible from their manifestations, on this
            plane of consciousness, they nevertheless, from the standpoint of
            the Adept Occultist, possess a distinctive objective if not
            material structure, in the relatively noumenal—as opposed to the
            phenomenal—Universe. Men of science may term them force or forces
            generated by matter, or <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of its
            motion,”</span> if they will; Occultism sees in these effects
            Elementals (Forces), and, in the direct causes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg170"></a> producing them, intelligent
            Divine Workmen. The intimate connection of these Elementals,
            guided by the unerring hand of the Rulers, with the elements of
            pure Matter—their correlation we might call it—results in our
            terrestrial phenomena, such as light, heat, magnetism, etc., etc.
            Of course we shall never agree with the American
            Substantialists<a href="#note_259" id="noteref_259" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a> who
            call every force and energy—whether light, heat, electricity or
            cohesion—an <span class="tei tei-q">“entity”</span>; for this
            would be equivalent to calling the noise produced by the rolling
            of the wheels of a vehicle an entity—thus confusing and
            identifying that <span class="tei tei-q">“noise”</span> with the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“driver”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outside</span></em>, and the guiding
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Master Intelligence”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em> the vehicle. But we do
            certainly give that name to the <span class="tei tei-q">“drivers”</span> and to these guiding <span class="tei tei-q">“Intelligences,”</span> the ruling Dhyân Chohans, as
            has been shown. The Elementals, the Nature-Forces, are the
            acting, though invisible, or rather imperceptible, secondary
            causes, and in themselves the effects of primary causes behind
            the veil of all terrestrial phenomena. Electricity, light, heat,
            etc., have been aptly termed the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ghosts
            or Shadows of Matter in Motion,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            supersensuous states of Matter whose effects only we are able to
            cognize. To expand, then, the simile given above. The sensation
            of light is like the sound of the rolling wheels—a purely
            phenomenal effect, having no existence outside the observer. The
            proximate exciting cause of the sensation is comparable to the
            driver—a supersensuous state of matter in motion, a Nature-Force
            or Elemental. But, behind this—just as the owner of the carriage
            directs the driver from within—stands the higher and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">noumenal</span></em> cause, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Intelligence</span></em> from whose essence
            radiate these States of <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother,”</span>
            generating the countless milliards of Elementals, or Psychic
            Nature-Spirits, just as every drop of water generates its
            physical infinitesimal Infusoria. It is Fohat who guides the
            transfer of the principles from one planet to the other, from one
            star to another child-star. When a planet dies, its informing
            principles are transferred to a laya or sleeping centre, with
            potential but latent energy in it, which is thus awakened into
            life and begins to form itself into a new sidereal body.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is most
            remarkable that, while honestly confessing their entire ignorance
            of the true nature of even terrestrial matter—primordial
            substance being regarded more as a dream than as a sober
            reality—the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg

            Physicists should, nevertheless, set themselves up as judges of
            that matter, and claim to know what it is able and is not able to
            do, in various combinations. Scientists know this matter hardly
            skin-deep, and yet they will dogmatize. It is <span class="tei tei-q">“a mode of motion”</span> and nothing else! But the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“force”</span> that is inherent in a
            living person's breath, when blowing a speck of dust from the
            table, is also, undeniably, <span class="tei tei-q">“a mode of
            motion.”</span> It is as undeniably not a quality of the matter,
            or the particles of the speck, and it emanates from the living
            and thinking Entity that breathed, whether the impulse originated
            consciously or unconsciously. Indeed, to endow matter—something
            of which nothing is so far known—with an inherent quality called
            force, of the nature of which still less is known, is to create a
            far more serious difficulty than that which lies in the
            acceptation of the intervention of our <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature-Spirits”</span> in every natural
            phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Occultists—who, if they would express themselves correctly, do

            eternal—assert that all the so-called Forces of Nature,
            electricity, magnetism, light, heat, etc., etc., far from being
            modes of motion of material particles, are <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            esse</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in their ultimate
            constitution, the differentiated aspects of that Universal Motion
            which is discussed and explained in the first pages of this
            volume. When Fohat is said to produce Seven Laya Centres, it
            means that, for formative or creative purposes, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Great
            Law</span></span>—Theists may call it God—stays, or rather
            modifies, its perpetual motion on seven invisible points within
            the area of the Manifested Universe. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Great Breath digs through Space seven
            holes into Laya, to cause them to circumgyrate during
            Manvantara</span></span>,”</span> says the Occult Catechism. We
            have said that Laya is what Science may call the zero-point or
            line; the realm of absolute negativeness, or the one real
            absolute Force, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">noumenon</span></span> of the Seventh State
            of that which we ignorantly call and recognize as <span class="tei tei-q">“Force”</span>; or again the noumenon of
            Undifferentiated Cosmic Substance, which is itself an unreachable
            and unknowable object for finite perception; the root and basis
            of all states of objectivity and also subjectivity; the neutral
            axis, not one of the many aspects, but its centre. It may serve
            to elucidate the meaning, if we try to imagine a <span class="tei tei-q">“neutral centre”</span>—the dream of those who would
            discover perpetual motion. A <span class="tei tei-q">“neutral
            centre”</span> is, in one aspect, the limiting point of any given
            set of senses. Thus, imagine two consecutive planes of matter;
            each of these corresponding to an appropriate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg172"></a> set of perceptive organs. We
            are forced to admit that between these two planes of matter an
            incessant circulation takes place; and if we follow the atoms and
            molecules of, say, the lower in their transformation upwards,
            they will come to a point where they pass altogether beyond the
            range of the faculties we are using on the lower plane. In fact,
            for us the matter of the lower plane there vanishes from our
            perception—or rather, it passes on to the higher plane, and the
            state of matter corresponding to such a point of transition must
            certainly possess special, and not readily discoverable,
            properties. Seven such <span class="tei tei-q">“Neutral

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Primordial
            Atom (Anu) cannot be multiplied either in its pregenetic state,
            or its primogeneity; therefore it is called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sum Total,”</span> of course, figuratively, as that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sum Total”</span> is boundless. That
            which is the abyss of nothingness to the Physicist, who knows
            only the world of visible causes and effects, is the boundless
            Space of the Divine Plenum to the Occultist. Among many other
            objections to the doctrine of an endless evolution and
            involution, or reäbsorption of the Kosmos, a process which,
            according to the Brâhmanical and Esoteric Doctrine, is without
            beginning or end, the Occultist is told that it cannot be, since
            <span class="tei tei-q">“by all the admissions of modern
            scientific philosophy it is a necessity of nature to run
            down.”</span> If the tendency of nature <span class="tei tei-q">“to run down”</span> is to be considered so forcible
            an objection to Occult Cosmogony, how, we may ask, do your
            Positivists and Free-thinkers and Scientists account for the
            phalanx of active stellar systems around us? They had eternity to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“run down”</span> in; why, then, is not
            the Kosmos a huge inert mass? Even the moon is only
            hypothetically believed to be a dead planet, <span class="tei tei-q">“run down,”</span> and Astronomy does not seem to be
            acquainted with many such dead planets.<a href="#note_261" id="noteref_261" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a> The
            query is unanswerable. But apart from this, it must be noted that
            the idea of the amount of <span class="tei tei-q">“transformable
            energy”</span> in our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg
            173]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg173"></a>
            little system coming to an end, is based purely on the fallacious
            conception of a <span class="tei tei-q">“white-hot, incandescent
            sun,”</span> perpetually radiating away its heat without
            compensation into space. To this we reply that nature runs down
            and disappears from the objective plane, only to reëmerge after a
            time of rest out of the subjective, and to reäscend once more.
            Our Kosmos and Nature will run down only to reäppear on a more
            perfect plane after every Pralaya. The Matter of the Eastern
            philosophers is not the <span class="tei tei-q">“matter”</span>
            and Nature of the Western metaphysicians. For what is Matter? And
            above all, what is our scientific philosophy but that which was
            so justly and so politely defined by Kant as the <span class="tei tei-q">“science of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">limits</span></em> to our knowledge?”</span>
            To what have the many attempts made by Science to bind, connect,
            and define all the phenomena of organic life, by mere physical
            and chemical manifestations, brought it? To speculation
            generally—mere soap-bubbles, that have burst one after the other
            before the men of Science were permitted to discover real facts.
            All this would have been avoided, and the progress of knowledge
            would have proceeded with gigantic strides, had only Science and
            its philosophy abstained from accepting hypotheses merely on the
            one-sided knowledge of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“matter.”</span> The behaviour of Uranus and
            Neptune—whose satellites, four and one in number respectively,
            revolved, it was thought, in their orbits from East to West,
            whereas all the other satellites rotate from West to East—is a
            very good instance, as showing how unreliable are all
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à
            priori</span></span> speculations, even when based on the
            strictest mathematical analysis. The famous hypothesis of the
            formation of our Solar System out of nebulous rings, put forward
            by Kant and Laplace, was chiefly based on the assumed fact that
            all the planets revolved in the same direction. Laplace, relying
            on this mathematically demonstrated fact in his own time, and
            calculating on the theory of probabilities, offered to bet three
            milliards to one that the next planet discovered would have in
            its system the same peculiarity of motion eastward. The immutable
            laws of scientific mathematics got <span class="tei tei-q">“worsted by further experiments and
            observations.”</span> This idea of Laplace's mistake prevails
            generally to this day; but some Astronomers have finally
            succeeded in demonstrating (?) that the error has been in
            accepting Laplace's assertion for a mistake; and steps to correct
            the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">bévue</span></span>, without attracting
            general attention, are now being taken. Many such unpleasant
            surprises are in store for hypotheses of even a purely physical
            character. What further disillusions, then, may there not be
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg174"></a> in questions
            concerning a transcendental, Occult Nature? At any rate,
            Occultism teaches that the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“reverse rotation”</span> is a fact.</p>

            the Naturalist, how can any Materialist limit the laws which
            govern the changes in the conditions and being of the atoms in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With this
            Shloka ends that portion of the Stanzas relating to the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg175"></a> cosmogony of the
            Universe after the last Mahâpralaya, or Universal Dissolution,
            which, when it comes, sweeps out of Space every differentiated
            thing, gods as well as atoms, like so many dry leaves. From this
            verse onwards, the Stanzas are only concerned with our Solar
            System in general, with the Planetary Chains therein
            inferentially, and with the history of our Globe (the Fourth and
            its Chain) especially. All the verses which follow in this Volume
            refer only to the evolution of, and on, our Earth. With regard to
            the latter, a strange tenet—strange from the modern scientific
            standpoint only, of course—is held, which ought to be made
            known.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before
            entirely new and somewhat startling theories are presented to the
            reader, they must be prefaced by a few words of explanation. This
            is absolutely necessary, as these theories clash not only with
            Modern Science, but, on certain points, contradict earlier
            statements<a href="#note_264" id="noteref_264" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a>
            made by other Theosophists, who claim to base their explanations
            and renderings of these teachings on the same authority as we
            do.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This may give
            rise to the idea that there is a decided contradiction between
            the expounders of the same doctrine; whereas the difference, in
            reality, arises from the incompleteness of the information given
            to earlier writers, who thus drew some erroneous conclusions and
            indulged in premature speculations, in their endeavour to present
            a complete system to the public. Thus the reader, who is already
            a student of Theosophy, must not be surprised to find in these
            pages the rectification of certain statements made in various
            Theosophical works, and also the explanation of certain points
            which have remained obscure, because they were necessarily left
            incomplete. Many are the questions upon which even the author of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>, the best
            and most accurate of all such works, has not touched. On the
            other hand, even he has introduced several mistaken notions,
            which must now be presented in their true mystic light, as far as
            the present writer is capable of so doing.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us then
            make a short break between the Shlokas just explained and those
            which follow, for the cosmic periods which separate them are of
            immense duration. This will afford us ample time to take a
            bird's-eye view of some points pertaining to the Secret Doctrine,
            which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg

              Few Early Misconceptions Concerning Planets, Rounds, And
              Man.</h4>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
              eleven Stanzas omitted, there is one which gives a full
              description of the formation of the Planetary Chains one after
              another, after the first cosmic and atomic differentiation had
              commenced in the primitive Acosmism. It is idle to speak of
              <span class="tei tei-q">“laws arising when Deity prepares to
              create,”</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">“laws,”</span> or
              rather Law, are eternal and uncreated; and again Deity is Law,
              and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versà</span></span>. Moreover, the
              one eternal Law unfolds everything in the (to be) manifested
              Nature on a sevenfold principle; among the rest, the countless
              circular Chains of Worlds, composed of seven Globes, graduated
              on the four lower planes of the World of Formation, the three
              others belonging to the Archetypal Universe. Out of these seven
              only one, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the lowest and the most material of these
              Globes</span></span>, is within our plane or means of
              perception, the six others lying outside it and being therefore
              invisible to the terrestrial eye. Every such Chain of Worlds is
              the progeny and creation of another, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead</span></em> Chain—its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reïncarnation</span></em>, so to say. To
              make it clearer: we are told that each of the planets—of which
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven
              only</span></em> were called sacred, as being ruled by the
              highest Regents or Gods, and not at all because the Ancients
              knew nothing of the others<a href="#note_265" id="noteref_265" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">265</span></span></a>—whether
              known or unknown, is a septenary, as also is the Chain to which
              the Earth belongs. For instance, all such planets as Mercury,
              Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc., etc., or our Earth, are as
              visible to us as our Globe, probably, is to the inhabitants, if
              any, of the other planets, because they are all on the same
              plane; while the superior fellow-globes of these planets are on
              other planes quite outside that of our terrestrial senses. As
              their relative positions are given further on, and also in the
              diagram appended to the comments on Shloka 6 of Stanza VI, a
              few words of explanation is all that is needed at present.
              These invisible companions correspond curiously to that which
              we call the <span class="tei tei-q">“principles”</span> in man.
              The seven are on three material planes and one spiritual plane,
              answering to the three Upâdhis (Material Bases), and one
              spiritual Vehicle (Vâhana), of our seven Principles in the
              human division. If, for the sake of a clearer mental
              conception, we imagine <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg177"></a> the human Principles to be arranged as in
              the following scheme, we shall obtain the following diagram of
              correspondences:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we are
              proceeding here from Universals to Particulars, instead of
              using the inductive or Aristotelean method, the numbers are
              reversed. Spirit is enumerated the first instead of seventh, as
              is usually done, but in truth, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought not to be
              done</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Principles, as usually named after the manner of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span> and other works, are: 1, Âtmâ; 2, Buddhi
              (Spiritual Soul); 3, Manas (Human Soul); 4, Kâma Rûpa (Vehicle
              of Desires and Passions); 5, Prâna; 6, Linga Sharîra; 7, Sthûla
              Sharîra.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The dark
              horizontal lines of the lower planes are the Upâdhis in the
              case of the human Principles, and the planes in the case of the
              Planetary Chain. Of course, as regards the Human Principles,
              the diagram does not place them quite in order, yet it shows
              the correspondence and analogy to which attention is now drawn.
              As the reader will see, it is a case of descent into matter,
              the adjustment—in both the mystic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg178"></a> and the physical sense—of the two, and
              their interblending for the great coming <span class="tei tei-q">“struggle for life”</span> that awaits both
              Entities. <span class="tei tei-q">“Entity”</span> may be
              thought a strange term to use in the case of a Globe, but the
              ancient philosophers, who saw in the Earth a huge <span class="tei tei-q">“animal,”</span> were wiser in their generation
              than our modern geologists are in theirs; and Pliny, who called
              the Earth our kind nurse and mother, the only Element which is
              not inimical to man, spoke more truly than Watts, who fancied
              that he saw in her the footstool of God. For Earth is only the
              footstool of man in his ascension to higher regions; the
              vestibule—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having
              learned thus much, the Mystic will be better prepared to
              understand the Occult teaching, though every formal student of
              Modern Science may, and probably will, regard it as
              preposterous nonsense. The student of Occultism, however, holds
              that the theory at present under discussion is far more
              philosophical and probable than any other. It is more logical,
              at any rate, than the theory recently advanced which made of
              the Moon the projection of a portion of our Earth, extruded
              when the latter was a globe in fusion, a molten plastic
              mass.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is said,
              moreover, that the Planetary Chains having their Days and their
              Nights—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, periods of activity or
              life, and of inertia or death—behave in heaven as do men on
              earth: they generate their likes, grow old, and become
              personally extinct, their spiritual principles only living in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without
              attempting the very difficult task of giving out the whole
              process in all its cosmic details, enough may be said to give
              an approximate idea of it. When a Planetary Chain is in its
              last Round, its Globe A, before finally <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dying
              out</span></em>, sends all its energy and principles into a
              neutral centre of latent force, a laya centre, and thereby
              informs a new nucleus of undifferentiated substance or matter,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, calls it into activity
              or gives it life. Suppose such a process to have taken place in
              the Lunar Planetary Chain; suppose again, for argument's
              sake—though Mr. Darwin's theory quoted below has lately been
              upset, even if the fact has not yet been ascertained by
              mathematical calculation—that the Moon is far older than the
              Earth. Imagine the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six</span></em> fellow-globes of the
              Moon—æons before the first Globe of our seven was evolved—just
              in the same position in relation to each other as the
              fellow-globes of our Chain now occupy in regard to our
              Earth.<a href="#note_267" id="noteref_267" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a>
              And now it will be easy to imagine further Globe A of the Lunar
              Chain informing Globe A of the Terrestrial Chain, and—dying;
              next Globe B of the former sending its energy into Globe B of
              the new Chain; then Globe C of the Lunar creating its progeny
              Sphere C of the Terrene Chain; then the Moon (our satellite)
              pouring forth into the lowest Globe of our Planetary
              Chain—Globe D, our Earth—all its life, energy and powers; and,
              having transferred them to a new centre, becoming virtually a
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead
              planet</span></em>, in which since the birth of our Globe
              rotation has almost ceased. The Moon is the satellite of our
              Earth, undeniably, but this does not invalidate the theory that
              she has given to the Earth all but her corpse. For Darwin's
              theory to hold good, besides the hypothesis just upset, other
              still more incongruous speculations had to be invented. The
              Moon, it is said, has cooled nearly six times as rapidly as the
              Earth.<a href="#note_268" id="noteref_268" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The Moon, if the earth is 14,000,000
              years old since its incrustation, is only eleven and two-thirds
              millions of years old since that stage ...”</span> etc. And if
              our Moon is but a splash from our Earth, why can no similar
              inference be established for the Moons of other planets? The
              Astronomers <span class="tei tei-q">“do not know.”</span> Why
              should Venus and Mercury have no satellites, and by what, when
              they exist, were they formed? The Astronomers do not know,
              because, we say, Science has only one key—the key of matter—to
              open the mysteries of Nature, while Occult Philosophy has seven
              keys and explains that which Science fails to see. Mercury and
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg180"></a> Venus have no
              satellites, but they had <span class="tei tei-q">“parents”</span> just as the Earth had. Both are
              far older than the Earth, and, before the latter reaches her
              Seventh Round, her mother Moon will have dissolved into thin
              air, as the Moons of the other planets have, or have not, as
              the case may be, since there are planets which have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">several</span></em> Moons—a mystery again

              revenges herself on it, by soaking it through and through with
              the nefarious, invisible and poisoned influence which emanates
              from the occult side of her nature. For she is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead</span></em>, yet a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living
              body</span></em>. The particles of her decaying corpse are full
              of active and destructive life, although the body which they
              had formed, is soulless and lifeless. Therefore its emanations
              are at the same time beneficent and maleficent—a circumstance
              finding its parallel on earth, in the fact that the grass and
              plants are nowhere more juicy and thriving than on graves;
              while at the same time it is the graveyard, or
              corpse-emanations, which kill. And like all ghouls or vampires,
              the Moon is the friend of the sorcerers and the foe of the
              unwary. From the archaic æons and the later times of the
              witches of Thessaly, down to some of the present Tântrikas of
              Bengal, her nature and properties have been known to every
              Occultist, but have remained a closed book for Physicists.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
              Moon from the astronomical, geological, and physical
              standpoints. As to her metaphysical and psychic nature, it must
              remain an occult secret in this work, as it was in the volume
              entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>,
              notwithstanding the rather sanguine statement made therein,
              that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is not much mystery left
              now in the riddle of the eighth sphere.”</span><a href="#note_269" id="noteref_269" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a>
              These are topics, indeed, <span class="tei tei-q">“on which the
              Adepts are very reserved in their communications to uninitiated
              pupils,”</span> and since they have, moreover, never sanctioned
              or permitted any published speculations upon them, the less
              said the better.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, without
              treading upon the forbidden ground of the <span class="tei tei-q">“eighth sphere,”</span> it may be useful to state
              some additional facts with regard to the ex-monads of the Lunar
              Chain—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lunar Ancestors”</span>—as
              they play a leading part in the coming Anthropogenesis. This
              brings us <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg
              181]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg181"></a> directly to the Septenary Constitution of
              man; and as some discussion has arisen of late about the best
              classification to be adopted for the division of the
              microcosmic entity, two systems are now appended with a view to
              facilitate comparison. The subjoined short article is from the
              pen of Mr. T. Subba Row, a learned Vedântin scholar. He prefers
              the Brâhmanical division of the Râja Yoga, and from a
              metaphysical point of view he is quite right. But, as it is a
              question of simple choice and expediency, we hold in this work
              to the time-honoured classification of the Trans-Himâlayan
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Arhat Esoteric School.”</span> The

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
              foregoing table it will be seen that the third principle in the
              Buddhist classification is not separately mentioned in the
              Vedântic division, as it is merely the vehicle of Prâna. It
              will also be seen that the fourth principle is included in the
              third Kosha (Sheath), as the same principle is but the vehicle
              of will-power, which is but an energy of the mind. It must also
              be noticed that the Vijñânamayakosha is considered to be
              distinct from the Mânomayakosha, as a division is made
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg182"></a> after death
              between the lower part of the mind, as it were, which has a
              closer affinity with the fourth principle than with the sixth
              and its higher part, which attaches itself to the latter, and
              which is, in fact, the basis for the higher spiritual
              individuality of man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may also
              here point out to our readers that the classification mentioned
              in the last column is, for all practical purposes, connected
              with Râja Yoga, the best and simplest. Though there are seven
              principles in man, there are but three distinct Upâdhis
              (Bases), in each of which his Âtmâ may work independently of
              the rest. These three Upâdhis can be separated by an Adept
              without killing himself. He cannot separate the seven
              principles from each other without destroying his
              constitution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The student
              will now be better prepared to see that between the three
              Upâdhis of the Râja Yoga and its Atmâ, and our three Upâdhis,
              Âtmâ, and the additional three divisions, there is in reality
              but very little difference. Moreover, as every Adept in
              Cis-Himâlayan or Trans-Himâlayan India, of the Patanjali, the
              Âryâsanga or the Mahâyâna schools, has to become a Râja Yogî,
              he must, therefore, accept the Târaka Râja classification in
              principle and theory, whatever classification he resorts to for
              practical and Occult purposes. Thus, it matters very little
              whether one speaks of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> Upâdhis, with their
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em> Aspects, and Âtmâ, the
              eternal and immortal synthesis, or calls them the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Principles.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the
              benefit of those who may not have read, or, if they have, may
              not have clearly understood, in Theosophical writings, the
              doctrine of the septenary Chains of Worlds in the Solar Cosmos,
              the teaching is briefly as follows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1.
              Everything in the metaphysical as in the physical Universe is
              septenary. Hence every sidereal body, every planet, whether
              visible or invisible, is credited with six companion Globes.
              The evolution of life proceeds on these seven Globes or bodies,
              from the First to the Seventh, in Seven Rounds or Seven
              Cycles.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. These
              Globes are formed by a process which the Occultists call the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“rebirth of Planetary Chains (or
              Rings).”</span> When the Seventh and last Round of one of such
              Rings has been entered upon, the highest or first Globe, A,
              followed by all the others down to the last, instead of
              entering upon a certain time of rest—or <span class="tei tei-q">“Obscuration,”</span> as in the previous
              Rounds—begins to die out. The Planetary Dissolution (Pralaya)
              is at hand, and its hour has struck; each Globe has to transfer
              its life and energy to another planet.<a href="#note_276" id="noteref_276" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg183"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. Our
              Earth, as the visible representative of its invisible superior
              fellow-globes, its <span class="tei tei-q">“Lords”</span> or
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Principles,”</span> has to live, as
              have the others, through seven Rounds. During the first three,
              it forms and consolidates; during the fourth, it settles and
              hardens; during the last three, it gradually returns to its
              first ethereal form: it is spiritualized, so to say.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. Its
              Humanity develops fully only in the Fourth—our present Round.
              Up to this Fourth Life-Cycle, it is referred to as <span class="tei tei-q">“Humanity”</span> only for lack of a more
              appropriate term. Like the grub which becomes chrysalis and
              butterfly, Man, or rather that which becomes Man, passes
              through all the forms and kingdoms during the First Round, and
              through all the human shapes during the two following Rounds.
              Arrived on our Earth at the commencement of the Fourth, in the
              present series of Life-Cycles and Races, Man is the first form
              that appears thereon, being preceded only by the mineral and
              vegetable kingdoms—even the latter having to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">develop and
              continue</span></em> its further evolution <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through
              man</span></em>. This will be explained in Volume II. During
              the three Rounds to come, Humanity, like the Globe on which it
              lives, will be ever tending to reässume its primeval form, that
              of a Dhyân Chohanic Host. Man tends to become <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>
              God and then—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></em>, like every other Atom in
              the Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beginning so
              early as with the Second Round, Evolution proceeds already on
              quite a different plan. It is only during the first Round that
              (Heavenly) Man becomes a human being on Globe A, (rebecomes) a
              mineral, a plant, an animal, on Globe B and C, etc. The process
              changes entirely from the Second Round; but you have learned
              prudence ... and I advise you to say nothing before the time
              for saying it has come....</span></span><a href="#note_277" id="noteref_277" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. Every
              Life-Cycle on Globe D (our Earth)<a href="#note_278" id="noteref_278" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a>
              is composed of seven Root-Races. They commence with the
              ethereal and end with the spiritual, on the double line of
              physical and moral evolution—from the beginning of the
              Terrestrial Round to its close. One is a <span class="tei tei-q">“Planetary Round”</span> from Globe A to Globe G,
              the seventh; the other, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Globe
              Round,”</span> or the Terrestrial.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is very
              well described in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>, and needs
              no further elucidation for the time being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. The First
              Root-Race, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the first <span class="tei tei-q">“Men”</span> on earth (irrespective of form), were
              the progeny of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Celestial
              Men,”</span> rightly called in Indian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg184"></a> philosophy the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lunar Ancestors”</span> or the Pitris, of which
              there are seven Classes or Hierarchies. As all this will be
              sufficiently explained in the following sections and in Volume
              II, no more need be said of it here.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the two
              works already mentioned, both of which treat of subjects from
              the Occult doctrine, need particular notice. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span> is too well known in Theosophical
              circles, and even to the outside world, for it to be necessary
              to enter at length upon its merits here. It is an excellent
              book, and has done still more excellent work. But this does not
              alter the fact that it contains some mistaken notions, and that
              it has led many Theosophists and lay-readers to form an
              erroneous conception of the Eastern Secret Doctrine. Moreover
              it seems, perhaps, a little too materialistic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Man</span></span>, which came later, was
              an attempt to present the archaic doctrine from a more ideal
              standpoint, to translate some visions in and from the Astral
              Light, to render some teachings partly gathered from a Master's
              thoughts, but unfortunately misunderstood. This work also
              speaks of the evolution of the early Races of men on Earth, and
              contains some excellent pages of a philosophical character. But
              so far it is only an interesting little mystical romance. It
              has failed in its mission, because the conditions required for
              a correct translation of these visions were not present. Hence
              the reader must not wonder if our volumes contradict these
              earlier descriptions in several particulars.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Esoteric
              cosmogony in general, and the evolution of the human Monad
              especially, differ so essentially in these two books, and in
              other Theosophical works written independently by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beginners</span></em>, that it becomes
              impossible to proceed with the present work without special
              mention of these two earlier volumes, for both have a number of
              admirers—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>
              especially. The time has arrived for the explanation of some
              matters in this direction. Mistakes have now to be checked by
              the original teachings, and corrected. If one of the said works
              has too pronounced a bias toward materialistic Science, the
              other is decidedly too idealistic, and at times is
              fantastic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
              doctrine—rather incomprehensible to Western minds—which deals
              with the periodical Obscurations and successive Rounds of the
              Globes, along their circular Chains, were born the first
              perplexities and misconceptions. One of such has reference to
              the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fifth-”</span> and even
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Sixth-Rounders.”</span> Those who knew
              that a Round was preceded <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg185"></a> and followed by a long Pralaya, a pause
              of rest, which created an impassable gulf between two Rounds
              until the time came for a renewed cycle of life, could not
              understand the <span class="tei tei-q">“fallacy”</span> of
              talking about <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fifth</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sixth</span></em>-Rounders”</span> in our
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourth</span></em> Round. Gautama Buddha,
              it was held, was a <span class="tei tei-q">“Sixth-Rounder,”</span> Plato and some other great
              philosophers and minds, <span class="tei tei-q">“Fifth-Rounders.”</span> How could it be? One
              Master taught and affirmed that there were such <span class="tei tei-q">“Fifth-Rounders”</span> even now on Earth; and
              though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">understood to say</span></em> that mankind
              was yet in the Fourth Round, in another place he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seemed</span></em> to say that we were in
              the Fifth. To this an <span class="tei tei-q">“apocalyptic
              answer”</span> was returned by another Teacher: <span class="tei tei-q">“A few drops of rain do not make a monsoon, though
              they presage it.”</span>... <span class="tei tei-q">“No, we are
              not in the Fifth Round, but Fifth Round men have been coming in
              for the last few thousand years.”</span> This was worse than
              the riddle of the Sphinx! Students of Occultism subjected their
              brains to the wildest work of speculation. For a considerable
              time they tried to outvie Œdipus and reconcile the two
              statements. And as the Masters kept as silent as the stony
              Sphinx herself, they were accused of <span class="tei tei-q">“inconsistency,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“contradiction,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“discrepancies.”</span> But they were simply
              allowing the speculations to go on, in order <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to teach a
              lesson</span></em> which the Western mind sorely needs. In
              their conceit and arrogance, and in their habit of
              materializing every metaphysical conception and term, without
              allowing any margin for Eastern metaphor and allegory, the
              Orientalists had made a jumble of the Hindû exoteric
              philosophy, and the Theosophists were now doing the same with
              regard to Esoteric teachings. To this day it is evident that
              the latter have utterly failed to understand the meaning of the
              term <span class="tei tei-q">“Fifth and Sixth-Rounders.”</span>
              But it is simply this: every Round brings about a new
              development, and even an entire change, in the mental, psychic,
              spiritual and physical constitution of man; all these
              principles evolving on an ever ascending scale. Hence it
              follows that those persons who, like Confucius and Plato,
              belonged psychically, mentally and spiritually to the higher
              planes of evolution, were in our Fourth Round as the average
              man will be in the Fifth Round, whose mankind is destined to
              find itself, on this scale of evolution, immensely higher than
              is our present humanity. Similarly, Gautama Buddha—Wisdom
              incarnate—was still higher and greater than all the men we have
              mentioned who are called <span class="tei tei-q">“Fifth-Rounders,”</span> and so Buddha and
              Shankarâchârya are termed <span class="tei tei-q">“Sixth
              Rounders,”</span> allegorically. Hence again the concealed
              wisdom of the remark, pronounced at the time <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg186"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“evasive”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“a few
              drops of rain do not make a monsoon, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">though they

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span style="font-size: 90%">It is impossible,</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">when the complicated
                facts of an entirely unfamiliar science are being presented

                broad rules first and deal with the exceptions afterwards,
                and especially is this the case with a study, in connection
                with which</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">the traditional methods
                of teaching, generally followed, aim at impressing every

                last relieves</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the
              author of the remark was himself, as he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“an untrained mind”</span> in Occultism, his own
              inferences, and his better knowledge of modern astronomical
              speculations than of archaic doctrines, led him, quite
              naturally, and unconsciously to himself, to commit a few
              mistakes of detail rather than of any <span class="tei tei-q">“broad rule.”</span> One such will now be noticed.
              It is a trifling one, still it is calculated to lead many a
              beginner into erroneous conceptions. But as the mistaken
              notions of the earlier editions were corrected in the
              annotations of the fifth edition, so the sixth may be revised
              and perfected. There were several reasons for such mistakes.
              They were due to the necessity, under which the Teachers
              laboured, of giving what were considered as <span class="tei tei-q">“evasive answers”</span>; the questions being too
              persistently pressed to be left unnoticed, while, on the other
              hand, they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could only be partially
              answered</span></em>. This position notwithstanding, the
              confession that <span class="tei tei-q">“half a loaf is better
              than no bread”</span> was but too often misunderstood, and
              hardly appreciated as it ought to have been. As a result
              thereof gratuitous speculations were sometimes indulged in by
              the European lay-chelâs. Among such were the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery of the Eighth Sphere”</span> in its
              relation to the Moon, and the erroneous statement that two of
              the superior Globes of the Terrestrial Chain were two of our
              well-known planets; <span class="tei tei-q">“besides the earth
              ... there are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">only two other worlds of our chain which
              are visible</span></span> ... Mars and
              Mercury....”</span><a href="#note_279" id="noteref_279" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was a
              great mistake. But the blame for it is to be attached as much
              to the vagueness and incompleteness of the Master's answer as
              to the question of the learner itself, which was equally vague
              and indefinite.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was
              asked: <span class="tei tei-q">“What planets, of those known to
              ordinary Science, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg
              187]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg187"></a> besides Mercury, belong to our system of
              worlds?”</span> Now if by <span class="tei tei-q">“system of
              worlds”</span> our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Terrestrial Chain</span></span>, or
              <span class="tei tei-q">“String,”</span> was intended, in the
              mind of the querist, instead of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Solar System of Worlds,”</span> as it should have
              been, then of course the answer was likely to have been
              misunderstood. For the reply was: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mars, etc., and, four other planets of
              which Astronomy knows nothing. Neither A, B, nor Y, Z, are
              known, nor can they be seen through physical means, however
              perfected</span></span>.”</span> This is plain: (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>)
              Astronomy as yet knows nothing in reality of the planets,
              neither the ancient ones, nor those discovered in modern times.
              (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) No <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">companion</span></em> planets from A to Z,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, no upper Globes of any
              Chain in the Solar System, can be seen; with the exception of
              course of all the planets which come <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth</span></em> in number, as our
              Earth, the Moon, etc., etc. As to Mars, Mercury, and
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the four other planets,”</span> they
              bear a relation to Earth of which no Master or high Occultist
              will ever speak, much less explain the nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this same
              letter the impossibility is distinctly stated by one of the
              Teachers to the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Try to understand that you are putting me
              questions pertaining to the highest Initiation; that I can give
              you (only) a general view, but that I dare not, nor will I,
              enter into details</span></span>....”</span> Copies of all the
              letters ever received, or sent, with the exception of a few
              private ones—<span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in which there
              was no teaching</span></em>,”</span> the Master says—are with
              the writer. As it was her duty, in the beginning, to answer and
              explain certain points not touched upon, it is more than likely
              that, notwithstanding the many annotations on these copies, the
              writer, in her ignorance of English and her fear of saying too
              much, may have bungled the information given. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">She takes the
              whole blame for it upon herself in any and every
              case</span></span>. But it is impossible for her to allow
              students to remain any longer under erroneous impressions, or
              to believe that the fault lies with the Esoteric system.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let it then
              be now distinctly stated that the theory broached is
              impossible, with or without the additional evidence furnished
              by modern Astronomy. Physical Science can supply corroborative,
              though still very uncertain, evidence, but only as regards
              heavenly bodies on the same plane of materiality as our
              objective Universe. Mars and Mercury, Venus and Jupiter, like
              every hitherto discovered planet, or those still to be
              discovered, are all, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>, the representatives
              on our plane of such Chains. As distinctly stated in one of the
              numerous letters of Mr. Sinnett's Teacher: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">there are other and innumerable</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg188"></a><span style="font-style: italic">manvantaric Chains of Globes which bear
              intelligent Beings, both in and outside our Solar
              System</span></span>.”</span> But neither Mars nor Mercury
              belong to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> Chain. They are, along
              with other planets, septenary Units in the great host of Chains
              of our System, and all are as visible as their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">upper</span></span> Globes are
              invisible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If it is
              still argued that certain expressions in the Teacher's letters
              were liable to mislead, the answer comes: Amen; so they were.
              The author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span> understood
              it well when he wrote that such are <span class="tei tei-q">“the traditional modes of teaching ... by provoking
              the perplexity,”</span> they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em>
              or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do
              not relieve</span></em>—as the case may be. At all events, if
              it is urged that this might have been explained earlier, and
              the true nature of the planets given out as they now are, the
              answer comes that: It was not found expedient to do so at the
              time, as it would have opened the way to a series of additional
              questions <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">which could never be answered on account
              of their Esoteric nature</span></span>, and thus would only
              become embarrassing. It had been declared from the first, and
              has been repeatedly asserted since: (1) That no Theosophist,
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not
              even as an accepted Chelâ</span></span>, let alone lay
              students, could expect to have the secret teachings explained
              to him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thoroughly and completely</span></em>,
              before <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">he had irretrievably pledged himself to
              the Brotherhood and passed through at least one
              Initiation</span></span>, because no figures and numbers could
              be given to the public, for figures and numbers are the key to
              the Esoteric system. (2) That what was revealed was merely the
              Esoteric lining of that which is contained in almost all the
              exoteric scriptures of the world-religions—preëminently in the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span> and the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span> of the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, and even in the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>. It was a small
              portion of what is divulged far more fully now in the present
              volumes; and even this is very incomplete and fragmentary.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
              present work was commenced, the writer, feeling sure that the
              speculation about Mars and Mercury was a mistake, applied to
              the Teachers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by letter</span></em> for an explanation
              and an authoritative version. Both came in due time, and
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbatim</span></em> extracts from these
              are now given.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“... <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">It is quite correct that Mars is in a
              state of obscuration at present, and Mercury just beginning to
              get out of it. You might add that Venus is in her last
              Round.... If neither Mercury nor Venus have satellites, it is
              because of the reasons ... and also because Mars has two
              satellites to which he has no right.... Phobos, the

              this remark of long ago by Laplace and now by Faye do not
              agree, you see. (Read</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">Comptes Rendus,</span><span style="font-style: italic">’</span></span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg189"></a><span style="font-style: italic">Tome XC,

              there</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">must exist some defect in the mother idea
              of the theory,</span><span style="font-style: italic">’</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">as Faye justly observes.... Again, both
              [Mars and Mercury] are septenary Chains, as independent of the
              Earth's sidereal lords and superiors as you are independent of
              the</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">principles</span><span style="font-style: italic">’</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">of Däumling [Tom Thumb]—which were perhaps

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here are
              more extracts from another letter written by the same
              authority. This time it is in answer to some objections laid
              before the Teachers. They are based upon extremely scientific,
              and as futile, reasonings about the advisability of trying to
              reconcile the Esoteric theories with the speculations of Modern
              Science, were written by a young Theosophist as a warning
              against the <span class="tei tei-q">“Secret Doctrine,”</span>
              and in reference to the same subject. He had declared that if
              there were such companion Earths, <span class="tei tei-q">“they
              must be only a wee bit less material than our globe.”</span>
              How then was it that they could not be seen? The answer
              was:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“... <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Were psychic and spiritual teachings more
              fully understood, it would become next to impossible to even
              imagine such an incongruity. Unless less trouble is taken to
              reconcile the irreconcilable—that is to say, the metaphysical
              and spiritual sciences with physical or natural
              philosophy,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">natural</span><span style="font-style: italic">’</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">being a synonym to them [men of Science]

              corporeal senses—no progress can be really achieved. Our Globe,
              as taught from the first, is at the bottom of the arc of
              descent, where the matter of our perceptions exhibits itself in
              its grossest form.... Hence it only stands to reason that the
              Globes which overshadow our Earth, must be on different and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It thus
              becomes patent why we could not perceive, even with the help of

              Those alone, whom we call Adepts, who know how to direct their
              mental vision and to transfer their consciousness—both physical
              and psychic—to other planes of being, are able to speak with
              authority on such subjects. And they tell us plainly:</p>

              Meanwhile, be prudent. Do not give out the great Truths that
              are the inheritance of the future Races, to our present
              generation. Do not attempt to unveil the secret of Being and
              Non-Being to those unable to see the hidden meaning of Apollo's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
              early letters, in which terms had to be invented and words
              coined, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Rings”</span> very often
              became <span class="tei tei-q">“Rounds,”</span> and the

              <span class="tei tei-q">“Round”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“World-Ring,”</span> the Teacher wrote:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I believe this will lead to a further
              confusion. A Round we are agreed to call the passage of a Monad

              further</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              Notwithstanding this agreement, many mistakes, owing to this
              confusion, crept into the earliest teachings. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Races”</span> even were occasionally mixed up with
              the <span class="tei tei-q">“Rounds”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Rings,”</span> and led to similar mistakes in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Man:
              Fragments of Forgotten Truth</span></span>. From the first the
              Master had written:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Not being permitted to give you the whole
              truth, or divulge the number of isolated fractions, ... I am
              unable to satisfy you</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This in
              answer to the questions: <span class="tei tei-q">“If we are
              right, then the total existence prior to the man-period is
              637,”</span> etc., etc. To all the queries relating to figures,
              the reply was: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Try to solve the
              problem of 777 incarnations.... Though I am obliged to withhold
              information, ... yet if you should work out the problem by
              yourself, it will be my duty to tell you
              so</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it never
              was so worked out, and the results were—never-ceasing
              perplexity and mistakes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even the
              teaching about the septenary constitution of the sidereal
              bodies and of the macrocosm—from which the septenary division
              of the microcosm, or man—has until now been among the most
              esoteric. In olden times it used to be divulged only at
              Initiation together with the most sacred figures of the cycles.
              Now, as stated in one of the Theosophical journals,<a href="#note_280" id="noteref_280" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a>
              the revelation of the whole system of cosmogony had not been
              contemplated, nor even thought for one moment possible,
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg192"></a> at a time when a
              few scraps of information were sparingly given out, in answer
              to letters, written by the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span>, in which he put forward a multiplicity
              of questions. Among these were questions on such problems
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
              no</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Master</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">however high and
              independent he might be, would have the right to answer, and
              thus divulge to the world the most time-honoured and archaic of
              the mysteries of the ancient college-temples</span></span>.
              Hence only a few of the doctrines were revealed in their broad
              outlines, while details were constantly withheld, and all the
              efforts made to elicit more information about them were
              systematically eluded from the beginning. This was perfectly
              natural. Of the four Vidyâs, out of the seven branches of
              Knowledge mentioned in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>—namely,
              Yajna Vidyâ, the performance of religious rites in order to
              produce certain results; Mahâ Vidyâ, the great (magic)
              knowledge, now degenerated into Tântrika worship; Guhya Vidyâ,
              the science of Mantras and their true rhythm or chanting, of
              mystical incantations, etc.; Âtmâ Vidyâ, or the true <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine
              Wisdom</span></em>—it is only the last which can throw final
              and absolute light upon the teachings of the three first named.
              Without the help of Âtmâ Vidyâ, the other three remain no
              better than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">surface</span></em> sciences, geometrical
              magnitudes having length and breadth, but no thickness. They
              are like the soul, limbs and mind of a sleeping man, capable of
              mechanical motions, of chaotic dreams and even sleep-walking,
              of producing visible effects, but stimulated only by
              instinctual not intellectual causes, least of all by fully
              conscious spiritual impulses. A good deal can be given out and
              explained from the three first-named sciences. But unless the
              key to their teachings is furnished by Âtmâ Vidyâ, they will
              remain for ever like the fragments of a mangled text-book, like
              the adumbrations of great truths, dimly perceived by the most
              spiritual, but distorted out of all proportion by those who
              would nail every shadow to the wall.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, again,
              another great perplexity was created in the minds of students
              by the incomplete exposition of the doctrine of the evolution
              of the Monads. To be fully realized, both this process and that
              of the birth of the Globes must be examined far more from their
              metaphysical aspect, than from what one might call a
              statistical standpoint, involving figures and numbers which are
              rarely permitted to be widely used. Unfortunately, there are
              few who are inclined to handle these doctrines only
              metaphysically. Even the best of the Western writers upon our
              doctrine declares in his work, when speaking of the evolution
              of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg
              193]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg193"></a> Monads, that <span class="tei tei-q">“on
              pure metaphysics of that sort we are not now
              engaged.”</span><a href="#note_281" id="noteref_281" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a>
              And in such case, as the Teacher remarks in a letter to him:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Why this preaching of our doctrines, all
              this uphill work and swimming</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">in adversum flumen</span><span style="font-style: italic">’</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">? Why should the West ... learn ... from
              the East ... that which can never meet the requirements of the
              special tastes of the æsthetics?</span></span>”</span> And he
              draws his correspondent's attention <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">to the formidable difficulties encountered
              by us [the Adepts] in every attempt we make to explain our
              metaphysics to the Western mind.</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And well he
              may; for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outside</span></em> of metaphysics, no
              Occult philosophy, no Esotericism is possible. It is like
              trying to explain the aspirations and affections, love and
              hatred, the most private and sacred workings in the soul and
              mind of a living man, by an anatomical description of the
              thorax and brain of his dead body.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now
              examine two tenets mentioned above, but hardly alluded to in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>, and
              supplement them as far as lies in our power.</p>

              Additional Facts And Explanations Concerning The Globes And The
              Monads.</h4>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two
              statements made in the above work must be noticed and the
              author's opinions quoted. The first is as follows:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span style="font-size: 90%">The spiritual Monads ... do not
                fully complete their mineral existence on Globe A, then
                complete it on Globe B, and so on. They pass several times
                round the whole circle as minerals, and then again several
                times round as vegetables, and several times as animals. We
                purposely refrain for the present from going into figures,
                etc., etc.</span><a href="#note_282" id="noteref_282" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That was a
              wise course to adopt in view of the great secrecy maintained
              with regard to figures and numbers. This reticence is now
              partially relinquished; but it would perhaps have been better
              had the real numbers concerning Rounds and evolutional
              gyrations been either entirely divulged at the time, or
              entirely withheld. Mr. Sinnett understood this difficulty well
              when saying:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em">
<span style="font-size: 90%">For reasons which are not easy
                for the outsider to divine, the possessors of Occult
                knowledge are especially reluctant to give out numerical
                facts relating to cosmogony, though it is hard for the
                uninitiated to understand why they should be
                withheld.</span><a href="#note_283" id="noteref_283" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a></p>
</div><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg
              194]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg194"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That there
              were such reasons is evident. Nevertheless, it is to this
              reticence that most of the confused ideas of some Eastern as
              well as Western pupils are due. The difficulties in the way of
              the acceptance of the particular tenets under consideration
              seemed great, just because of the absence of any data to go
              upon. But there it was. For, as the Masters have many times
              declared, the figures belonging to the Occult calculations
              cannot be given—outside the circle of pledged Chelâs, and not
              even these can break the rules.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To make
              things plainer, without touching upon the mathematical aspects
              of the doctrine, the teaching given may be expanded and some
              obscure points solved. As the evolution of the Globes and that
              of the Monads are so closely interblended, we will make of the
              two teachings one. In reference to the Monads, the reader is
              asked to bear in mind that Eastern philosophy rejects the
              Western theological dogma of a newly-created soul for every
              baby born, a dogma as unphilosophical as it is impossible in
              the economy of Nature. There must be a limited number of
              Monads, evolving and growing more and more perfect, through
              their assimilation of many successive Personalities, in every
              new Manvantara. This is absolutely necessary in view of the
              doctrines of Rebirth and Karma, and of the gradual return of
              the human Monad to its source—Absolute Deity. Thus, although
              the hosts of more or less progressed Monads are almost
              incalculable, they are still finite, as is everything in this
              Universe of differentiation and finiteness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As shown in
              the double diagram of the human Principles and the ascending
              Globes of the World-Chains,<a href="#note_284" id="noteref_284" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>
              there is an eternal concatenation of causes and effects, and a
              perfect analogy which runs through, and links together, all the
              lines of evolution. One begets the other—Globes as
              Personalities. But, let us begin at the beginning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
              outline of the process by which the successive Planetary Chains
              are formed has just been given. To prevent future
              misconceptions, some further details may be offered which will
              also throw light on the history of Humanity on our own Chain,
              the progeny of that of the Moon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
              accompanying diagram, Fig. 1 represents the Lunar Chain of
              seven Globes at the outset of its seventh or last Round; while
              Fig. 2 represents the Earth Chain which will be, but is not yet
              in existence. The seven Globes of each Chain are distinguished
              in their cyclic order <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
              195]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg195"></a> by the letters A to G, the Globes of the
              Earth Chain being further marked by a cross, the symbol of the
              Earth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"></p>
<div class="tei tei-figure" style="width: 70%; text-align: center">
<a href="images/diagram-ii.png" id="id-6013516430624237832"><img alt="Diagram II" src="images/diagram-ii.png" id="img_images_diagram-ii.png"></a>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, it must
              be remembered that the Monads cycling round any septenary Chain
              are divided into seven Classes or Hierarchies, according to
              their respective stages of evolution, consciousness and merit.
              Let us follow, then, the order of their appearance on Globe A,
              in the First Round. The time-spaces between the appearances of
              these Hierarchies on any one Globe are so adjusted, that when
              Class 7, the last, appears on Globe A, Class 1, the first, has
              just passed on to Globe B; and so on, step by step, all round
              the Chain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, in
              the Seventh Round of the Lunar Chain, when Class 7, the last,
              quits Globe A, that Globe, instead of falling asleep, as it had
              done in previous Rounds, begins to die (to go into its
              Planetary Pralaya);<a href="#note_285" id="noteref_285" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>
              and in dying it transfers successively, as just said, its
              principles, or life-elements and energy, etc., one after the
              other, to a new laya-centre, which commences the formation of
              Globe A of the Earth Chain. A similar process takes place for
              each of the Globes of the Lunar Chain, one after the other,
              each forming a fresh Globe of the Earth Chain. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg196"></a> Our Moon was the fourth
              Globe of the series, and was on the same plane of perception as
              our Earth. But Globe A of the Lunar Chain is not fully
              <span class="tei tei-q">“dead,”</span> till the first Monads of
              the first Class have passed from Globe G or Z, the last of the
              Lunar Chain, into the Nirvâna which awaits them between the two
              Chains; and similarly for all the other Globes as stated, each
              giving birth to the corresponding Globe of the Earth Chain.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Further,
              when Globe A of the new Chain is ready, the first Class or
              Hierarchy of Monads from the Lunar Chain incarnate upon it in
              the lowest kingdom, and so on successively. The result of this
              is, that it is only the first Class of Monads which attains the
              human state of development during the first Round, since the
              second Class, on each Globe, arriving later, has not time to
              reach that stage. Thus the Monads of Class 2 reach the
              incipient human stage only in the Second Round, and so on up to
              the middle of the Fourth Round. But at this point—and on this
              Fourth Round in which the human stage will be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fully</span></em> developed—the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“door”</span> into the human kingdom
              closes; and henceforward the number of <span class="tei tei-q">“human”</span> Monads, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Monads in the human
              stage of development, is complete. For the Monads which had not
              reached the human stage by this point, will, owing to the
              evolution of Humanity itself, find themselves so far behind,
              that they will reach the human stage only at the close of the
              Seventh and last Round. They will, therefore, not be men on
              this Chain, but will form the Humanity of a future Manvantara,
              and be rewarded by becoming <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span> on a higher Chain altogether, thus
              receiving their Karmic compensation. To this there is
              <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but
              one solitary exception</span></em>, and for very good reasons,
              of which we shall speak farther on. But this accounts for the
              difference in the Races.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It thus
              becomes apparent how perfect is the analogy between the
              processes of Nature in the cosmos and in the individual man.
              The latter lives through his life-cycle, and dies. His higher
              principles, corresponding in the development of a Planetary
              Chain to the cycling Monads, pass into Devachan, which
              corresponds to the Nirvâna and states of rest intervening
              between two Chains. The man's lower principles are
              disintegrated in time, and are used by Nature again for the
              formation of new human principles; the same process also taking
              place in the disintegration and formation of Worlds. Analogy is
              thus the surest guide to the comprehension of the Occult
              teachings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is one
              of the <span class="tei tei-q">“seven mysteries of the
              moon,”</span> and it is now <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg197"></a> revealed. The seven <span class="tei tei-q">“mysteries”</span> are called by the Japanese
              Yamabooshis, the mystics of the Lao-Tze sect and the ascetic
              monks of Kioto, the Dzenodoo—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven
              Jewels”</span>; only, the Japanese and the Chinese Buddhist
              ascetics and Initiates are, if possible, even more reticent in
              giving out their <span class="tei tei-q">“Knowledge”</span>
              than are the Hindûs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
              reader must not be allowed to lose sight of the Monads, and
              must be enlightened as to their nature, as far as permitted,
              without trespassing upon the highest mysteries, of which the
              writer does not in any way pretend to know the last or final
              word.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Monadic
              Host may be roughly divided into three great Classes:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The most
              developed Monads—the Lunar Gods or <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirits,”</span> called, in India, the
              Pitris—whose function it is to pass in the First Round through
              the whole triple cycle of the mineral, vegetable and animal
              kingdoms, in their most ethereal, filmy, and rudimentary forms,
              in order to clothe themselves in, and assimilate, the nature of
              the newly formed Chain. They are those who first reach the
              human form—if there can be any form in the realm of the almost
              subjective—on Globe A, in the First Round. It is they,
              therefore, who lead and represent the human element during the
              Second and Third Rounds, and finally evolve their shadows at
              the beginning of the Fourth Round for the second Class, or
              those who come behind them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. Those
              Monads that are the first to reach the human stage during the
              three and a half Rounds, and to become <span class="tei tei-q">“men.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The
              laggards, the Monads which are retarded, and which will not
              reach, by reason of Karmic impediments, the human stage at all
              during this Cycle or Round, save one exception which will be
              spoken of elsewhere, as already promised.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are
              forced to use above the misleading word <span class="tei tei-q">“men,”</span> and this is a clear proof of how
              little any European language is adapted to express these subtle
              distinctions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It stands to
              reason that these <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span> did not
              resemble the men of to-day, either in form or nature. Why then,
              it may be asked, call them <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span>
              at all? Because there is no other term, in any Western
              language, which approximately conveys the idea intended. The
              word <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span> at least indicates
              that these beings were <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">manus</span></span>,”</span> thinking
              entities, however they differed in form and intellection from
              ourselves. But in reality they were, in respect of spirituality
              and intellection, rather <span class="tei tei-q">“gods”</span>
              than <span class="tei tei-q">“men.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
              difficulty of language is met with in describing the
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg198"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“stages”</span> through which the Monad passes.
              Metaphysically speaking, it is of course an absurdity to talk
              of the <span class="tei tei-q">“development”</span> of a Monad,
              or to say that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em> becomes <span class="tei tei-q">“man.”</span> But any attempt to preserve
              metaphysical accuracy of language, in the use of such a tongue
              as the English, would necessitate at least three extra volumes
              of this work, and would entail an amount of verbal repetition
              which would be wearisome in the extreme. It stands to reason
              that a Monad cannot either progress or develop, or even be
              affected by the changes of state it passes through. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It is not of
              this world or plane</span></em>, and may only be compared to an
              indestructible star of divine light and fire, thrown down on to
              our Earth, as a plank of salvation for the Personalities in
              which it indwells. It is for the latter to cling to it; and
              thus partaking of its divine nature, obtain immortality. Left
              to itself the Monad will cling to no one; but, like the plank,
              be drifted away to another incarnation, by the unresting
              current of evolution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the
              evolution of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> form, or body, round
              the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">astral</span></em>, is produced by the
              terrestrial forces, just as in the case of the lower kingdoms;
              but the evolution of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em>, or real, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Man</span></em>
              is purely spiritual. It is now no more a passage of the
              impersonal Monad through many and various forms of
              matter—endowed at best with instinct and consciousness on quite
              a different plane—as in the case of external evolution, but a
              journey of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilgrim-Soul”</span>
              through various <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">states</span></em> of not only matter, but
              of self-consciousness and self-perception, or of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perception</span></em> from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apperception</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Monad
              emerges from its state of spiritual and intellectual
              unconsciousness; and, skipping the first two planes—too near
              the Absolute to permit of any correlation with anything on a
              lower plane—it gets directly into the plane of Mentality. But
              there is no plane in the whole universe with a broader margin,
              or a wider field of action, in its almost endless gradations of
              perceptive and apperceptive qualities, than this plane, which
              has in its turn an appropriate smaller plane for every
              <span class="tei tei-q">“form,”</span> from the Mineral Monad
              up to the time when that Monad blossoms forth by evolution into
              the Divine Monad. But all the time it is still one and the same
              Monad, differing only in its incarnations, throughout its ever
              succeeding cycles of partial or total obscuration of spirit, or

                life-impulse overflows into Globe B. Then, when the vegetable
                development on Globe A is complete and the animal development
                begins, the vegetable life-impulse overflows to Globe B, and

              That which takes place on the spiritual plane, repeats itself

              the <span class="tei tei-q">“Individual Monads”</span> of men,
              so the Mineral Monad—being at the opposite curve of the

                of the last two principles in man, the sixth and the seventh,

                not to its highest spiritual vivifying principle, Âtmâ,
                alone. But since the Spiritual Soul, if divorced from the
                latter (Âtmâ), could have no existence, no being, it has thus
                been called.... Now the Monadic, or rather Cosmic, Essence,
                if such a term be permitted, in the mineral, vegetable and
                animal, though the same throughout the series of cycles, from
                the lowest elemental up to the Deva kingdom, yet differs in
                the scale of progression. It would be very misleading to
                imagine a Monad as a separate Entity, trailing its slow way
                in a distinct path through the lower kingdoms, and after an
                incalculable series of transformations flowering into a human
                being; in short, that the Monad of a Humboldt dates back to

                scientific hypothesis, is not a particle of something,
                animated by a psychic something, destined after æons to
                blossom into a man. But it is a concrete manifestation of the
                Universal Energy, which itself has not yet become
                individualized; a sequential manifestation of the one
                Universal Monas. The Ocean of Matter does not divide into its
                potential and constituent drops, until the sweep of the
                life-impulse reaches the evolutionary stage of man-birth. The
                tendency towards segregation into individual Monads is
                gradual, and in the higher animals comes almost to the point.
                The Peripatetics applied the word Monas to the whole Kosmos,
                in the pantheistic sense; and the Occultists, while accepting
                this thought for convenience sake, distinguish the
                progressive stages of the evolution of the concrete from the
                abstract, by terms of which the</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Mineral, Vegetable, Animal
                Monad,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">etc., are examples. The term
                merely means that the tidal wave of spiritual evolution is
                passing through that arc of its circuit. The</span>

<span style="font-size: 90%">begins to imperceptibly
                differentiate towards individual consciousness in the
                vegetable kingdom. As the Monads are uncompounded things, as
                correctly defined by Leibnitz, it is the Spiritual Essence
                which vivifies them in their degrees of differentiation,
                which properly constitutes the Monad—not the atomic
                aggregation, which is only the vehicle and the substance
                through which thrill the lower and the higher degrees of
                intelligence.</span><a href="#note_293" id="noteref_293" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leibnitz
              conceived of the Monads as elementary and indestructible units,
              endowed with the power of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">giving and receiving</span></em> with
              respect to other units, and thus of determining all spiritual
              and physical phenomena. It is he who invented the term
              apperception, which together with nerve- (not perception, but
              rather) sensation, expresses the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg202"></a> state of the Monadic consciousness
              through all the kingdoms up to Man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it may
              be wrong, on strictly metaphysical lines, to call Âtmâ-Buddhi a
              Monad, since in the materialistic view it is dual and therefore
              compound. But as Matter is Spirit, and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
              versâ</span></span>; and since the Universe and the Deity which
              informs it are unthinkable apart from each other; so in the
              case of Âtmâ-Buddhi. The latter being the vehicle of the
              former, Buddhi stands in the same relation to Âtmâ, as
              Adam-Kadmon, the Kabalistic Logos, does to Ain Suph, or
              Mûlaprakriti to Parabrahman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now a
              few words more on the Moon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, it may
              be asked, are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lunar
              Monads,”</span> just spoken of? The description of the seven
              Classes of Pitris will come later, but now some general
              explanations may be given. It must be plain to everyone that
              they are Monads, who, having ended their Life-Cycle on the
              Lunar Chain, which is inferior to the Terrestrial Chain, have
              incarnated on the latter. But there are some further details
              which may be added, though they border too closely on forbidden
              ground to be treated of fully. The last word of the mystery is
              divulged only to Adepts, but it may be stated that our
              satellite is only the gross body of its invisible principles.
              Seeing then that there are seven Earths, so there are seven
              Moons, the last alone being visible; the same for the Sun,
              whose visible body is called a Mâyâ, a reflection, just as
              man's body is. <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The real Sun and
              the real Moon are as invisible as the real
              man</span></span>,”</span> says an Occult maxim.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it may
              be remarked, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">en passant</span></span>, that those
              Ancients were not so foolish after all who first started the
              idea of <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Moons.”</span> For
              though this conception is now taken solely as an astronomical
              measure of time, in a very materialized form, yet underlying
              the husk there can still be recognized the traces of a
              profoundly philosophical idea.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reality
              the Moon is the satellite of the Earth in one respect only,
              viz., that physically the Moon revolves round the Earth. But in
              every other respect, it is the Earth which is the satellite of
              the Moon, and not <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>. Startling as the
              statement may seem, it is not without confirmation from
              scientific knowledge. It is evidenced by the tides, by the
              cyclic changes in many forms of disease, which coincide with
              the lunar phases; it can be traced in the growth of plants, and
              is very marked in the phenomena of human conception and
              gestation. The importance of the Moon and its influence on the
              Earth were recognized in every ancient religion, notably the
              Jewish, and have been remarked <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg203"></a> by many observers of psychical and
              physical phenomena. But, so far as Science knows, the Earth's
              action on the Moon is confined to the physical attraction,
              which causes her to circle in her orbit. And should an objector
              insist, that this fact alone is sufficient evidence that the
              Moon is truly the Earth's satellite on other planes of action,
              one may reply by asking whether a mother, who walks round and
              round her child's cradle, keeping watch over the infant, is the
              subordinate of her child or dependent upon it? Though in one
              sense she is its satellite, yet she is certainly older and more
              fully developed than the child she watches.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is, then,
              the Moon that plays the largest and most important part, as
              well in the formation of the Earth itself, as in the peopling
              thereof with human beings. The Lunar Monads, or Pitris, the
              ancestors of man, become in reality man himself. They are the
              Monads, who enter on the cycle of evolution on Globe A, and
              who, passing round the Chain of Globes, evolve the human form,
              as has just been shown. At the beginning of the human stage of
              the Fourth Round on this Globe, they <span class="tei tei-q">“ooze out”</span> their astral doubles, from the
              <span class="tei tei-q">“ape-like”</span> forms which they had
              evolved in the Third Round. And it is this subtle, finer form,
              which serves as the model round which Nature builds physical
              man. These Monads, or Divine Sparks, are thus the Lunar
              Ancestors, the Pitris themselves; for these Lunar Spirits have
              to become <span class="tei tei-q">“men,”</span> in order that
              their Monads may reach a higher plane of activity and
              self-consciousness, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the plane of the
              Mânasa-Putras, those who endow the <span class="tei tei-q">“senseless”</span> shells, created and informed by
              the Pitris, with <span class="tei tei-q">“mind,”</span> in the
              latter part of the Third Root-Race.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same
              way, the Monads, or Egos, of the men of the Seventh Round of
              our Earth, after our own Globes A, B, C, D, etc., parting with
              their life-energy, will have informed, and thereby called to
              life, other laya-centres, destined to live and act on a still
              higher plane of being—in the same way will the Terrene
              Ancestors create those who will become their superiors.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It now
              becomes plain, that there exists in Nature a triple
              evolutionary scheme for the formation of the three <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">periodical</span></em> Upâdhis; or rather
              three separate schemes of evolution, which in our system are
              inextricably interwoven and interblended at every point. These
              are the Monadic (or Spiritual), the Intellectual, and the
              Physical Evolutions. These three are the finite aspects, or the
              reflections on the field of Cosmic Illusion, of Âtmâ, the
              seventh, the One Reality.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg204"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. The
              Monadic, as the name implies, is concerned with the growth and
              development into still higher phases of activity of the Monads,
              in conjunction with:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. The
              Intellectual, represented by the Mânasa-Dhyânis (the Solar
              Devas, or the Agnishvatta Pitris), the <span class="tei tei-q">“givers of intelligence and consciousness”</span>
              to man, and:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. The
              Physical, represented by the Chhâyâs of the Lunar Pitris, round
              which Nature has concreted the present physical body. This body
              serves as the vehicle for the <span class="tei tei-q">“growth,”</span> to use a misleading word, and the
              transformations—through Manas, and owing to the accumulation of
              experiences—of the Finite into the Infinite, of the Transient
              into the Eternal and Absolute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each of
              these three systems has its own laws, and is ruled and guided
              by different sets of the highest Dhyânis or Logoi. Each is
              represented in the constitution of Man, the Microcosm of the
              great Macrocosm; and it is the union of these three streams in
              him, which makes him the complex being he now is.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nature, the
              physical evolutionary Power, could never evolve Intelligence
              unaided; she can only create <span class="tei tei-q">“senseless
              forms,”</span> as will be seen in our Anthropogenesis. The
              Lunar Monads cannot progress, for they have not yet had
              sufficient touch with the forms created by <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature,”</span> to allow of their accumulating
              experiences through its means. It is the Mânasa-Dhyânis who
              fill up the gap, and they represent the evolutionary power of
              Intelligence and Mind, the link between Spirit and Matter—in
              this Round.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Also it must
              be borne in mind that the Monads which enter upon the
              evolutionary cycle upon Globe A, in the first Round, are in
              very different stages of development. Hence the matter becomes
              somewhat complicated. Let us recapitulate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
              developed, the Lunar Monads, reach the human germ-stage in the
              First Round; become terrestrial, though very ethereal, human
              beings towards the end of the Third Round, remaining on the
              Globe through the <span class="tei tei-q">“obscuration”</span>
              period, as the seed for future mankind in the Fourth Round, and
              thus become the pioneers of Humanity at the beginning of this,
              the present Fourth Round. Others reach the human stage only
              during later Rounds, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, in the second, third
              or first half of the Fourth Round. And finally the most
              retarded of all—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, those still occupying
              animal forms after the middle turning-point of the Fourth
              Round—will not become men at all during this Manvantara.
              <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg205"></a> They will reach
              to the verge of Humanity only at the close of the Seventh
              Round, to be, in their turn, ushered into a new Chain, after
              Pralaya, by older pioneers, the progenitors of Humanity, or the
              Seed-Humanity (Shishta), viz., the men who will be at the head
              of all at the end of these Rounds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The student
              scarcely needs any further explanation on the part played by
              the Fourth Globe and the Fourth Round in the scheme of
              evolution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
              preceding diagrams, which are applicable, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mutatis
              mutandis</span></span>, to Rounds, Globes or Races, it will be
              seen that the fourth member of a series occupies a unique
              position. Unlike the others, the Fourth has no <span class="tei tei-q">“sister”</span> Globe on the same plane as itself,
              and it thus forms the fulcrum of the <span class="tei tei-q">“balance”</span> represented by the whole Chain. It
              is the sphere of final evolutionary adjustments, the world of
              the Karmic scales, the Hall of Justice, where the balance is
              struck which determines the future course of the Monad during
              the remainder of its incarnations in the Cycle. And therefore
              is it that, after this central turning-point has been passed in
              the Great Cycle—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, after the middle point
              of the Fourth Race in the Fourth Round on our Globe—no more
              Monads can enter the human kingdom. The door is closed for this
              Cycle, and the balance struck. For were it otherwise—had there
              been a new soul created for each of the countless milliards of
              human beings that have passed away, and had there been no
              reïncarnation—it would become difficult indeed to provide room
              for the disembodied <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span>;
              nor could the origin and cause of suffering ever be accounted
              for. It is the ignorance of the Occult tenets, and the
              enforcement of false conceptions under the guise of religious
              education, which have created Materialism and Atheism as a
              protest against the asserted divine order of things.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only
              exceptions to the rule just stated are the <span class="tei tei-q">“dumb races,”</span> whose Monads are already
              within the human stage, in virtue of the fact that these
              <span class="tei tei-q">“animals”</span> are later than, and
              even half descended from, man; their last descendants being the
              anthropoid and other apes. These <span class="tei tei-q">“human
              presentments”</span> are in truth only the distorted copies of
              the early humanity. But this will receive full attention in the
              next volume.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the
              Commentary, broadly rendered, says:</p>

              and internal growth and development, have all one and the same
              object—Man; Man, as the highest physical and ultimate form on
              this Earth; the</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-style: italic">Monad,</span><span style="font-style: italic">”</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">in its absolute totality and awakened
              condition—as the culmination of the divine incarnations on
              Earth.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">2. The Dhyânis
              [Pitris] are those who have evolved their Bhuta [Doubles] from
              themselves, which Rûpa [Form] has become the vehicle of Monads
              [Seventh and Sixth principles] that had completed their cycle
              of transmigration in the three preceding Kalpas [Rounds]. Then,
              they [the Astral Doubles] became the men of the first Human
              Race of the Round. But they were not complete, and were
              senseless.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This will be
              explained in the sequel. Meanwhile man—or rather his Monad—has
              existed on Earth from the very beginning of this Round. But, up
              to our own Fifth Race, the external shapes which covered those
              divine Astral Doubles, have changed and consolidated with every
              sub-race; the form and physical structure of the fauna changing
              at the same time, as they had to be adapted to the
              ever-changing conditions of life on this Globe, during the
              geological periods of its formative cycle. And thus will they
              go on changing with every Root-Race, and every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">chief</span></em> sub-race, down to the
              last one of the Seventh in this Round.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">3. The inner, now
              concealed, man, was then [in the beginnings] the external man.
              The progeny of the Dhyânis [Pitris], he was</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-style: italic">the son like unto his
              father.</span><span style="font-style: italic">”</span></span>
<span style="font-style: italic">Like the lotus, whose external
              shape assumes gradually the form of the model within itself, so
              did the form of man in the beginning evolve from within
              without. After the cycle in which man began to procreate his
              species after the fashion of the present animal kingdom, it
              became the reverse. The human fœtus follows now in its
              transformations all the forms that the physical frame of man
              assumed, throughout the three Kalpas [Rounds], during the
              tentative efforts at plastic formation around the Monad, by
              senseless, because imperfect, matter, in her blind wanderings.
              In the present age, the physical embryo is a plant, a reptile,
              an animal, before it finally becomes man, evolving within
              himself his own ethereal counterpart, in his turn. In the
              beginning it was that counterpart [astral man] which, being
              senseless, got entangled in the meshes of
              matter.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this
              <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> belongs to the Fourth
              Round. As shown, the Monad had passed through, journeyed and
              been imprisoned in, every transitional form, throughout every
              kingdom of nature, during the three preceding Rounds. But the
              Monad which becomes human, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not the
              Man</span></em>. In this Round—with the exception of the
              highest mammals after man, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg207"></a> the anthropoids destined to die out in
              this our race, when their Monads will be liberated and pass
              into the astral human forms, or the highest elementals, of the
              Sixth and the Seventh Races, and then into the lowest human
              forms in the Fifth Round—no units of any of the kingdoms are
              animated any longer by Monads destined to become human in their
              next stage, but only by the lower elementals of their
              respective realms. These <span class="tei tei-q">“elementals”</span> will become human Monads, in
              their turn, only at the next great planetary Manvantara.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And in fact
              the last human Monad incarnated before the beginning of the
              Fifth Root-Race. Nature never repeats herself; therefore the
              anthropoids of our day have not existed at any time since the
              middle of the Miocene period, when, like all cross breeds, they
              began to show a tendency, more and more marked as time went on,
              to return to the type of their first parent, the gigantic black
              and yellow Lemuro-Atlantean. To search for the <span class="tei tei-q">“missing link”</span> is useless. To the Scientists
              of the closing Sixth Root-Race, millions and millions of years
              hence, our modern races, or rather their fossils, will appear
              as those of small insignificant apes—an extinct species of the
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">genus homo</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such
              anthropoids form an exception because they were not intended by
              Nature, but are the direct product and creation of <span class="tei tei-q">“senseless”</span> man. The Hindûs attribute a
              divine origin to the apes and monkeys, because the men of the
              Third Race were gods from another plane, who had become
              <span class="tei tei-q">“senseless”</span> mortals. This
              subject had already been touched upon in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
              Unveiled</span></span>, twelve years ago, as plainly as was
              then possible. The reader is there referred to the Brâhmans, if
              he would know the reason of the regard they have for the
              monkeys.</p>

<span style="font-size: 90%">He [the reader] would perhaps
                learn—were the Brâhman to judge him worthy of an
                explanation—that the Hindû sees in the ape but what Manu
                desired he should: the transformation of species most
                directly connected with that of the human family—a bastard
                branch engrafted on their own stock before the final
                perfection of the latter. He might learn, further, that in
                the eyes of the educated</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">heathen</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">the spiritual or inner man is one thing, and
                his terrestrial physical casket another. That physical
                nature, that great combination of correlations of physical
                forces, ever creeping on towards perfection, has to avail
                herself of the material at hand; she models and remodels as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, a
              German scientific work is mentioned in a footnote on the same
              page. It says that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">

<span style="font-size: 90%">A Hanoverian Scientist has
                recently published a work entitled,</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Ueber die</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg208"></a><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Auflösung der Arten
                durch Natürliche Zucht-wahl</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, in which he shows, with great ingenuity,
                that Darwin was wholly mistaken in tracing man back to the
                ape. On the contrary, he maintains that it is the ape which
                is evolved from man. He shows that, in the beginning, mankind
                were, morally and physically, the types and prototypes of our
                present race and of our human dignity, by their beauty of
                form, regularity of feature, cranial development, nobility of
                sentiments, heroic impulses, and grandeur of ideal
                conceptions. This is a purely Brâhmanic, Buddhistic and
                Kabalistic doctrine. His book is copiously illustrated with
                diagrams, tables, etc. It asserts that the gradual debasement
                and degradation of man, morally and physically, can be
                readily traced throughout ethnological transformations down
                to our time. And, as one portion has already degenerated into
                apes, so the civilized man of the present day will at last,
                under the action of the inevitable law of necessity, be also
                succeeded by like descendants. If we may judge of the future
                by the actual present, it certainly does seem possible that
                so unspiritual and materialistic a race should end as Simia
                rather than as Seraphs.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though
              the apes descend from man, it is certainly not the fact that
              the human Monad, which has once reached the level of humanity,
              ever incarnates again in the form of an animal.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cycle of
              <span class="tei tei-q">“metempsychosis”</span> for the human
              Monad is closed, for we are in the Fourth Round and the Fifth
              Root-Race. The reader will have to bear in mind—at any rate one
              who has made himself acquainted with <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span>—that the Stanzas which follow in this
              volume and the next speak of the evolution in our Fourth Round
              only. The latter is the cycle of the turning-point, after
              which, matter, having reached its lowest depths, begins to
              strive onward and to become spiritualized, with every new race
              and with every fresh cycle. Therefore the student must take
              care not to see contradiction where there is none, for in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span> Rounds are
              spoken of in general, while here only the Fourth, or our
              present Round, is meant. Then it was the work of formation; now
              it is that of reformation and evolutionary perfection.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, to
              close this digression anent various, but unavoidable,
              misconceptions, we must refer to a statement in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span>, which has produced a very fatal
              impression upon the minds of many Theosophists. One unfortunate
              sentence, from the work just referred to, is constantly brought
              forward to prove the materialism of the doctrine. The author,
              referring to the progress of organisms on the Globes, says
              that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

<span style="font-size: 90%">The mineral kingdom will no more
                develop the vegetable ... than the Earth was able to develop

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether this
              sentence renders the thought of the author literally, or is
              simply, as we believe it is, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lapsus
              calami</span></span>, may remain an open question.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is really
              with surprise that we have ascertained the fact, that
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span> was so
              little understood by some Theosophists, as to have led them
              into the belief that it thoroughly supported Darwinian
              evolution, and especially the theory of the descent of man from
              a pithecoid ancestor. As one member writes: <span class="tei tei-q">“I suppose you realize that three-fourths of
              Theosophists and even outsiders imagine that, as far as the
              evolution of man is concerned, Darwinism and Theosophy kiss one
              another.”</span> Nothing of the kind was ever realized, nor is
              there any great warrant for it, so far as we know, in
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>. It has
              been repeatedly stated, that evolution as taught by Manu and
              Kapila was the groundwork of the modern teachings, but neither
              Occultism nor Theosophy has ever supported the wild theories of
              the present Darwinists—least of all the descent of man from an
              ape. Of this, more hereafter. But one has only to turn to p. 47
              of the work named, to find the statement that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

<span style="font-size: 90%">Man belongs to a kingdom
                distinctly separate from that of the animals.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With such a
              plain and unequivocal statement before him, it is very strange
              that any careful student should have been so misled, unless he
              is prepared to charge the author with a gross
              contradiction.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every Round
              repeats the evolutionary work of the preceding Round, on a
              higher scale. With the exception of some higher anthropoids, as
              just mentioned, the Monadic inflow, or inner evolution, is at
              an end till the next Manvantara. It can never be too often
              repeated that the full-blown human Monads have to be first
              disposed of, before the new crop of candidates appears on this
              Globe at the beginning of the next Cycle. Thus there is a lull;
              and this is why, during the Fourth Round, man appears on Earth
              earlier than any animal creation, as will be described.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is
              still urged that the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span> has <span class="tei tei-q">“preached
              Darwinism”</span> all along. Certain passages would undoubtedly
              seem to lend countenance to this inference. Besides which, the
              Occultists themselves are ready to concede <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">partial</span></em> correctness to the
              Darwinian hypothesis, in later details, bye-laws of evolution,
              and after the midway point of the Fourth Race. Of that which
              has taken place, Physical Science can really know nothing, for
              such matters lie entirely outside of its sphere of
              investigation. But what the Occultists have never admitted, nor
              will they ever admit, is that man was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an ape
              in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg

              any other Round</span></em>; or that he ever could be one,
              however much he may have been <span class="tei tei-q">“ape-like.”</span> This is vouched for by the very
              authority from whom the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span> got his information.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus to
              those who confront the Occultists with these lines from the
              above-named volume:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

                mineral forms, as of the same sort of impulse concerned

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To those who
              bring this passage forward as showing <span class="tei tei-q">“decided Darwinism,”</span> the Occultists answer
              by pointing to the explanation of the Master, Mr. Sinnett's
              Teacher, which would contradict these lines, were they written
              in the spirit attributed to them. A copy of this letter was
              sent to the writer, together with others, two years ago (1886),
              with additional marginal remarks, to quote from, in the
              <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secret Doctrine</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It begins by
              considering the difficulty experienced by the Western student,
              in reconciling some facts, previously given, with the evolution
              of man from the animal, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, from the mineral,
              vegetable and animal kingdoms, and advises the student to hold
              to the doctrine of analogy and correspondences. Then it touches
              upon the mystery of the Devas, and even Gods, having to pass
              through states, which it was agreed to refer to as <span class="tei tei-q">“Immetallization, Inherbation, Inzoönization and
              finally Incarnation,”</span> and explains this by hinting at
              the necessity of failures even in the ethereal races of Dhyân
              Chohans. Concerning this it says:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">These</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">‘</span><span style="font-style: italic">failures</span><span style="font-style: italic">’</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">are too far progressed and spiritualized
              to be thrown back forcibly from Dhyân Chohanship into the
              vortex of a new primordial evolution through the lower
              kingdoms</span></span>....”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After which,
              a hint only is given about the mystery contained in the
              allegory of the fallen Asuras, which will be expanded and
              explained in Volume II. When Karma has reached them at the
              stage of human evolution:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They will have to drink it to the last
              drop in the bitter cup of retribution. Then they become an
              active force and commingle with the elementals, the progressed
              entities of the pure animal kingdom, to develop little by
              little the full type of humanity.</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These Dhyân
              Chohans, as we see, do not pass through the three kingdoms as
              do the lower Pitris; nor do they incarnate in man until the
              Third Root Race. Thus, as the teaching stands:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Round I. Man in the First Round and First

              was an ethereal being (a Lunar Dhyâni, as man), non-intelligent
              but super-spiritual; and correspondingly, on the law of
              analogy, in the First Race of the Fourth Round. In each of the
              subsequent races and sub-races, ... he grows more and more into
              an encased or incarnate being, but still preponderatingly
              ethereal.... He is sexless, and, like the animal and vegetable,
              he develops monstrous bodies correspondential with his coarser
              surroundings.</span></span></span></p>

              ethereal, but growing firmer and more condensed in body; a more
              physical man yet still less intelligent than spiritual (1), for
              mind is a slower and more difficult evolution than is the
              physical frame....</span></span></span></p>

              or compacted body, at first the form of a giant-ape, and now
              more intelligent, or rather cunning, than spiritual. For, on
              the downward arc, he has now reached a point where his
              primordial spirituality is eclipsed and overshadowed by nascent
              mentality (2). In the last half of the Third Round, his
              gigantic stature decreases, and his body improves in texture,
              and he becomes a more rational being, though still more an ape
              than a Deva.... [All this is almost exactly repeated in the
              Third Root-Race of the Fourth Round.]</span></span></span></p>

              human mentality, and you have the true version on your
              thumb-nail....</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are
              the words of the Teacher; text, words and sentences in
              brackets, and explanatory footnotes. It stands to reason that
              there must be an enormous difference in such terms as
              <span class="tei tei-q">“objectivity”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“subjectivity,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“materiality”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“spirituality,”</span> when the same terms are
              applied to different planes of being and perception. All this
              must be taken in its relative sense. And therefore there is
              little to be wondered at, if, left to his own speculations, an
              author who, however eager to learn, was yet quite inexperienced
              in these abstruse teachings, has fallen into an error. Nor was
              the difference between the Rounds and the Races sufficiently
              defined in the letters received, since nothing of the kind had
              been required before, as the ordinary Eastern disciple would
              have found out the difference in a moment. Moreover, to quote
              from a letter of the Master:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The teachings were imparted under
              protest.... They were, so to say, smuggled goods ... and when I
              remained face to face with only one correspondent, the other,
              Mr. ... had so far tossed all the cards into confusion, that
              little remained to be said without trespassing upon
              law.</span></span>”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theosophists
              <span class="tei tei-q">“whom it may concern”</span> will
              understand what is meant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The outcome
              of all this is, that nothing had ever been said in the letters
              to warrant the assurance, that the Occult doctrine has ever
              taught, or any Adept believed in, unless metaphorically, the
              preposterous modern theory of the descent of man from a common
              ancestor with the ape—an anthropoid of the actual animal kind.
              To this day the world is more full of ape-like men than the
              woods are of men-like apes. The ape is sacred in India because
              its origin is well known to the Initiates, though concealed
              under a thick veil of allegory. Hanumâna is the son of Pavana
              (Vâyu, <span class="tei tei-q">“God of the wind”</span>) by
              Anjanâ, wife of a monster called Kesarî, though his genealogy
              varies. The reader who bears this in mind, will find in Volume
              II, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">passim</span></span>, the whole
              explanation of this ingenious allegory. The <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span> of the Third Race (who separated) were
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> by their spirituality
              and purity, though senseless, and as yet destitute of mind, as
              men.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
              <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span> of the Third Race, the
              ancestors of the Atlanteans, were just such ape-like,
              intellectually senseless, giants as were those beings, who,
              during the Third Round, represented Humanity. Morally
              irresponsible, it was these Third Race <span class="tei tei-q">“men”</span> who, through promiscuous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg213"></a> connection with animal
              species lower than themselves, created that missing link which
              became ages later (in the Tertiary period only), the remote
              ancestor of the real ape, as we find it now in the pithecoid
              family.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And if this
              is found clashing with the statement which shows the animal
              later than man, then the reader is asked to bear in mind that
              the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">placental mammal</span></em> only is
              meant. In those days, there were animals of which Zoölogy does
              not even dream in our own; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and the modes of
              reproduction were not identical</span></span> with the notions
              which modern Physiology has upon the subject. It is not
              altogether convenient to touch upon such questions in public,
              but there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> contradiction or
              impossibility in this whatever.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
              earlier teachings, however unsatisfactory, vague and
              fragmentary, did not teach the evolution of <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> from the <span class="tei tei-q">“ape.”</span> Nor does the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
              Buddhism</span></span> assert it anywhere in his work in so
              many words; but, owing to his inclination towards Modern
              Science, he uses language which might perhaps justify such an
              inference. The man who preceded the Fourth, the Atlantean,
              Race, however much he may have looked physically like a
              <span class="tei tei-q">“gigantic ape”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“the counterfeit of man who hath not the life of a
              man”</span>—was still a thinking and already a speaking man.
              The Lemuro-Atlantean was a highly civilized Race, and if one
              accepts tradition, which is better history than the speculative
              fiction which now passes under that name, he was higher than we
              are with all our sciences and the degraded civilization of the
              day: at any rate, the Lemuro-Atlantean of the closing Third
              Race was so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now we
              may return to the Stanzas.</p>

            reading the additional detailed explanations, in the
            Anthropogenesis and its Commentaries, in Volume II. Between this
            Shloka and Shloka 4, extend long ages; and there now gleams the
            dawn and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg

            sunrise of another æon. The drama enacted on our planet is at the
            beginning of its fourth act; but for a clearer comprehension of
            the whole play the reader will have to turn back before he can
            proceed onward. For this verse belongs to the general Cosmogony
            given in the archaic volumes, whereas Volume II will give a
            detailed account of the <span class="tei tei-q">“creation,”</span> or rather formation, of the first
            human beings, followed by the second humanity, and then by the
            third; or, as they are called, the First, Second, and the Third
            Root-Races. As the solid Earth began by being a ball of liquid
            fire, of fiery dust and its protoplasmic phantom, so did man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>)
            That which is meant by the qualification the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fourth,”</span> is explained as the Fourth Round,
            only on the authority of the Commentaries. It can equally mean
            Fourth Eternity as Fourth Round, or even our Fourth Globe. For,
            as will repeatedly be shown, the latter is the fourth sphere, on
            the fourth or lowest plane of material life. And it so happens
            that we are in the Fourth Round, at the middle point of which the
            perfect equilibrium between Spirit and Matter had to take
            place.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was, as we
            shall see, at this period—during the highest point of
            civilization and knowledge, and also of human intellectuality, of
            the Fourth, Atlantean Race—that, owing to the final crisis of the
            physiologico-spiritual adjustment of the races, humanity branched
            off into two diametrically opposite paths: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Right-</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Left-hand</span></em> Paths of Knowledge or
            Vidyâ. In the words of the Commentary:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thus were the germs
            of the White and the Black Magic sown in those days. The seeds
            lay latent for some time, to sprout only during the early period
            of the Fifth [our Race].</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Says the
            Commentary explaining the Shloka:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Holy Youths
            [the Gods] refused to multiply and create species after their
            likeness, after their kind.</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-style: italic">They are not fit Forms [Rûpas] for us. They
            have to grow.</span><span style="font-style: italic">”</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">They refuse to enter the Chhâyâs [Shadows or
            Images] of their inferiors. Thus had selfish feeling prevailed
            from the beginning, even among the Gods, and they fell under the
            eye of the Karmic Lipikas.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had to
            suffer for it in later births. How the punishment reached the
            Gods will be seen in Volume II.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is a
            universal tradition that, before the physiological <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall,”</span> propagation of one's kind, whether
            human or animal, took place through the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Will</span></span>
            of the Creators, or of their progeny. This was the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg215"></a> Fall of Spirit into
            generation, not the Fall of mortal Man. It has already been
            stated that, to become self-conscious, Spirit must pass through
            every cycle of being, culminating in its highest point on earth
            in Man. Spirit <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span> is an unconscious
            negative <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstraction</span></em>. Its purity is
            inherent, not acquired by merit; hence, as already shown, to
            become the highest Dhyân Chohan, it is necessary for each Ego to
            attain to full self-consciousness as a human, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            conscious, being, which is synthesized for us in Man. The Jewish
            Kabalists, arguing that no Spirit can belong to the divine
            Hierarchy unless Ruach (Spirit) is united to Nephesh (Living
            Soul), only repeat the Eastern Esoteric teaching:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">A Dhyâni has to be
            an Âtmâ-Buddhi; once the Buddhi-Manas breaks loose from the
            immortal Âtmâ, of which it (Buddhi) is the vehicle, Âtman passes
            into Non-Being, which is Absolute Being.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This means
            that the purely Nirvânic state is a passage of Spirit back to the
            ideal abstraction of Be-ness, which has no relation to the plane
            on which our Universe is accomplishing its cycle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
            <span class="tei tei-q">“The Curse is pronounced”</span> does not
            mean, in this instance, that any Personal Being, God, or Superior
            Spirit, pronounced it, but simply that the cause, which could but
            create bad results, had been generated; and that the effects of
            this Karmic cause could lead the Beings that counteracted the
            laws of Nature, and thus impeded her legitimate progress, only to
            bad incarnations, hence to suffering.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>)
            <span class="tei tei-q">“There were many Wars,”</span> all
            referring to struggles of adjustment, spiritual, cosmical and
            astronomical, but chiefly to the mystery of the evolution of man,
            as he is now. The Powers or pure Essences that were <span class="tei tei-q">“told to create,”</span> relate to a mystery
            explained, as already said, elsewhere. It is not only one of the
            most hidden secrets of Nature—that of generation, over whose
            solution the Embryologists have vainly put their heads
            together—but likewise a divine function which involves that great
            religious, or rather dogmatic, mystery, the so-called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall”</span> of the Angels. Satan and
            his rebellious host, when the meaning of the allegory is
            explained, will thus prove to have refused to create physical
            man, only to become the direct Saviours and Creators of divine
            Man. The symbolical teaching is more than mystical and religious,
            it is purely scientific, as will be seen later on. For, instead
            of remaining a mere blind functioning medium, impelled and guided
            by fathomless Law, the <span class="tei tei-q">“rebellious”</span> Angel claimed and enforced his
            right of independent judgment and will, his right of free-agency
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg216"></a> and
            responsibility, since Man and Angel are alike under Karmic
            Law.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Explaining
            Kabalistic views, the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Aspects of

            kingdom and reign of spirits and spiritual action, which flow
            from and are the product of spirit-volition, are outside, and
            contrasted with, and in contradiction to, the kingdom of souls
            and divine action.</span><a href="#note_300" id="noteref_300" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a></p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
            diametrically opposite to our Eastern teaching, and even to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here one finds

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg218"></a> as the
            Zoroastrian, and detects a germ of the dogmatic and dualistic
            religions of the future, a germ which has grown into such a
            luxuriant tree in ecclesiastical Christianity. It is already the
            outline of the two <span class="tei tei-q">“Supremes”</span>—God
            and Satan. But in the Stanzas no such idea exists.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most of the
            Western Christian Kabalists—preëminently Éliphas Lévi—in their
            desire to reconcile the Occult Sciences with Church Dogmas, did
            their best to make of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Astral
            Light”</span> only and preeminently the Plerôma of the early
            Church Fathers, the abode of the Hosts of the Fallen Angels, of
            the Archôns and Powers. But the Astral Light, though only the
            lower aspect of the Absolute, is still dual. It is the Anima
            Mundi, and ought never to be viewed otherwise, except for
            Kabalistic purposes. The difference which exists between its
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Light”</span> and its <span class="tei tei-q">“Living Fire,”</span> ought ever to be present in the
            mind of the Seer and the Psychic. The higher aspect of this
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Light,”</span> without which only
            creatures of matter can be produced, is this Living Fire, and its
            Seventh Principle. It is stated in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis

            female portion (the Spiritus of the Nazarenes) is tainted, in one

            as with Roman Catholics—the texts varying slightly in their
            interpretations—they all were the Genii of the seven planets, and
            of the seven planetary spheres of our septenary Chain, of which
            Earth is the lowest. This connects the <span class="tei tei-q">“Stellar”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Lunar”</span> Spirits with the higher planetary
            Angels, and the Saptarshis, the Seven Rishis of the Stars,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg220"></a> of the Hindûs—as
            subordinate Angels, or Messengers, to these Rishis, their
            emanations, on the descending scale. Such, in the opinion of the
            philosophical Gnostics, were the God and the Archangels now
            worshipped by the Christians! The <span class="tei tei-q">“Fallen
            Angels”</span> and the legend of the <span class="tei tei-q">“War
            in Heaven”</span> are thus purely pagan in their origin, and come
            from India, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">viá</span></span> Persia and Chaldea. The
            only reference to them in the Christian canon is found in

            evolve after a periodical Pralaya, rebuilt from old material into
            new forms. The previous Globes disintegrate and reäppear,
            transformed and perfected for a new phase of life. In the

            to sparks which fly from under the hammer of the great

            in the German language. We rejoice to hear it, for ours is an
            Occult teaching lost in the darkness of archaic ages. We have
            treated of it fully in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>,<a href="#note_325" id="noteref_325" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a> and
            the idea of Darwinian-like evolution, of struggle for life and
            supremacy, and of the <span class="tei tei-q">“survival of the
            fittest,”</span> among the Hosts above as of the Hosts below,
            runs throughout both the volumes of our earlier work, written in
            1876. But the idea is not ours, it is that of antiquity. Even the
            Purânic writers have ingeniously interwoven allegory with cosmic
            facts and human events. Any symbologist may discern their
            astro-cosmical allusions, even though he be unable to grasp the
            whole meaning. The great <span class="tei tei-q">“wars in
            heaven,”</span> in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>; the wars of the
            Titans, in Hesiod and other classical writers; the <span class="tei tei-q">“struggles”</span> also between Osiris and Typhon, in
            the Egyptian myth; and even those in the Scandinavian legends;
            all refer to the same subject. Northern Mythology refers to it as
            the battle of the Flames, the sons of Muspel who fought on the
            field of Wigred. All these relate to Heaven and Earth, and have a
            double, and often even a triple, meaning and esoteric application
            to things above as to things below. They severally relate to
            astronomical, theogonical and human struggles; to the adjustment
            of orbs, and the supremacy among nations and tribes. The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“struggle for existence”</span> and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“survival of the fittest”</span> reigned
            supreme from the moment that Kosmos manifested into being, and
            could hardly escape the observant eye of the ancient Sages. Hence
            the incessant fights of Indra, the God of the Firmament, with the
            Asuras—degraded from high Gods into cosmic Demons—and with Vritra
            or Ahi; the battles fought between stars and constellations,
            between moons and planets—later on incarnated as kings and
            mortals. Hence also the War in Heaven of Michael and his Host
            against the Dragon—Jupiter and Lucifer Venus—when <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg224"></a> a third of the stars of the
            rebellious Host was hurled down into Space, and <span class="tei tei-q">“its place was found no more in Heaven.”</span> As we

            not be rejected even by modern speculation, could the latter
            thoroughly understand its teachings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For archaic
            astronomy and the ancient physical and mathematical sciences
            expressed views identical with those of Modern Science, and many
            of far more momentous import. A <span class="tei tei-q">“struggle
            for life”</span> and a <span class="tei tei-q">“survival of the
            fittest,”</span> in the worlds above and on our planet here
            below, are distinctly taught. This teaching, however, although it
            would not be entirely rejected by Science, is sure to be
            repudiated as an integral whole. For it avers that there are only
            seven self-born primordial <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span>
            emanated from the trinitarian One. In other words, it means that
            all the worlds, or sidereal bodies—always on strict analogy—are
            formed one from the other, after the primordial manifestation at
            the beginning of the Great Age is accomplished.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The birth of
            the celestial bodies in space is compared to a multitude of
            pilgrims at the Festival of the Fires. Seven ascetics appear on
            the threshold of the temple with seven lighted sticks of incense.
            At the light of these the first row of pilgrims light their
            incense sticks. After which, every ascetic begins whirling his
            stick around his head in space, and furnishes the rest with fire.
            Thus with the heavenly bodies. A laya-centre is lighted and
            awakened into life by the fires of another <span class="tei tei-q">“pilgrim,”</span> after which, the new <span class="tei tei-q">“centre”</span> rushes into space and becomes a
            comet. It is only after losing its velocity, and hence its fiery
            tail, that the Fiery Dragon settles down into quiet and steady
            life, as a regular respectable citizen of the sidereal family.
            Therefore it is said:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg225"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Born in the
            unfathomable depths of Space, out of the homogeneous Element
            called the World-Soul, every nucleus of cosmic matter, suddenly
            launched into being, begins life under the most hostile
            circumstances. Through a series of countless ages, it has to
            conquer for itself a place in the infinitudes. It circles round
            and round, between denser and already fixed bodies, moving by
            jerks, and pulling towards some given point or centre that
            attracts it, and, like as a ship drawn into a channel dotted with
            reefs and sunken rocks, trying to avoid other bodies that draw
            and repel it in turn. Many perish, their mass disintegrating
            through stronger masses, and, when born within a system, chiefly
            within the insatiable stomachs of various Suns. Those which move
            slower, and are propelled into an elliptic course, are doomed to
            annihilation sooner or later. Others, moving in parabolic curves,
            generally escape destruction, owing to their
            velocity.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some very
            critical readers will perhaps imagine that this teaching, as to
            the cometary stage passed through by all heavenly bodies, is in
            contradiction with the statements just made as to the Moon being
            the mother of the Earth. They will perhaps fancy that intuition
            is needed to harmonize the two. But no intuition is in truth
            required. What does Science know of comets, their genesis,
            growth, and ultimate behaviour? Nothing—absolutely nothing! And
            what is there so impossible in that a laya-centre—a lump of

            above will be regarded as archaic nonsense, but it will be better
            comprehended, if the reader remembers the Aurora Borealis and
            Australis, both of which take place at the very centres of
            terrestrial electric and magnetic forces. The two Poles are said
            to be the store-houses, the receptacles and liberators, at the
            same time, of cosmic and terrestrial Vitality (Electricity), from
            the surplus of which the Earth, had it not been for these two
            natural safety-valves, would have been rent to pieces long ago.
            At the same time it is a theory that has lately become an axiom,
            that the phenomenon of the polar lights is accompanied by, and
            productive of, strong sounds, like whistling, hissing and

            take for our basis the above figures, we have first of all to
            eliminate from the 100 Years of Brahmâ, or 311,040,000,000,000
            years, two Years taken up by the Sandhyâs (Twilights), which

            some chronological hints will be given. We must remember,

            vortices), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our sun and planets</span></em>—to put it
            briefly. This cannot be so very <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unscientific</span></em>, since Descartes

            There are four grades of Initiation mentioned in exoteric works,
            which are known respectively in Sanskrit as Srotâpanna,
            Sakridâgâmin, Anâgâmin, and Arhan; the Four Paths to Nirvâna, in
            this our Fourth Round, bearing the same appellations. The Arhan,
            though he can see the Past, the Present and the Future, is not
            yet the highest Initiate; for the Adept himself, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">initiated</span></em> candidate, becomes
            Chelâ (Pupil) to a higher Initiate. Three higher grades have
            still to be conquered by the Arhan who would reach the apex of
            the ladder of Arhatship. There are those who have reached it even
            in this Fifth Race of ours, but the faculties necessary for the
            attainment of these higher grades will be fully developed, in the
            average ascetic, only at the end of this Root-Race, and in the
            Sixth and Seventh. Thus, there will always <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg228"></a> be Initiates and the Profane
            until the end of this minor Manvantara, the present Life-Cycle.
            The Arhats of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire-Mist,”</span> of
            the Seventh Rung, are but one remove from the Root-Base of their
            Hierarchy, the highest on Earth and our Terrestrial Chain. This
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Root-Base”</span> has a name which can
            only be translated into English by several compound words—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ever-Living-Human-Banyan.”</span> This
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wondrous Being”</span> descended from a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“high region,”</span> they say, in the
            early part of the Third Age, before the separation of sexes in
            the Third Race.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Third
            Race is sometimes called collectively the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Passive Yoga,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            it was produced unconsciously by the Second Race, which, as it
            was intellectually inactive, is supposed to have been constantly
            plunged in a kind of blank or abstract contemplation, as required
            by the conditions of the Yoga state. In the first or earlier
            portion of the existence of this Third Race, while it was yet in
            its state of purity, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of
            Wisdom,”</span> who, as will be seen, incarnated in this
            Root-Race, produced by Kriyâshakti a progeny, called the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Ad,”</span> or of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire-Mist,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Will and Yoga,”</span> etc. They were a
            conscious production, as a portion of the Race was already
            animated with the divine spark of spiritual, superior
            intelligence. This progeny was not a race. It was at first a
            Wondrous Being, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Initiator,”</span> and after him a group of
            semi-divine and semi-human Beings. <span class="tei tei-q">“Set
            apart”</span> in archaic genesis for certain purposes, they are
            those in whom are said to have incarnated the highest
            Dhyânis—<span class="tei tei-q">“Munis and Rishis from previous

            These <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Will and Yoga,”</span>
            born, so to speak, in an immaculate way, remained, it is
            explained, entirely apart from the rest of mankind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Being”</span> just referred to, who has
            to remain nameless, is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tree</span></em> from which, in subsequent

            he is the mysterious (to the profane—the ever invisible, yet ever
            present) Personage, about whom legends are rife in the East,
            especially among the Occultists and the students of the Sacred
            Science. It is he who changes form, yet remains ever the same.
            And it is he, again, who holds spiritual sway over the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">initiated</span></em> Adepts throughout the
            whole world. He is, as said, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Nameless One”</span> who has so many names, and yet

            For, sitting at the Threshold <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg229"></a> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Light</span></span>, he looks into it
            from within the Circle of Darkness, which he will not cross; nor
            will he quit his post till the last Day of this Life-Cycle. Why
            does the Solitary Watcher remain at his self-chosen post? Why
            does he sit by the Fountain of Primeval Wisdom, of which he
            drinks no longer, for he has naught to learn which he does not
            know—aye, neither on this Earth, nor in its Heaven? Because the
            lonely, sore-footed Pilgrims, on their journey back to their
            Home, are never sure, to the last moment, of not losing their
            way, in this limitless desert of Illusion and Matter called
            Earth-Life. Because he would fain show the way to that region of
            freedom and light, from which he is a voluntary exile himself, to
            every prisoner who has succeeded in liberating himself from the
            bonds of flesh and illusion. Because, in short, he has sacrificed
            himself for the sake of Mankind, though but a few elect may
            profit by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Great Sacrifice</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is under

            first awakening of human consciousness, the guides of early
            Humanity. It is through these <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of

            the arts and sciences, as well as of spiritual knowledge; and it

            him for further details to the Section, entitled <span class="tei tei-q">“The Sons of God and the Sacred Island,”</span>
            attached to Stanza IX of Volume II. A few more explanations,
            however, though thrown out in a fragmentary form, may help the
            student to obtain a glimpse into the present mystery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To state at
            least one detail concerning these mysterious <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of God”</span> in plain words: it is from them,
            these Brahmaputras, that the high Dvijas, the initiated Brâhmans
            of old, claimed descent, while the modern Brâhman would have the
            lower castes believe literally that they (the Brâhmans) issued
            direct from the mouth of Brahmâ. Such is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg231"></a> the Esoteric teaching; and it adds moreover
            that, although those descended (spiritually, of course) from the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Will and Yoga”</span> became in
            time divided into opposite sexes, as their <span class="tei tei-q">“Kriyâshakti”</span> progenitors did themselves later
            on; yet even their degenerate descendants have, down to the
            present day, retained a veneration and respect for the creative
            function, and still regard it in the light of a religious
            ceremony, whereas the more civilized nations consider it as a
            mere animal function. Compare the Western views and practice in
            these matters with the Institutions of Manu, in regard to the
            laws of Grihastha, or married life. The true Brâhman is, thus,
            indeed <span class="tei tei-q">“he whose seven forefathers have
            drunk the juice of the Moon-plant (Soma),”</span> and who is a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Trisuparna,”</span> for he has
            understood the secret of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, to this
            day, such Brâhmans know that, during the early beginnings of this
            Race, psychic and physical intellect being dormant and
            consciousness still undeveloped, its spiritual conceptions were
            quite unconnected with its physical surroundings; that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em> man dwelt in his
            animal—though externally human—form; that, if there was instinct
            in him, no self-consciousness came to enlighten the darkness of
            the latent Fifth Principle. When the Lords of Wisdom, moved by
            the law of evolution, infused into him the spark of
            consciousness, the first feeling it awoke to life and activity
            was a sense of solidarity, of one-ness with his spiritual
            creators. As the child's first feeling is for its mother and
            nurse, so the first aspirations of the awakening consciousness in
            primitive man were for those whose element he felt within
            himself, and who were yet outside, and independent of him.
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Devotion</span></em> arose out of that
            feeling, and became the first and foremost motor in his nature;
            for it is the only one which is natural in his heart, which is
            innate in him, and which we find alike in the human babe and the
            young of the animal. This feeling of irrepressible, instinctive
            aspiration in primitive man is beautifully, and one may say
            intuitionally, described by Carlyle, who exclaims:</p>

            divine power in man. It was a child of pure spirit, mentally
            unalloyed with any tincture of earthly element. Its physical
            frame alone was of time and of life, for it drew its intelligence
            direct from above. It was the Living Tree of Divine Wisdom; and
            may therefore be likened to the Mundane Tree of the Norse
            Legends, which cannot wither and die until the last battle of
            life shall be fought, while its roots are all the time gnawed by
            the dragon Nidhogg. For even so, the first and holy Son of
            Kriyâshakti had his body gnawed by the tooth of time, but the
            roots of his inner being remained for ever undecaying and strong,
            because they grew and expanded in heaven, and not on earth. He
            was the first of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em>, and he was the Seed of
            all the others. There were other Sons of Kriyâshakti produced by
            a second spiritual effort, but the first one has remained to this
            day the Seed of Divine Knowledge, the One and the Supreme among
            the terrestrial <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of Wisdom.”</span>
            Of this subject we can say no more, except to add that in every

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nucleole</span></em> of the superior Divine
            World. They are the Formless Fiery Breaths, identical in one
            aspect with the upper Sephirothal Triad, which is placed by the
            Kabalists in the Archetypal World.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
            Hierarchy, with the same numbers, is found in the Japanese
            system, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Beginnings,”</span> as
            taught by both the Shinto and the Buddhist sects. In this system,
            Anthropogenesis precedes Cosmogenesis, as the divine merges into
            the human, and creates—midway in its descent into matter—the
            visible Universe; the legendary personages, remarks reverentially
            Omoie, <span class="tei tei-q">“having to be understood as the
            stereotyped embodiment of the higher [secret] doctrine, and its
            sublime truths.”</span> To state this old system at full length
            would occupy too much of our space; a few words on it, however,
            cannot be out of place. The following is a short synopsis of this
            Anthropo-Cosmogenesis, and shows how closely the most separated
            nations echoed one and the same archaic teaching.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When all was
            as yet Chaos (Kon-ton), three spiritual Beings appeared on the
            stage of future creation: (1) Ame no ani naka nushi no Kami,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Monarch of the Central
            Heaven”</span>; (2) Taka mi onosubi no Kami, <span class="tei tei-q">“Exalted, Imperial Divine Offspring of Heaven and
            Earth”</span>; and (3) Kamu mi musubi no Kami, <span class="tei tei-q">“Offspring of the Gods,”</span> simply.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These were
            without form or substance—our Arûpa Triad—as neither the
            celestial nor the terrestrial substance had yet differentiated,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“nor had the essence of things been
            formed.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) In
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>—which, as now arranged
            and reëdited by Moses de Leon, with the help of Syrian and
            Chaldean Christian Gnostics, in the XIIIth century, and corrected
            and revised still later by many Christian hands, is only a little
            less exoteric than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> itself—this <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine [Vehicle]”</span> no longer appears as it
            does in the Chaldean <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Numbers</span></span>. True enough,
            Ain Suph, the Absolute Endless No-thing, uses also the form of
            the One, the manifested <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly
            Man”</span> (the First Cause), as its Chariot (Mercabah, in
            Hebrew; Vâhana, in Sanskrit) or Vehicle, to descend into, and
            manifest itself in, the phenomenal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg235"></a> world. But the Kabalists neither make it
            plain how the Absolute can use anything, or exercise any
            attribute whatever, since, as the Absolute, it is devoid of
            attributes; nor do they explain that in reality it is the First
            Cause (Plato's Logos), the original and eternal Idea, that
            manifests through Adam Kadmon, the Second Logos, so to speak. In
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Numbers</span></span>, it is
            explained that Ain (En, or Aiôr) is the only self-existent,
            whereas its <span class="tei tei-q">“Depth,”</span> the Bythos of
            the Gnostics, called Propatôr, is only periodical. The latter is
            Brahmâ, as differentiated from Brahman or Parabrahman. It is the
            Depth, the Source of Light, or Propatôr, which is the
            Unmanifested Logos, or the abstract Idea, and not Ain Suph, whose
            Ray uses Adam Kadmon—<span class="tei tei-q">“male and
            female”</span>—or the Manifested Logos, the objective Universe,
            as a Chariot, through which to manifest. But in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>
            we read the following incongruity: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Senior occultatus est, et absconditus;
            Microprosopus manifestus est, et non
            manifestus</span></span>.”</span><a href="#note_344" id="noteref_344" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a>
            This is a fallacy, since Microprosopus, or the Microcosm, can
            only exist during its manifestations, and is destroyed during the
            Mahâpralayas. Rosenroth's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabbala</span></span> is no guide, but very
            often a puzzle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First
            Order</span></span> are the Divine. As in the Japanese system, in
            the Egyptian, and every old cosmogony—at this divine Flame, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“One,”</span> are lit the Three
            descending Groups. Having their potential being in the higher
            Group, they now become distinct and separate Entities. These are
            called the Virgins of Life, the Great Illusion, etc., etc., and
            collectively the six-pointed star. The latter, in almost every
            religion, is the symbol of the Logos as the first emanation. It
            is the sign of Vishnu in India, the Chakra, or Wheel; and the
            glyph of the Tetragrammaton, <span class="tei tei-q">“He of the
            Four Letters,”</span> in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>,
            or metaphorically the <span class="tei tei-q">“Limbs of
            Microprosopus,”</span> which are ten and six respectively.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The later
            Kabalists, however, especially the Christian Mystics, have played
            sad havoc with this magnificent symbol. Indeed, the
            Microprosopus—who is, philosophically speaking, quite distinct
            from the unmanifested eternal Logos, <span class="tei tei-q">“one
            with the Father”</span>—has finally been brought, by centuries of
            incessant efforts of sophistry and of paradoxes, to be considered
            as one with Jehovah, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> living God (!), whereas
            Jehovah is no better than Binah, a female Sephira. This fact
            cannot be too frequently impressed upon the reader. For the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Ten Limbs”</span> of the Heavenly Man
            are the ten Sephiroth; but the first Heavenly Man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg236"></a> is the unmanifested Spirit of
            the Universe, and ought never to be degraded into Microprosopus,
            the Lesser Face or Countenance, the prototype of man on the
            terrestrial plane. The Microprosopus is, as just said, the Logos
            manifested, and of such there are many. Of this, however, later
            on. The six-pointed star refers to the six Forces or Powers of
            Nature, the six planes, principles, etc., etc., all synthesized
            by the seventh, or the central point in the star. All these, the
            upper and lower Hierarchies included, emanate from the Heavenly
            or Celestial Virgin, the Great Mother in all religions, the
            Androgyne, the Sephira Adam Kadmon. Sephira is the Crown, Kether,
            in the abstract principle only, as a mathematical x, the unknown
            quantity. On the plane of differentiated nature, she is the
            female counterpart of Adam Kadmon, the first Androgyne. The
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> teaches that the words
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Fiat
            Lux</span></span>”</span><a href="#note_345" id="noteref_345" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a>
            referred to the formation and evolution of the Sephiroth, and not
            to light as opposed to darkness. Rabbi Simeon says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">O companions, companions, man as an emanation
            was both man and woman, Adam Kadmon verily, and this is the sense
            of the words,</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Let there
            be Light, and there was Light.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">And
            this is the two-fold man.</span><a href="#note_346" id="noteref_346" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In its Unity,
            Primordial Light is the seventh, or highest, principle,
            Daiviprakriti, the Light of the Unmanifested Logos. But in its
            differentiation, it becomes Fohat, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Sons.”</span> The former is symbolized by the
            central point in the Double Triangle; the latter by the Hexagon
            itself, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Six Limbs”</span> of
            Microprosopus, the Seventh being Malkuth, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Bride”</span> of the Christian Kabalists, or our
            Earth. Hence the expressions:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The first after the
            One is Divine Fire; the second, Fire and Ether; the third is

            Water, and Air. The One is not concerned with Man-bearing Globes,
            but with the inner, invisible Spheres. The First-Born are
            the</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Life</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the Heart and Pulse

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These Elements
            of Fire, Air, etc., are not our compound elements; and this
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Consciousness”</span> has no relation to
            our consciousness. The Consciousness of the <span class="tei tei-q">“One Manifested,”</span> if not absolute, is still
            unconditioned. Mahat, the Universal Mind, is the first production
            of the Brahmâ-Creator, but also of Pradhâna, Undifferentiated
            Matter.</p>

            The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Second Order</span></span> of Celestial
            Beings, those of Fire and Ether, corresponding to Spirit and
            Soul, or Âtmâ-Buddhi, whose names are legion, are still formless,
            but more definitely <span class="tei tei-q">“substantial.”</span>

            the first differentiation in the Secondary Evolution or
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation”</span>—a misleading word. As
            the name shows, they are the Prototypes of the incarnating Jîvas
            or Monads, and are composed of the Fiery Spirit of Life. It is
            through these that passes, like a pure solar beam, the Ray which
            is furnished by them with its future Vehicle, the Divine Soul,
            Buddhi. These are directly concerned with the Hosts of the higher
            World of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> System. From these Two-fold
            Units emanate the <span class="tei tei-q">“Three-fold.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
            cosmogony of Japan, when, out of the chaotic mass, an egg-like
            nucleus appears, having within itself the germ and potency of all
            universal as well as of all terrestrial life, it is the
            Three-fold just named, which differentiate. The male ethereal
            principle (Yo) ascends, and the female grosser or more material
            principle (In) is precipitated into the universe of substance,
            when a separation occurs between the celestial and the
            terrestrial. From this, the female, the Mother, the first
            rudimentary objective being is born. It is ethereal, without form
            or sex, and yet it is from it and the Mother that the Seven
            Divine Spirits are born, from whom will emanate the seven
            <span class="tei tei-q">“creations”</span>; just as in the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Codex

            the seven <span class="tei tei-q">“evilly disposed”</span>
            (material) spirits are born. It would be too long to give here
            the Japanese names, but in translation they stand in this
            order:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.) The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Invisible Celibate,”</span> which is the
            Creative Logos of the non-creating <span class="tei tei-q">“Father,”</span> or the creative potentiality of the
            latter made manifest.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.) The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit [or God] of the rayless Depths
            [Chaos],”</span> which becomes differentiated matter, or the
            world-stuff; also the mineral realm.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3.) The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of the Vegetable Kingdom,”</span>
            of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Abundant Vegetation.”</span></p>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of the Earth”</span> and
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the Spirit of the Sands”</span>; a Being
            of dual nature, the former containing the potentiality of the
            male element, the latter that of the female element. These two
            were one, as yet unconscious of being two.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>)
            The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fourth Order</span></span> are substantial
            Entities. This is the highest Group among the Rûpas (Atomic
            Forms). It is the nursery of the human, conscious, spiritual
            Souls. They are called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Imperishable
            Jîvas,”</span> and constitute, through the Order below their own,
            the first Group of the first Septenary Host—the great mystery of
            human, conscious and intellectual Being. For the latter is the
            field wherein lies concealed, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in its
            privation</span></em>, the Germ that will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fall into
            generation</span></em>. That Germ will become the spiritual
            potency in the physical cell, that guides the development of the
            embryo, and that is the cause of the hereditary transmission of
            faculties, and all the inherent qualities in man. The Darwinian
            theory, however, of the transmission of acquired faculties is
            neither taught nor accepted in Occultism. Evolution, in the
            latter, proceeds on quite other lines; the physical, according to
            Esoteric teaching, evolving gradually from the spiritual, mental,
            and psychic. This inner soul of the physical cell—the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“spiritual plasm”</span> that dominates
            the germinal plasm—is the key that must open one day the gates of
            the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">terra incognita</span></span> of the
            Biologist, now called the dark mystery of Embryology. It is
            worthy of notice that Modern Chemistry, while rejecting, as a
            superstition of Occultism and Religion as well, the theory of
            substantial and invisible Beings, called Angels, Elementals,
            etc.—without, of course, having ever looked into the philosophy
            of these incorporeal Entities, or thought over them—should, owing
            to observation and discovery, have been unconsciously forced to
            recognize and adopt the same ratio of progression and order, in
            the evolution of chemical atoms, as Occultism does for both its
            Dhyânis and Atoms—analogy being its first law. As seen above, the
            very first Group of the Rûpa Angels is quaternary, an element
            being added to each in descending order. So also are the atoms,
            in the phraseology of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
            239]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg239"></a>
            Chemistry, monatomic, diatomic, triatomic, tetratomic, etc.,
            progressing downwards.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let it be
            remembered that the Fire, Water, and Air of Occultism, or the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Elements of Primary Creation”</span>
            so-called, are not the compound elements they are on earth, but
            noumenal homogeneous Elements—the Spirits of the former. Then
            follow the Septenary Groups or Hosts. Placed on parallel lines
            with the atoms in a diagram, the natures of these Beings would be
            seen to correspond, in their downward scale of progression, to
            composite elements in a mathematically identical manner as to
            analogy. This refers, of course, only to diagrams made by
            Occultists; for were the scale of Angelic Beings to be placed on
            parallel lines with the scale of the chemical atoms of
            Science—from the hypothetical Helium down to Uranium—they would
            of course be found to differ. For the latter have, as
            correspondents on the Astral Plane, only the four lowest
            orders—the three higher principles in the atom, or rather
            molecule, or chemical element, being perceptible to the initiated
            Dangma's eye alone. But then, if Chemistry desired to find itself
            on the right path, it would have to correct its tabular
            arrangement by that of the Occultists—which it might refuse to
            do. In Esoteric Philosophy, every physical particle corresponds
            to, and depends on, its higher noumenon—the Being to whose
            essence it belongs; and, above as below, the Spiritual evolves
            from the Divine, the Psycho-mental from the Spiritual—tainted
            from its lower plane by the Astral—the whole animate and
            (seemingly) inanimate Nature evolving on parallel lines, and
            drawing its attributes from above as well as below.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The number
            seven, as applied to the term Septenary Host, above mentioned,
            does not imply only seven Entities, but seven Groups or Hosts, as
            explained before. The highest Group, the Asuras born in Brahmâ's
            first body, which turned into <span class="tei tei-q">“Night,”</span> are septenary, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            divided like the Pitris into seven Classes, three of which are
            bodiless (arûpa) and four with bodies.<a href="#note_347" id="noteref_347" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>
            They are in fact more truly our Pitris (Ancestors) than the
            Pitris who projected the first physical man.</p>

            The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fifth Order</span></span> is a very
            mysterious one, as it is connected with the microcosmic pentagon,
            the five-pointed star, representing man. In India and Egypt,
            these Dhyânis were connected with the Crocodile, and their abode
            is in Capricornus. But these are convertible terms in Indian
            Astrology, for the tenth sign of the Zodiac, which is called
            Makara, is loosely translated <span class="tei tei-q">“Crocodile.”</span> The word itself is occultly
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg240"></a> interpreted in
            various ways, as will be shown further on. In Egypt, the
            Defunct—whose symbol is the pentagram, or the five-pointed star,
            the points of which represent the limbs of a man—was shown
            emblematically transformed into a crocodile. Sebekh, or Sevekh
            (or <span class="tei tei-q">“Seventh”</span>), as Mr. Gerald
            Massey says, showing it to be the type of intelligence, is a
            dragon in reality, not a crocodile. He is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dragon of Wisdom,”</span> or Manas, the Human Soul,
            Mind, the Intelligent Principle, called in our Esoteric

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg241"></a> Egyptian religious
            glyph is easy. The crocodile is the first to await and meet the
            devouring fires of the morning sun, and very soon came to
            personify the solar heat. When the sun arose, it was like the
            arrival on earth, and among men, of the <span class="tei tei-q">“divine soul which informs the Gods.”</span> Hence
            the strange symbolism. The mummy donned the head of a crocodile
            to show that it was a Soul arriving from the earth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all the
            ancient papyri, the crocodile is called Sebekh (Seventh); water
            also symbolizes the fifth principle esoterically; and, as already
            stated, Mr. Gerald Massey shows that the crocodile was the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“seventh Soul, the supreme one of
            seven—the Seer unseen.”</span> Even exoterically Sekhem is the
            residence of the God Khem, and Khem is Horus avenging the death
            of his father Osiris, hence punishing the sins of man, when he
            becomes a disembodied Soul. Thus the defunct Osirified became the
            God Khem, who <span class="tei tei-q">“gleans the field of
            Aanroo”</span>; that is, he gleans either his reward or
            punishment, for that field is the celestial locality (Devachan),
            where the Defunct is given <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wheat</span></em>, the food of divine
            justice. The Fifth Group of Celestial Beings is supposed to
            contain in itself the dual attributes of both the spiritual and
            physical aspects of the Universe; the two poles, so to say, of
            Mahat, the Universal Intelligence, and the dual nature of man,
            the spiritual and the physical. Hence its number Five, doubled
            and made into Ten, connecting it with Makara, the tenth sign of
            the Zodiac.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>)
            The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sixth</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seventh
            Orders</span></span> partake of the lower qualities of the
            Quaternary. They are conscious ethereal Entities, as invisible as
            Ether, which are shot out, like the boughs of a tree, from the
            first central Group of the Four, and shoot out in their turn
            numberless side Groups, the lower of which are the
            Nature-Spirits, or Elementals, of countless kinds and varieties;
            from the formless and unsubstantial—the ideal Thoughts of their
            creators—down to atomic, though, to human perception, invisible
            organisms. The latter are considered as the <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits of atoms,”</span> for they are the first
            remove (backwards) from the physical atom—sentient, if not
            intelligent creatures. They are all subject to Karma, and have to
            work it out through every cycle. For, as the Doctrine teaches,
            there are no such privileged Beings in the Universe, whether in
            our own or in other Systems, in the outer or the inner
            Worlds,<a href="#note_351" id="noteref_351" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> as
            the Angels of the Western Religion and the Judean. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg242"></a> A Dhyân Chohan has to become
            one; he cannot be born or appear suddenly on the plane of life as
            a full-blown Angel. The Celestial Hierarchy of the present
            Manvantara will find itself transferred, in the next Circle of
            Life, into higher superior Worlds, and will make room for a new
            Hierarchy, composed of the elect ones of our mankind. Being is an
            endless cycle within the One Absolute Eternity, wherein move
            numberless inner cycles finite and conditioned. Gods, created as
            such, would evince no personal merit in being Gods. Such a class
            of Beings—perfect only by virtue of the special immaculate nature
            inherent in them—in the face of suffering and struggling
            humanity, and even of the lower creation, would be the symbol of
            an eternal injustice quite Satanic in character, an ever present
            crime. It is an anomaly and an impossibility in Nature. Therefore
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Four”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Three”</span> have to incarnate as all other beings
            have. This Sixth Group, moreover, remains almost inseparable from
            man, who draws from it all but his highest and lowest principles,
            or his spirit and body; the five middle human principles being
            the very essence of those Dhyânis. Paracelsus calls them the
            Flagæ; the Christians, the Guardian Angels; the Occultists, the
            Ancestors, the Pitris. They are the Six-fold Dhyân Chohans,
            having the six spiritual Elements in the composition of their
            bodies—in fact, men, minus the physical body.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alone, the
            Divine Ray, the Âtman, proceeds directly from the One. When asked
            how this can be? How is it possible to conceive that these
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> or Angels, can be at the
            same time their own emanations and their personal selves? Is it
            in the same sense as in the material world, where the son is, in
            one way, his father, being his blood, the bone of his bone and
            the flesh of his flesh? To this the Teachers answer: Verily it is
            so. But one has to go deep into the mystery of Being, before one
            can fully comprehend this truth.</p>

            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg243"></a> through successive
            generations. How, then, can this be explained? By resorting to a
            simile, to a familiar illustration, though necessarily imperfect,
            as all our available analogies must be. Before resorting to it,
            however, I would ask, whether it seems unnatural, least of all
            <span class="tei tei-q">“supernatural,”</span> to any one of us,
            when we consider the process of the growth and development of a
            fœtus into a healthy baby weighing several pounds? Evolving from
            what? From the segmentation of an infinitesimally small ovum and
            a spermatozoön! And afterwards we see the baby develop into a
            six-foot man! This refers to the atomic and physical expansion,
            from the microscopically small into something exceedingly large;
            from the unseen, to the naked eye, into the visible and
            objective. Science has provided for all this; and, I dare say,
            her theories, embryological, biological and physiological, are
            correct enough, so far as exact observation of the material goes.
            Nevertheless, the two chief difficulties of the science of
            Embryology—namely, what are the forces at work in the formation
            of the fœtus, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em> of <span class="tei tei-q">“hereditary transmission”</span> of likeness,
            physical, moral or mental—have never been properly answered; nor
            will they ever be solved, till the day when Scientists condescend
            to accept the Occult theories. But if this physical phenomenon
            astonishes no one, except in so far as it puzzles the
            Embryologists, why should our intellectual and inner growth, the
            evolution of the Human-Spiritual to the Divine-Spiritual, be
            regarded as, or seem, more impossible than the other?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            Materialists and the Evolutionists of the Darwinian school would
            be ill-advised to accept the newly worked-out theories of
            Professor Weissmann, the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beiträge zur
            Descendenzlehre</span></span>, with regard to one of the two
            mysteries of Embryology, as above specified, which he seems to
            think he has solved; for, when it is fully solved, Science will
            have stepped into the domain of the truly Occult, and passed for
            ever out of the realm of transformation, as taught by Darwin. The
            two theories are irreconcilable, from the standpoint of
            Materialism. Regarded from that of the Occultists, however, the
            new theory solves all these mysteries. Those who are not
            acquainted with the discovery of Professor Weissmann—at one time
            a fervent Darwinist—ought to hasten to repair the deficiency. The
            German embryologist-philosopher—stepping over the heads of the
            Greek Hippocrates and Aristotle, right back into the teachings of
            the old Âryans—shows one infinitesimal cell, out of millions of

            psychic characteristics. It is this cell which impresses on the
            face and form of the new individual the features of the parents,
            or of some distant ancestor; it is this cell, again, which
            transmits to him the intellectual and mental idiosyncracies of
            his sires, and so on. This Plasm is the immortal portion of our
            bodies, developing by means of a process of successive
            assimilations. Darwin's theory, viewing the embryological cell as
            the essence or extract from all other cells, is set aside; it is
            incapable of accounting for hereditary transmission. There are
            but two ways of explaining the mystery of heredity: either the
            substance of the germinal cell is endowed with the faculty of
            crossing the whole cycle of transformations that lead to the
            construction of a separate organism, and then to the reproduction
            of identical germinal cells; or, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">these germinal
            cells do not have their genesis at all in the body of the
            individual, but proceed directly from the ancestral germinal cell
            passed from father to son through long generations</span></span>.
            It is the latter hypothesis that Weissmann has adopted and worked
            upon, and it is to this cell that he traces the immortal portion
            of man. So far, so good; and when this almost correct theory is
            accepted, how will Biologists explain the first appearance of
            this everlasting cell? Unless man <span class="tei tei-q">“grew”</span> like the immortal <span class="tei tei-q">“Topsy,”</span> and was not born at all, but fell
            from the clouds, how was that embryological cell generated in
            him?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It comes to
            this: Mankind, in its first prototypal, shadowy form, is the
            offspring of the Elohim of Life, or Pitris; in its qualitative
            and physical aspect, it is the direct progeny of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ancestors,”</span> the lowest Dhyânis, or Spirits of
            the Earth; for its moral, psychic and spiritual nature, it is
            indebted to a Group of divine Beings, the name and
            characteristics of which will be given in Volume II.
            Collectively, men are the handiwork of Hosts of various Spirits;
            distributively, the tabernacles of those Hosts; and occasionally
            and individually, the vehicles of some of them. In our present
            all-material Fifth Race, the earthly Spirit of the Fourth is
            still strong in us; but we are approaching the time when the
            pendulum of evolution will direct its swing decidedly upwards,
            bringing Humanity back on a parallel line with the primitive
            Third Root-Race in spirituality. During its childhood, mankind
            was wholly composed of that Angelic Host, who were the indwelling
            Spirits that animated the monstrous and gigantic tabernacles of
            clay of the Fourth Race, built by and composed of countless
            myriads of Lives, as our bodies are also now. This sentence will
            be explained later on in the present Commentary. Science, dimly
            perceiving the truth, may find bacteria and other infinitesimals
            in the human body, and see in them only occasional and abnormal
            visitors, to which diseases are attributed. Occultism—which
            discerns a Life in every atom and molecule, whether in a mineral
            or human body, in air, fire or water—affirms that our whole body
            is built of such Lives; the smallest bacterium under the
            microscope being to them in comparative size like an elephant to
            the tiniest infusoria.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            <span class="tei tei-q">“tabernacles”</span> mentioned above have
            improved in texture and symmetry of form, growing and developing
            with the Globe that bears them; but the physical improvement has
            taken place at the expense of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg246"></a> the spiritual Inner Man and of Nature. The
            three middle principles, in earth and man, became with every Race
            more material; the Soul stepping back to make room for the
            Physical Intellect; the essence of the Elements becoming the
            material and composite elements now known.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man is not,
            nor could he ever be, the complete product of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord God”</span>; but he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>
            the child of the Elohim, so arbitrarily changed into the singular
            number and masculine gender. The first Dhyânis, commissioned to
            <span class="tei tei-q">“create”</span> man in their image, could
            only throw off their Shadows, as a delicate model for the Nature
            Spirits of matter to work upon. Man is, beyond any doubt, formed
            physically out of the dust of the Earth, but his creators and
            fashioners were many. Nor can it be said that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord God breathed into his nostrils the Breath of
            Life,”</span> unless that God is identified with the <span class="tei tei-q">“One Life,”</span> omnipresent though invisible, and
            unless the same operation is attributed to <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> on behalf of every <span class="tei tei-q">“Living Soul,”</span> which is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Vital</span></em>
            Soul (Nephesh), and not the Divine Spirit (Ruach) which ensures
            to man alone a divine degree of immortality, that no animal, as
            such, could ever attain in this cycle of incarnation. It is owing
            to the inadequate distinctions made by the Jews, and now by our
            Western metaphysicians, who are unable to understand, and hence
            to accept, more than a triune man—Spirit, Soul, Body—that the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath of Life”</span> has been confused
            with the immortal <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit.”</span> This
            applies also directly to the Protestant theologians, who in
            translating a certain verse in the Fourth Gospel<a href="#note_356" id="noteref_356" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a>
            have entirely perverted its meaning. This mistranslation runs,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wind</span></em>
            bloweth where it listeth,”</span> instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span></em> goeth where it
            willeth,”</span> as in the original, and also in the translation
            of the Greek Eastern Church.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The learned
            and very philosophical author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Aspects of
            Life</span></span> would impress upon his reader that the Nephesh
            Chiah (Living Soul), according to the Hebrews:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Proceeded from, or was produced by, the infusion
            of the Spirit or Breath of Life into the quickening body of man,
            and was to supersede and take the place of that Spirit in the
            thus constituted Self, so that the Spirit passed into, was lost
            sight of, and disappeared in the Living Soul.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The human
            body, he thinks, ought to be viewed as a matrix in which, and
            from which, the Soul, which he seems to place higher than the
            Spirit, is developed. Considered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">functionally</span></em> and from the
            standpoint <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
            247]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg247"></a>
            of activity, the Soul stands undeniably higher, in this finite
            and conditioned world of Mâyâ. The Soul, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is ultimately produced from the animated body of
            man.”</span> Thus the author identifies <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit”</span> (Âtmâ) with the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath of Life”</span> simply. The Eastern
            Occultists will demur to this statement, for it is based on the
            erroneous conception that Prâna and Âtmâ, or Jîvâtmâ, are one and
            the same thing. The author supports the argument, by showing that
            with the ancient Hebrews, Greeks, and even Latins, Ruach, Pneuma
            and Spiritus meant Wind—with the Jews undeniably, and with the
            Greeks and Romans very probably; the Greek word Anemos (Wind) and
            the Latin Animus (Soul) having a suspicious relation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is very
            far fetched. But a legitimate battle-field for deciding this
            question is hardly to be found, since Dr. Pratt seems to be a
            practical, matter-of-fact metaphysician, a kind of
            Kabalist-Positivist, whereas the Eastern metaphysicians,
            especially the Vedântins, are all Idealists. The Occultists also
            are of the extreme Esoteric Vedântin school, and though they call
            the One Life (Parabrahman) the Great Breath and the Whirlwind,
            they disconnect the seventh principle entirely from matter, and
            deny that it has any relation to, or connection with it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
            philosophy of man's psychic, spiritual and mental relations with
            his physical functions is in almost inextricable confusion.
            Neither the old Âryan nor the Egyptian psychology is now properly
            understood; nor can they be assimilated, without accepting the
            Esoteric septenary, or, at any rate, the Vedântic quinquepartite
            division of the human inner principles. Failing which, it will be
            for ever impossible to understand the metaphysical and purely
            psychic, and even physiological, relations between the Dhyân
            Chohans, or Angels, on the one plane, and Humanity on the other.
            No Eastern (Âryan) Esoteric works are so far published, but we
            possess the Egyptian papyri, which speak clearly of the seven
            principles, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Souls of
            Man.”</span> The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the Dead</span></span> gives a
            complete list of the <span class="tei tei-q">“transformations”</span> that every Defunct
            undergoes, while divesting himself, one by one, of all these
            principles—materialized for the sake of clearness into ethereal
            entities or bodies. We must, moreover, remind those who try to
            show that the Ancient Egyptians did not teach Reïncarnation, that
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul”</span> (the Ego or Self) of
            the Defunct is said to be living in Eternity: it is immortal,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“coëval with, and disappearing with, the
            Solar Boat,”</span> that is, for the Cycle of Necessity. This
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emerges</span></em> from the Tiaou, the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like alone
            produces like. The Earth gives Man his body, the Gods (Dhyânis)
            give him his five inner principles, the psychic Shadow, of which
            these Gods are often the animating principle. Spirit (Âtman) is

            Dead</span></span> contains a mystery. Tiaou is the path of the
            Night-Sun, the inferior hemisphere, or the infernal region of the
            Egyptians, placed by them on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concealed side of
            the Moon</span></em>. The human being, in their Esotericism, came
            out from the Moon—a triple mystery, astronomical, physiological
            and psychical, at once; he crossed the whole cycle of existence,
            and then returned to his birth-place, before issuing from it
            again. Thus the Defunct is shown arriving in the West, receiving
            his judgment before Osiris, resurrecting as the God Horus, and
            circling round the sidereal heavens, which is an allegorical
            assimilation to Ra, the Sun; then having crossed the Noot, the
            Celestial Abyss, returning once more to Tiaou; an assimilation to
            Osiris, who, as the God of life <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg249"></a> and reproduction, inhabits the Moon.

            is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“O Osiris-Lunus, that renews to
            thee thy renewal.”</span> And Sabekh says to Seti I:<a href="#note_363" id="noteref_363" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Thou renewest thyself as the God Lunus,
            when a babe.”</span> It is still better explained in a Louvre
            papyrus:<a href="#note_364" id="noteref_364" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Couplings and conceptions abound when he
            [Osiris-Lunus] is seen in heaven on that day.”</span> Says
            Osiris: <span class="tei tei-q">“O sole radiant beam of the Moon!
            I issue from the circulating multitudes [of stars].... Open me
            the Tiaou, for Osiris N. I will issue by day to do what I have to
            do amongst the living”</span><a href="#note_365" id="noteref_365" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            to produce conceptions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Osiris was
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God manifest in generation,”</span>
            because the ancients knew, far better than the moderns, the real
            occult influences of the lunar body upon the mysteries of
            conception. In the oldest systems we find the Moon always male.
            Thus Soma, with the Hindûs, is a kind of sidereal Don Juan, a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“King,”</span> and the father, albeit
            illegitimate, of Budha—Wisdom. This relates to Occult Knowledge,
            a wisdom gathered through a thorough acquaintance with lunar
            mysteries, including those of sexual generation. And later, when
            the Moon became connected with the female Goddesses, with Diana,
            Isis, Artemis, Juno, etc., this connection was also due to a
            thorough knowledge of physiology and female nature, physical as
            much as psychic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, instead of
            being taught in Sunday Schools useless lessons from the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, the armies of the
            ragged and poor were taught Astrology—so far, at any rate, as the
            occult properties of the Moon and its hidden influences on
            generation are concerned—then, there would be little need to fear
            increase of the population, or to resort to the questionable
            literature of the Malthusians for its arrest. For it is the Moon
            and her conjunctions that regulate conceptions, and every
            Astrologer in India knows it. During the previous Races, and at
            least at the beginning of the present one, those who indulged in
            marital relations during certain lunar phases that made those
            relations sterile, were regarded as sorcerers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg250"></a> and sinners. But now even
            these sins of old, which arose from the abuse of Occult
            knowledge, would appear preferable to the crimes of to-day, which
            are perpetrated because of the complete ignorance of such Occult
            influences.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But,
            primarily, the Sun and Moon were the only visible and, by their
            effects, so to say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">tangible</span></em>, psychic and
            physiological deities—the Father and the Son—while Space or Air
            in general, or that expanse of heaven called Noot by the
            Egyptians, was the concealed Spirit or Breath of the two. The
            Father and Son were interchangeable in their functions, and
            worked together harmoniously in their effects upon terrestrial
            nature and humanity; hence they were regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>,
            though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> as personified Entities.
            They were both males, and both had their distinct though
            collaborative work in the causative generation of humanity. So
            much from the astronomical and cosmic standpoints, viewed and
            expressed in symbolical language, which became in our last races
            theological and dogmatic. But behind this veil of cosmic and
            astrological symbols, there were the occult mysteries of
            anthropography and the primeval genesis of man. And in this, no
            knowledge of symbols, or even the key to the post-diluvian
            symbolical language of the Jews, will or can help, save only with
            reference to that which has been laid down in national scriptures
            for exoteric uses; the sum of which, however cleverly veiled, was
            but the smallest portion of the real primitive history of each
            people, and often, moreover, as in the Hebrew Scriptures, related
            merely to the terrestrial human, and not to the divine life of
            that nation. That psychic and spiritual element belonged to the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Mysteries</span></span> and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Initiation</span></span>. There were
            things never recorded in scrolls, but which, as in Central Asia,
            were engraved on rocks and in subterranean crypts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
            there was a time when the whole world was <span class="tei tei-q">“of one lip and of one knowledge,”</span> and man
            knew more of his origin than he does now; and thus knew that the
            Sun and Moon, however large a part they may play in the
            constitution, growth and development of the human body, were not
            the direct causative agents of his appearance on Earth; for these
            agents, in truth, are the living and intelligent Powers which the
            Occultists call Dhyân Chohans.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to this, a
            very learned admirer of the Jewish Esotericism tells us that:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this the
            Eastern Occultist replies: Quite so; they are an abstraction to
            our physical senses. To our spiritual perceptions, however, and
            to our inner spiritual eye, the Elohim, or Dhyânis, are no more
            an abstraction than our soul and spirit are to us. Reject the one
            and you reject the other, since that which is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">surviving</span></em> Entity <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
            us</span></em>, is partly the direct emanation from, and partly
            those celestial Entities <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">themselves</span></em>. One thing is
            certain; the Jews were perfectly acquainted with sorcery and
            various maleficent forces: but, with the exception of some of
            their great prophets and seers like Daniel and Ezekiel—Enoch
            belonging to a far distant race, as a generic character, and not
            to any nation but to all—they knew little of, nor would they deal
            with, the real divine Occultism; their national character being
            averse to anything which had no direct bearing upon their own
            ethnical, tribal and individual benefits—witness their own
            prophets, and the curses thundered by them against the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“stiff-necked race.”</span> But even the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> plainly shows the
            direct relation between the Sephiroth, or Elohim, and men.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore,
            when it is proved to us that the Kabalistic identification of
            Jehovah with Binah, a female Sephira, has still another, a
            sub-occult, meaning in it, then and then only will Occultists be
            ready to pass the palm of perfection to the Kabalist. Until then,
            it is asserted that, as Jehovah, in the abstract sense of a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“one living God,”</span> is a single
            number, a metaphysical figment, and a reality only when put in
            his proper place as an emanation and a Sephira—we have a right to
            maintain that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, as witnessed by the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
            Numbers</span></span>, at any rate, gave out originally, before
            the Christian Kabalists had disfigured it, and still gives out,
            the same doctrine that we do; that is, it makes Man emanate, not
            from one Celestial Man, but from a Septenary Group of Celestial
            Men, or Angels, just as in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pymander, the Thought

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
            the Dead</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“Chaos ceases,

            <span class="tei tei-q">“First-born.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Ra [or Osiris-Ptah] creates his own Limbs [like

            Ether.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the
            metaphysical explanation, and refers to the very beginning of
            Evolution, or, as we would rather say, of Theogony. The meaning
            of the Stanza, when explained from another standpoint in its
            reference to the mystery of man and his origin, is still more
            difficult to comprehend. In order to form a clear conception of
            what is meant by the One becoming Two, and then being transformed
            into the Three-fold, the student has to make himself thoroughly
            acquainted with what we call Rounds. If he refers to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
            Buddhism</span></span>—the first attempt to sketch out an
            approximate outline of archaic cosmogony—he will find that by a
            Round is meant the serial evolution of nascent material Nature,
            of the seven Globes of our Chain,<a href="#note_368" id="noteref_368" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">368</span></span></a>
            with their mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms; man being
            included in the latter and standing at the head of it, during the
            whole period of a Life-Cycle, which latter would be called by the
            Brâhmans a <span class="tei tei-q">“Day of Brahmâ.”</span> It is,
            in short, one revolution of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Wheel”</span> (our Planetary Chain), which is
            composed of seven Globes, or seven separate <span class="tei tei-q">“Wheels,”</span> in another sense this time. When
            evolution has run <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg
            253]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg253"></a>
            downward into matter from Globe A to Globe G, it is one Round. In
            the middle of the fourth revolution, which is our present Round,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Evolution has reached its acme of
            physical development, crowned its work with the perfect physical
            man, and, from this point, begins its work spirit-ward.”</span>
            All this needs little repetition, as it is well explained in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>. That which
            was hardly touched upon, however, and of which the little that
            was said has misled many, is the origin of man, and it is upon
            this that a little more light may now be thrown, just enough to
            make the Stanza more comprehensible, as the process will be fully
            explained only in its legitimate place, in Volume II.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now every
            Round, on the descending scale, is but a repetition in a more
            concrete form of the Round which preceded it, just as every
            Globe, down to our Fourth Sphere the actual Earth, is a grosser
            and more material copy of the more shadowy Sphere which precedes
            it, each in order, on the three higher planes.<a href="#note_369" id="noteref_369" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> On
            its way upwards, on the ascending arc, Evolution spiritualizes
            and etherealizes, so to speak, the general nature of all,
            bringing it on to a level with the plane on which the twin Globe
            on the opposite arc is placed; the result being, that when the
            seventh Globe is reached, in whatever Round, the nature of
            everything that is evolving returns to the condition it was in at
            its starting point—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em>, every time, a new and
            superior degree in the states of consciousness. Thus it becomes
            clear that the <span class="tei tei-q">“origin of man,”</span>
            so-called, in this our present Round, or Life-Cycle, on this
            Planet, must occupy the same place in the same order—save details
            based on local conditions and time—as in the preceding Round.
            Again, it must be explained and remembered that, as the work of
            each Round is said to be apportioned to a different Group of
            so-called Creators, or Architects, so is that of every Globe;
            that is, it is under the supervision and guidance of special
            Builders and Watchers—the various Dhyân Chohans.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Creators”</span> is an incorrect word to use, as no
            other religion, not even the sect of the Visishthadvaitîs in
            India, one which anthropomorphizes even Parabrahman, believes in
            creation <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ex nihilo</span></span>, as Christians and
            Jews do, but only in evolution out of preëxisting materials.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Group of
            the Hierarchy which is commissioned to <span class="tei tei-q">“create”</span> men is a special Group, then; yet it
            evolved shadowy man in this Cycle, just as a higher and still
            more spiritual Group evolved him in the Third <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg254"></a> Round. But as it is the
            Sixth, on the downward scale of Spirituality—the last and Seventh
            being the Terrestrial Spirits (Elementals), which gradually form,
            build and condense his physical body—this Sixth Group evolves no
            more than the future man's shadowy form, a filmy, hardly visible,
            transparent copy of themselves. It becomes the task of the Fifth
            Hierarchy—the mysterious Beings that preside over the
            constellation Capricornus, Makara, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Crocodile,”</span> in India and in Egypt—to inform
            the empty and ethereal animal form, and make of it the Rational
            Man. This is one of those subjects upon which very little may be
            said to the general public. It is a Mystery truly, but only to
            him who is prepared to reject the existence of intellectual and
            conscious Spiritual Beings in the Universe, and to limit full
            Consciousness to man alone, and that only as a <span class="tei tei-q">“function of the brain.”</span> Many are those among
            the Spiritual Entities, who have incarnated bodily in man, since
            his first appearance, and who, for all that, still exist as
            independently as they did before, in the infinitudes of
            Space.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To put it more
            clearly, such an invisible Entity may be bodily present on earth
            without, however, abandoning its status and functions in the
            supersensuous regions. If this needs explanation, we can do no
            better than remind the reader of like cases in so-called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism”</span>; though such cases
            are very rare, at least as regards the nature of the Entity
            incarnating, or taking temporary possession of a medium. For the
            so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span> that may
            occasionally possess themselves of the bodies of mediums are not
            the Monads, or Higher Principles, of disembodied Personalities.
            Such <span class="tei tei-q">“spirits”</span> can only be either
            Elementaries, or—Nirmânakâyas. Just as certain persons, whether
            by virtue of a peculiar organization, or through the power of
            acquired mystic knowledge, can be seen in their <span class="tei tei-q">“double”</span> in one place, while their body is
            many miles away; so the same thing can occur in the case of
            superior Beings.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Man,
            philosophically considered, is, in his outward form, simply an
            animal, hardly more perfect than his pithecoid-like ancestor of
            the Third Round. He is a living Body, not a living Being, since
            the realization of existence, the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego Sum</span></span>,”</span> necessitates
            self-consciousness, and an animal can only have direct
            consciousness, or instinct. This was so well understood by the
            ancients, that even the Kabalists made of soul and body two
            Lives, independent of each other. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Aspects of
            Life</span></span>, the author states the Kabalistic
            teaching:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

            of corresponding opacity and</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg255"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">density,
              tended to coalesce; and that the resultant created Spirits, in
              the disembodied state, were constituted on a scale in which the
              differing opacities and transparencies of elemental or
              uncreated Spirit were reproduced. And that these Spirits, in
              the disembodied state, attracted, appropriated, digested and
              assimilated elemental Spirit and elemental Matter whose
              condition was conformed to their own.... They therefore taught
              that there was a wide difference in the conditions of created
              Spirits; and that, in the intimate association between the
              Spirit-world and the world of Matter, the more opaque Spirits,
              in the disembodied state, were drawn towards the more dense
              parts of the material world, and therefore tended towards the
              centre of the Earth, where they found the conditions most
              suited to their state; while the more transparent Spirits
              passed into the surrounding aura of the planet, the most
              rarefied finding their home in its satellite.</span><a href="#note_370" id="noteref_370" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This relates
            exclusively to our Elemental Spirits, and has naught to do with
            either the Planetary, Sidereal, Cosmic or Inter-Etheric
            Intelligent Forces, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Angels”</span> as
            they are termed by the Roman Church. The Jewish Kabalists,
            especially the practical Occultists who dealt with Ceremonial
            Magic, busied themselves solely with the Spirits of the Planets
            and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elementals”</span> so-called.
            Therefore the above covers only a portion of the Esoteric
            teaching.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Soul,
            whose body-vehicle is the astral, ethereo-substantial envelope,
            could die and man be still living on earth. That is to say, the
            Soul could free itself from and quit the tabernacle for various
            reasons, such as insanity, spiritual and physical depravity, etc.
            The possibility of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul”</span>—that
            is, the eternal Spiritual Ego—dwelling in the unseen worlds,
            while its body goes on living on Earth, is a preeminently Occult
            doctrine, especially in Chinese and Buddhist philosophy. Many are
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">soulless</span></em> men among us, for the
            occurrence is found to take place in wicked materialists as well
            as in persons <span class="tei tei-q">“who advance in holiness
            and never turn back.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore,
            that which living men (Initiates) can do, the Dhyânis, who have
            no physical body to hamper them, can do still better. This was
            the belief of the antediluvians, and it is fast becoming that of
            modern intellectual society in <span class="tei tei-q">“Spiritualism,”</span> as well as in the Greek and
            Roman Churches, which teach the ubiquity of their Angels. The
            Zoroastrians regarded their Amshaspends as dual entities
            (Ferouers), applying this duality—in Esoteric philosophy, at any
            rate—to all the spiritual and invisible denizens of the
            numberless worlds in space, which are visible to our eye. In a
            note of Damascius (sixth century) on the Chaldean Oracles, we
            have ample evidence of the universality of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg256"></a> this doctrine, for he says:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“In these Oracles, the seven
            Cosmocratores of the World [<span class="tei tei-q">‘the
            World-Pillars’</span>], mentioned likewise by St. Paul, are
            double; one set being commissioned to rule the superior worlds,
            the spiritual and the sidereal, and the other to guide and watch
            over the worlds of matter.”</span> Such is also the opinion of
            Jamblichus, who makes an evident distinction between the
            Archangels and the Archontes.<a href="#note_371" id="noteref_371" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above may
            be applied, of course, to the distinction made between the
            degrees or orders of Spiritual Beings, and it is in this sense
            that the Roman Catholic Church tries to interpret and teach the
            difference; for while the Archangels are in her teaching divine
            and holy, she denounces their <span class="tei tei-q">“Doubles”</span> as Devils. But the word Ferouer is
            not to be understood in this sense, for it means simply the
            reverse or the opposite side of some attribute or quality. Thus
            when the Occultist says that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Demon
            is the inverse of God”</span>—evil, the reverse of the medal—he
            does not mean two separate actualities, but two aspects or facets
            of the same Unity. But the best man living, side by side with an
            Archangel—as described in Theology—would appear a fiend. Hence a
            certain reason in depreciating a lower <span class="tei tei-q">“Double,”</span> immersed far deeper in matter than
            its original. But still there is as little cause to regard them
            as Devils, and this is precisely what the Roman Catholics
            maintain against all reason and logic.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This identity
            between the Spirit and its material <span class="tei tei-q">“Double”</span>—in man it is the reverse—explains
            still better the confusion, already alluded to in this work, in
            the names and individualities, as well as in the numbers, of the
            Rishis and Prajâpatis; especially of those of the Satya Yuga and
            the Mahâbhâratan Period. It also throws additional light on what
            the Secret Doctrine teaches with regard to the Root- and the
            Seed-Manus. Not only these Progenitors of our mankind, but every
            human being, we are taught, has his prototype in the Spiritual
            Spheres, which prototype is the highest essence of his Seventh
            Principle. Thus the seven Manus become fourteen, the Root-Manu
            being the Prime Cause, and the Seed-Manu its Effect; and from the
            Satya Yuga (the first stage) to the Heroic Period, these Manus or
            Rishis become twenty-one in number.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
            The concluding sentence of this shloka shows how archaic is the
            belief and the doctrine that man is seven-fold in his
            constitution. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Thread”</span> of
            Being, which animates man, and passes through all his
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg 257]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg257"></a> Personalities, or
            Rebirths on this Earth—an allusion to Sûtrâtmâ—the Thread on
            which moreover all his <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirits”</span>
            are strung, is spun from the essence of the Three-fold, the
            Four-fold and the Five-fold which contain all the preceding.
            Panchâshikha, agreeably to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Padma Purâna</span></span>,<a href="#note_372" id="noteref_372" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> is
            one of the seven <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kumâras</span></span> who go to Shveta Dvîpa
            to worship Vishnu. We shall see, further on, what connection
            there is between the <span class="tei tei-q">“celibate”</span>
            and chaste Sons of Brahmâ, who refuse <span class="tei tei-q">“to
            multiply,”</span> and terrestrial mortals. Meanwhile, it is
            evident that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Man-Plant,
            Saptaparna,”</span> thus refers to the seven principles, and that
            man is compared to this seven-leaved plant, which is so sacred
            among Buddhists. The Egyptian allegory, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the
            Dead</span></span>, that relates to the <span class="tei tei-q">“reward of the Soul,”</span> is as suggestive of our
            septenary doctrine as it is poetical. The Deceased is allotted a
            piece of land in the field of Aanroo, wherein the Manes, the
            deified shades of the dead, glean, as the harvest they have sown
            by their actions in life, the corn seven cubits high, which grows
            in a territory divided into seven and fourteen portions. This
            corn is the food on which they will live and prosper, or that
            will kill them, in Amenti, the realm of which the Aanroo-field is
            a domain. For, as said in the hymn,<a href="#note_373" id="noteref_373" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">373</span></span></a> the
            Deceased is either destroyed therein, or becomes pure spirit for
            the Eternity, in consequence of the <span class="tei tei-q">“seven times seventy-seven lives”</span> passed, or
            to be passed, on Earth. The idea of the corn reaped as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“fruit of our actions”</span> is very
            graphic.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is that
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spark”</span> which <span class="tei tei-q">“hangs from the Flame”</span>? It is Jîva, the Monad
            in conjunction with Manas, or rather its aroma—that which remains
            from each Personality, when worthy, and hangs from Âtmâ-Buddhi,
            the Flame, by the Thread of Life. In whatever way it is
            interpreted, and into whatever number of principles the human
            being is divided, it may be easily shown that this doctrine is
            supported by all the ancient religions, from the Vedic to the
            Egyptian, from the Zoroastrian to the Jewish. In the case of the
            last-mentioned, the Kabalistic works offer abundant proof of this
            statement. The entire system of the Kabalistic numerals is based
            on the divine Septenary hanging from the Triad, thus forming the
            Decad, and its permutations 7, 5, 4, and 3, which, finally, all

            Mystics—is very small indeed, being confined to unimportant
            divergences of form and expression. Thus Eastern Occultism refers
            to our Earth as the Fourth World, the lowest of the Chain, above
            which run upward on both curves the six Globes, three on each
            side. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, on the other hand,
            calls the Earth the lower, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em>, adding that upon the
            six depend all things which are in it (Microprosopus). The

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
            shown in Volume II, that the number seven, as well as the
            doctrine of the septenary constitution of man, was preëminent in
            all the secret systems. It plays as important a part in Western
            Kabalah as in Eastern Occultism. Éliphas Lévi calls the number
            seven <span class="tei tei-q">“the key to the Mosaic creation and
            the symbols of every religion.”</span> He shows the Kabalah
            faithfully following even the septenary division of man, for the
            diagram he gives in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Clef des Grands Mystères</span></span><a href="#note_389" id="noteref_389" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> is
            septenary. This may be seen at a glance, however cleverly the
            correct thought is veiled. One needs also only to look at the
            diagram, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Formation of the
            Soul,”</span> in Mathers' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabbalah Unveiled</span></span>,<a href="#note_390" id="noteref_390" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a>
            from the above mentioned, work of Lévi, to find the same, though
            with a different interpretation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it stands
            with both the Kabalistic and Occult names attached:</p>

            Manas is the Third Soul—the human in its light side, and animal,
            in its connection with Samaël or Kâma. Nephesh is really the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath of (animal) Life”</span> breathed
            into Adam, the Man of Dust; it is consequently the Vital Spark,
            the informing Element. Without Manas, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Reasoning Soul,”</span> or Mind, which in Lévi's
            diagram is miscalled Nephesh, Âtmâ-Buddhi is irrational on this
            plane and cannot act. It is Buddhi which is the Plastic Mediator;
            not Manas, the intelligent medium between the upper Triad and the
            lower Quaternary. But there are many such strange and curious
            transformations to be found in the Kabalistic works—a convincing
            proof that this literature has become a sad jumble. We do not
            accept the classification, except in this one particular, in
            order to show the points of agreement.</p>

            explanation of his diagram, and what the Esoteric Doctrine
            teaches—and compare the two. Lévi, too, makes a distinction
            between Kabalistic and Occult Pneumatics.</p>

            nor on any material plane, but in the Spacial Depths of the first
            differentiation of the eternal Root-Matter. On our nascent Globe,
            things proceed differently. The Monad or Jîva, as said in
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
            Unveiled</span></span>,<a href="#note_394" id="noteref_394" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> is,
            first of all, shot down by the Law of Evolution into the lowest
            form of matter—the mineral. After a sevenfold gyration encased in
            the stone, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg
            267]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg267"></a>
            or that which will become mineral and stone in the Fourth Round,
            it creeps out of it, say, as a lichen. Passing thence, through
            all the forms of vegetable matter, into what is termed animal
            matter, it has now reached the point at which it has become the
            germ, so to speak, of the animal, that will become the physical
            man. All this, up to the Third Round, is formless, as matter, and
            senseless, as consciousness. For the Monad, or Jîva, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
            se</span></span>, cannot be called even Spirit: it is a Ray, a
            Breath of the Absolute, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Absoluteness</span></span> rather; and
            the Absolute Homogeneity, having no relations with the
            conditioned and relative finiteness, is unconscious on our plane.
            Therefore, besides the material which will be needed for its
            future human form, the Monad requires (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) a
            spiritual model, or prototype, for that material to shape itself
            into; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) an intelligent
            consciousness, to guide its evolution and progress, neither of
            which is possessed by the homogeneous Monad, or by senseless
            though living matter. The Adam of dust requires the Soul of Life
            to be breathed into him: the two middle Principles, which are the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sentient</span></em> Life of the irrational
            animal and the Human Soul, for the former is irrational without
            the latter. It is only when, from a potential androgyne, man has
            become separated into male and female, that he will be endowed
            with this conscious, rational, individual Soul (Manas),
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the principle, or the intelligence, of
            the Elohim,”</span> to receive which, he has to eat of the fruit
            of Knowledge from the Tree of Good and Evil. How is he to obtain
            all this? The Occult Doctrine teaches that while the Monad is
            cycling on downward into matter, these very Elohim, or Pitris—the
            lower Dhyân Chohans—are evolving, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pari
            passu</span></span> with it, on a higher and more spiritual
            plane, descending also relatively into matter, on their own plane
            of consciousness, when, after having reached a certain point,
            they will meet the incarnating senseless Monad, encased in the
            lowest matter, and blending the two potencies, Spirit and Matter,
            the union will produce that terrestrial symbol of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Man”</span> in
            space—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Perfect Man</span></span>. In the
            Sânkhya Philosophy, Purusha (Spirit) is spoken of as something
            impotent unless it mounts on the shoulders of Prakriti (Matter),
            which, left alone, is—senseless. But in the Secret Philosophy
            they are viewed as graduated. Spirit and Matter, though one and
            the same thing in their origin, when once they are on the plane
            of differentiation, begin each of them their evolutionary
            progress in contrary directions—Spirit falling gradually into
            Matter, and the latter ascending to its original condition, that
            of a pure spiritual Substance. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg268"></a> Both are inseparable, yet ever separated.
            On the physical plane, two like poles will always repel each
            other, while the negative and the positive are mutually
            attracted; so do Spirit and Matter stand to each other—the two
            poles of the same homogeneous Substance, the Root-Principle of
            the Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore,
            when the hour strikes for Purusha to mount on Prakriti's
            shoulders for the formation of the Perfect Man—rudimentary man of
            the first Two and a Half Races being only the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em>, gradually evolving into
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most perfect, of mammals</span></em>—the
            Celestial Ancestors (Entities from preceding Worlds, called in
            India the Shishta) step in on this our plane, and incarnate in
            the physical or animal man, as the Pitris had stepped in before
            them for the formation of the latter. Thus the two processes for
            the two <span class="tei tei-q">“creations”</span>—the animal and
            the divine man—differ greatly. The Pitris shoot out from their
            ethereal bodies still more ethereal and shadowy similitudes of
            themselves, or what we should now call <span class="tei tei-q">“doubles,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“astral

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Commentary
            first speaks of the <span class="tei tei-q">“numberless and
            countless crores of Lives.”</span> Is Pasteur, then,
            unconsciously taking the first step toward Occult Science, in
            declaring that, if he dared express his ideas fully upon this
            subject, he would say, that the organic cells are endowed with a
            vital potency that does not cease its activity with the cessation
            of a current of oxygen towards them, and does not, on that
            account, break off its relations with life itself, which is
            supported by the influence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg270"></a> of that gas? <span class="tei tei-q">“I
            would add,”</span> continues Pasteur, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the evolution of the germ is accomplished by
            means of complicated phenomena, among which we must class
            processes of fermentation”</span>; and life, according to Claude
            Bernard and Pasteur, is nothing else than a process of
            fermentation. That there exist in Nature Beings, or Lives, that
            can live and thrive without air, even on our Globe, has been
            demonstrated by the same Scientists. Pasteur found that many of
            the lower lives, such as vibriones, and other microbes and
            bacteria, could exist without air, which, on the contrary, killed
            them. They derived the oxygen necessary for their multiplication
            from the various substances that surrounded them. He calls them
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ærobes</span></span>, living on the tissues
            of our matter, when the latter has ceased to form a part of an
            integral and living whole (then called very unscientifically by
            Science <span class="tei tei-q">“dead matter”</span>), and
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">anærobes</span></span>. The one kind binds
            oxygen, and contributes greatly to the destruction of animal life
            and vegetable tissues, furnishing to the atmosphere materials
            which enter, later on, into the constitution of other organisms;
            the other finally destroys, or rather annihilates, the so-called
            organic substance; ultimate decay being impossible without their
            participation. Certain germ-cells, such as those of yeast,
            develop and multiply in air, but when deprived of it, they will
            adapt themselves to life without air and become ferments,
            absorbing oxygen from substances coming in contact with them, and
            thereby ruining the latter. The cells in fruit, when lacking free
            oxygen, act as ferments and stimulate fermentation. <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore the vegetable cell, in this case,
            manifests its life as an anærobic being. Why, then, should an
            organic cell form, in this case, an exception?”</span> asks
            Professor Bogolubof. Pasteur shows that in the substance of our
            tissues and organs, the cell, not finding sufficient oxygen for
            itself, stimulates fermentation in the same way as the
            fruit-cell, and Claude Bernard thought that Pasteur's idea of the
            formation of ferments found its application and corroboration in
            the fact that urea increases in the blood during strangulation.
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Life</span></span> therefore is
            everywhere in the Universe, and, Occultism teaches us, it is also
            in the atom.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Bhûmi appears with six sisters,”</span> says the
            Commentary. It is a Vedic teaching that <span class="tei tei-q">“there are three Earths, corresponding to three
            Heavens, and our Earth [the fourth] is called Bhûmi.”</span> This
            is the explanation given by our exoteric Western Orientalists.
            But the esoteric meaning, and allusion to it in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, is that it refers to
            our Planetary Chain; <span class="tei tei-q">“three
            Earths”</span> on the descending arc, and <span class="tei tei-q">“three <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg
            271]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg271"></a>
            Heavens,”</span> which are three Earths or Globes also, only far
            more ethereal, on the ascending or spiritual arc. By the first
            three we descend into Matter, by the other three we ascend into
            Spirit; the lowest one, Bhûmi, our Earth, forming the turning
            point, so to say, and containing, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">potentially</span></em>, as much of Spirit
            as it does of Matter. But we shall treat of this hereafter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
            teaching of the Commentary, then, is that every new Round
            develops one of the Compound Elements, as now known to Science,
            which rejects the primitive nomenclature, preferring to subdivide
            them into constituents. If Nature is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ever-Becoming”</span> on the manifested plane, then
            these Elements are to be regarded in the same light: they have to
            evolve, progress, and increase to the manvantaric end.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the First
            Round, we are taught, developed but one Element, and a nature and
            humanity in what may be spoken of as one aspect of Nature—called
            by some, very unscientifically, though it may be so <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">de
            facto</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“one-dimensional
            space.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Second
            Round brought forth and developed two Elements, Fire and Earth;
            and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em> humanity, adapted to this
            condition of Nature, if we can give the name humanity to beings
            living under conditions now unknown to men, was—to use again a
            familiar phrase in a strictly figurative sense, the only way in
            which it can be used correctly—a <span class="tei tei-q">“two-dimensional”</span> species.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The processes
            of natural development which we are now considering will at once
            elucidate and discredit the fashion of speculating on the
            attributes of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em>
            or more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dimensional</span></em> space; but, in
            passing, it is worth while to point out the real significance of
            the sound, but incomplete, intuition that has prompted—among
            Spiritualists and Theosophists, and several great men of Science,
            for the matter of that<a href="#note_398" id="noteref_398" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a>—the
            use of the modern expression, the <span class="tei tei-q">“fourth
            dimension of space.”</span> To begin with, the superficial
            absurdity of assuming that Space itself is measurable in any
            direction is of little consequence. The familiar phrase can only
            be an abbreviation of the fuller form—the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth dimension of matter, in
            Space</span></span>.”</span><a href="#note_399" id="noteref_399" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a> But
            even thus expanded, it is an unhappy phrase, because while it is
            perfectly true that the progress of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg272"></a> evolution may be destined to introduce us
            to new characteristics of matter, those with which we are already
            familiar are really more numerous than the three dimensions. The
            qualities, or what is perhaps the best available term, the
            characteristics of matter, must clearly bear a direct relation
            always to the senses of man. Matter has extension, colour, motion
            (molecular motion), taste and smell, corresponding to the
            existing senses of man, and the next characteristic it
            develops—let us call it for the moment <span class="tei tei-q">“Permeability”</span>—will correspond to the next
            sense of man, which we may call <span class="tei tei-q">“Normal
            Clairvoyance.”</span> Thus, when some bold thinkers have been
            thirsting for a fourth dimension, to explain the passage of
            matter through matter, and the production of knots upon an
            endless cord, they have been in want of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sixth
            characteristic</span></em> of matter. The three dimensions belong
            really to only one attribute, or characteristic, of
            matter—extension; and popular common sense justly rebels against
            the idea that, under any condition of things, there can be more
            than three of such dimensions as length, breadth and thickness.
            These terms, and the term <span class="tei tei-q">“dimension”</span> itself, all belong to one plane of
            thought, to one stage of evolution, to one characteristic of
            matter. So long as there are foot-rules within the resources of
            cosmos, to apply to matter, so long will they be able to measure
            it three ways and no more; just as, from the time the idea of
            measurement first occupied a place in the human understanding, it
            has been possible to apply measurement in three directions and no
            more. But these considerations do not in any way militate against
            the certainty that, in the progress of time, as the faculties of
            humanity are multiplied, so will the characteristics of matter be
            multiplied also. Meanwhile, the expression is far more incorrect
            than even the familiar phrase of the sun's <span class="tei tei-q">“rising”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“setting.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now return
            to the consideration of material evolution through the Rounds.
            Matter in the Second Round, it has been stated, may be
            figuratively referred to as two-dimensional. But here another
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">caveat</span></span> must be entered. This
            loose and figurative expression may be regarded—on one plane of
            thought, as we have just seen—as equivalent to the second
            characteristic of matter, corresponding to the second perceptive
            faculty or sense of man. But these two linked scales of evolution
            are concerned with the processes going on within the limits of a
            single Round. The succession of primary aspects of Nature, with
            which the succession of Rounds is concerned, has to do, as
            already indicated, with the development of the Elements—in the
            Occult sense—Fire, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg
            273]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg273"></a>
            Air, Water, Earth. We are only in the Fourth Round, and our
            catalogue so far stops short. The order in which these Elements
            are mentioned, in the last sentence but one, is the correct one
            for Esoteric purposes and in the Secret Teachings. Milton was
            right when he spoke of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Powers of
            Fire, Air, Water, Earth”</span>; the Earth, such as we know it
            now, had no existence before the Fourth Round, hundreds of
            millions of years ago, the commencement of our geological Earth.
            The Globe, says the Commentary, was <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fiery, cool and radiant, as its ethereal men
            and animals, during the First Round</span></span>”</span>—a
            contradiction or paradox in the opinion of our present
            Science—<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">luminous and more
            dense and heavy, during the Second Round; watery during the
            Third</span></span>.”</span> Thus are the Elements reversed.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The centres of
            consciousness of the Third Round, destined to develop into
            humanity as we know it, arrived at a perception of the third
            Element, Water. If we had to frame our conclusions according to
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">data</span></em> furnished us by Geologists,
            then we would say that there was no real water, even during the
            Carboniferous Period. We are told that gigantic masses of carbon,
            which existed formerly spread in the atmosphere, as carbonic
            acid, were absorbed by plants, while a large proportion of that
            gas was mixed in the water. Now, if this be so, and we have to
            believe that all the carbonic acid which went to compose those
            plants that formed bituminous coal, lignite, etc., and went
            towards the formation of lime-stone, and so on, that all this was
            at that period in the atmosphere in gaseous form, then, there
            must have been seas and oceans of liquid carbonic acid! But how
            then could the Carboniferous Period be preceded by the Devonian
            and Silurian Ages—those of fishes and molluscs—on that
            assumption? Barometric pressure, moreover, must have exceeded
            several hundred times the pressure of our present atmosphere. How
            could organisms, even so simple as those of certain fishes and
            molluscs, stand that? There is a curious work by Blanchard, on
            the Origin of Life, wherein he shows some strange contradictions
            and confusions in the theories of his colleagues, and which we
            recommend to the reader's attention.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those of the
            Fourth Round have added Earth as a state of matter to their
            stock, as well as the three other Elements in their present
            transformation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short, none
            of the so-called Elements were, in the three preceding Rounds, as

            Ghost,”</span> and in the next <span class="tei tei-q">“Baphomet,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Androgyne Goat of Mendes”</span>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Air</span></span>, simply Nitrogen,
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath of the Supporters of the
            Heavenly Dome,”</span> as the Mahometan Mystics call it;
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Water</span></span>, that primordial
            fluid which was required, according to Moses, to make a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Living Soul.”</span> And this may
            account for the flagrant discrepancies and unscientific
            statements found in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>. Separate the first
            from the second chapter; read the former as a scripture of the
            Elohists, and the latter as that of the far later Jehovists;
            still one finds, if one reads between the lines, the same order
            in which created things appear; namely, Fire (Light), Air, Water,
            and Man (or Earth). For the sentence of the first chapter (the
            Elohistic), <span class="tei tei-q">“In the beginning God created
            the heaven and the earth,”</span> is a mistranslation; it is not
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the heaven and the earth,”</span> but
            the duplex, or dual, Heaven, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">upper</span></em>
            and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower</span></em> Heavens, or the separation
            of Primordial Substance that was light in its upper, and dark in
            its lower portions (the manifested Universe), in its duality of
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invisible</span></em> (to the senses), and
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">visible</span></em> to our perceptions.
            <span class="tei tei-q">“God divided the light from the
            darkness”</span>; and then made the firmament (Air). <span class="tei tei-q">“Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
            and let it divide the waters from the waters,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the waters which were under the firmament [our
            manifested visible Universe] from the waters which were
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">above</span></em> the firmament [the (to us)
            invisible planes of being].”</span> In the second chapter (the
            Jehovistic), plants and herbs are created before water, just as
            in the first, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">light</span></em> is produced before the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sun</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">“God made the earth and the heavens, and every plant
            of the field <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before it was in the earth</span></em>, and
            every herb of the field <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before it grew</span></em>; for the Lord God
            [Elohim] had not caused it to rain upon the earth,
            etc.”</span>—an absurdity unless the esoteric explanation is
            accepted. The plants <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were</span></em> created before they were in
            the earth—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for there was no earth then such as it is
            now</span></span>; and the herb of the field was in existence
            before it grew as it does now, in the Fourth Round.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Discussing and
            explaining the nature of the invisible Elements and the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Primordial Fire”</span> mentioned above,
            Éliphas Lévi invariably calls it the <span class="tei tei-q">“Astral Light”</span>: with him it is the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Grand Agent Magique.”</span> Undeniably
            it is so, but—only so far as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Black</span></em>
            Magic is concerned, and on the lowest planes of what we call
            Ether, the noumenon of which is Âkâsha; and even this would be
            held incorrect by orthodox Occultists. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Astral Light”</span> is simply the older
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Sidereal Light”</span> of Paracelsus;
            and to say that <span class="tei tei-q">“everything which exists
            has been evolved from it, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg275"></a> it preserves and reproduces all
            forms,”</span> as he does, is to enunciate truth only in the
            second proposition. The first is erroneous; for if all that
            exists was evolved <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em> (or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">viâ</span></span>) it, this is not the
            Astral Light, since the latter is not the container of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
            things but, at best, only the reflector of this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>.
            Éliphas Lévi very truly shows it <span class="tei tei-q">“a force
            in Nature,”</span> by means of which <span class="tei tei-q">“a
            single man who can master it ... might throw the world into
            confusion and transform its face”</span>; for it is the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Arcanum of transcendent
            Magic.”</span> Quoting the words of the great Western Kabalist in
            their translated form,<a href="#note_400" id="noteref_400" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a> we
            may, perhaps, the better explain them by the occasional addition
            of a word or two, to show the difference between Western and
            Eastern explanations of the same subject. The author says of the
            great Magic Agent:</p>

            central attraction ... the Astral Light, this electro-magnetic

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far he is
            right enough. But when the great authority of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg276"></a> Western Kabalists adds that,
            nevertheless, <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not the immortal
            Spirit, as the Indian Hierophants have imagined”</span>—we
            answer, that he slanders the said Hierophants, as they have said
            nothing of the kind; for even the Purânic exoteric writings
            flatly contradict the assertion. No Hindû has ever mistaken
            Prakriti—the Astral Light being only above the lowest plane of
            Prakriti, the Material Kosmos—for the <span class="tei tei-q">“immortal Spirit.”</span> Prakriti is ever called
            Mâyâ, Illusion, and is doomed to disappear with the rest, the
            Gods included, at the hour of the Pralaya. As it is shown that
            Âkâsha is not even the Ether, least of all then, we imagine, can
            it be the Astral Light. Those unable to penetrate beyond the dead
            letter of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, have occasionally
            confused Âkâsha with Prakriti, with Ether, and even with the
            visible Sky! It is true also that those who have invariably
            translated the term Âkâsha by <span class="tei tei-q">“Ether”</span>—Wilson, for instance—finding it called
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the material cause of sound”</span>
            possessing, moreover, this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one single property</span></em>, have
            ignorantly imagined it to be <span class="tei tei-q">“material,”</span> in the physical sense. True,
            again, that if the characteristics are accepted literally, then,
            since nothing material or physical, and therefore conditioned and
            temporary, can be immortal—according to metaphysics and
            philosophy—it would follow that Âkâsha is neither infinite nor
            immortal. But all this is erroneous, since both the words
            Pradhâna, Primeval Matter, and Sound, as a property, have been
            misunderstood; the former term (Pradhâna) being certainly
            synonymous with Mûlaprakriti and Âkâsha, and the latter (Sound)
            with the Verbum, the Word or the Logos. This is easy to
            demonstrate; for it is shown in the following sentence from
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu
            Purâna</span></span>.<a href="#note_401" id="noteref_401" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“There was neither day nor night, nor
            sky, nor earth, nor darkness, nor light, nor any other thing,
            save only One, unapprehensible by intellect, or that which is
            Brahman, and Pums, [Spirit] and Pradhâna [Primordial
            Matter].”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, what is
            Pradhâna, if it is not Mûlaprakriti, the Root of All, in another
            aspect? For though Pradhâna is said, further on, to merge into
            the Deity, as everything else does, in order to leave the One
            absolute during the Pralaya, yet is it held as infinite and
            immortal. The literal translation is given as: <span class="tei tei-q">“One Prâdhânika Brahma Spirit: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span> was”</span>; and
            the Commentator interprets the compound term as a substantive,
            not as a derivative word used attributively, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            like something <span class="tei tei-q">“conjoined with
            Pradhâna.”</span> The student has to note, moreover, that the
            Purânic is a dualistic system, not evolutionary, and that, in
            this <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg
            277]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg277"></a>
            respect, far more will be found, from an Esoteric standpoint, in
            the Sânkhya, and even in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mânava-Dharma-Shâstra</span></span>,
            however much the latter differs from the former. Hence Pradhâna,
            even in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, is an aspect of
            Parabrahman, not an evolution, and must be the same as the
            Vedântic Mûlaprakriti. <span class="tei tei-q">“Prakriti, in its
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primary</span></em> state, is
            Âkâsha,”</span> says a Vedântin scholar.<a href="#note_402" id="noteref_402" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> It
            is almost abstract Nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Âkâsha, then,
            is Pradhâna in another form, and as such cannot be Ether, the
            ever-invisible agent, courted even by Physical Science. Nor is it
            Astral Light. It is, as said, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">noumenon</span></span> of the seven-fold
            differentiated Prakriti<a href="#note_403" id="noteref_403" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a>—the

            characteristic of matter—Permeability—which should be developed
            concurrently with the sixth sense, may be expected to develop at
            the proper period in this Round. But with the next Element added
            to our resources, in the next Round, Permeability will become so
            manifest a characteristic of matter, that the densest forms of
            this Round will seem to man's perceptions as obstructive to him
            as a thick fog, and no more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now
            return to the Life-Cycle. Without entering at length upon the
            description given of the Higher <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lives</span></span>, we must direct
            our attention, at present, simply to the earthly Beings and the
            Earth itself. The latter, we are told, is built up for the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></em> Round by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Devourers,”</span> which disintegrate and
            differentiate the germs of other Lives in the Elements; pretty
            much, it must be supposed, as in the present stage of the world,
            the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ærobes</span></span> do, when, undermining
            and loosening the chemical structure in an organism, they
            transform animal matter, and generate substances that vary in
            their constitutions. Thus Occultism disposes of the so-called
            Azoic Age of Science, for it shows that there never was a time
            when the Earth was without life upon it. Wherever there is an
            atom of matter, a particle, or a molecule, even in its most
            gaseous condition, there is life in it, however latent and
            unconscious.</p>

            Life cannot produce an inorganic atom, whether single or complex,
            and there is life even in Laya, just as a man in a profound
            cataleptic state—to all appearance a corpse—is still a living
            being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Devourers”</span>—in whom the men of

            the Fire-Mist, if they will, as the Occultist will offer no
            objection to this—when the <span class="tei tei-q">“Devourers,”</span> we say, have differentiated the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire Atoms,”</span> by a peculiar
            process of segmentation, the latter become Life-Germs, which
            aggregate according to the laws of cohesion and affinity. Then
            the Life-Germs produce Lives of another kind, which work on the
            structure of our Globes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, in the
            First Round, the Globe, having been built by the primitive
            Fire-Lives—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, formed into a sphere—had
            no solidity, no qualifications, save a cold brightness, no form,
            no colour; it is only towards the end of the First Round that it
            developed one Element, which, from its inorganic, so to say, or
            simple Essence, has become now, in our Round, the fire we know
            throughout the System. The Earth was in her first Rûpa, the
            essence of which is the Âkâshic Principle named ——, that which is
            now known as, and very erroneously termed, Astral Light, which
            Éliphas Lévi calls the <span class="tei tei-q">“Imagination of

            others do.</p>

            the talent of heaping up one contradiction on the other, of
            making one paradox chase another in the same sentence, and in
            such flowing language, as Éliphas Lévi. He leads his reader

            it. In Europe there have been two Occultists only who have
            discovered and even partially applied it in practice, though its
            composition has always been known among the highest Eastern
            Initiates. The ozone of the modern Chemists is poison compared

            fluids and plastic form of our Globe into the hard, crusted,
            grossly material sphere we are living on. Bhûmi has reached her
            fourth Principle. To this it may be objected that the law of
            analogy, so much insisted upon, is broken. Not at all. Earth will
            reach her true ultimate form—her body shell—inversely in this to
            man, only toward the end of the Manvantara, after the Seventh
            Round. Eugenius Philalethes was right when he assured his
            readers, <span class="tei tei-q">“on his word of honour,”</span>
            that no one had yet seen the <span class="tei tei-q">“Earth,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Matter in its essential
            form. Our Globe is, so far, in its Kâmarûpic state—the Astral
            Body of Desires of Ahamkâra, dark Egotism, the progeny of Mahat,
            on the lower plane.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
            molecularly constituted matter, least of all the human Body,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg281"></a> Sthûla Sharîra,
            that is the grossest of all our <span class="tei tei-q">“Principles,”</span> but verily the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">middle</span></em> Principle, the real
            Animal Centre, whereas our Body is but its shell, the
            irresponsible factor and medium through which the beast in us
            acts all its life. Every intellectual Theosophist will understand
            my real meaning. Thus the idea that the human tabernacle is built
            by countless Lives, just in the same way as was the rocky crust
            of our Earth, has nothing repulsive in it for the true Mystic.
            Nor can Science oppose the Occult teaching, for it is not because
            the microscope will ever fail to detect the ultimate living atom
            or life, that it can reject the doctrine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>)
            Science teaches us that the living as well as the dead organisms
            of both man and animal are swarming with bacteria of a hundred
            various kinds; that from without we are threatened with the
            invasion of microbes with every breath we draw, and from within
            by leucomaines, ærobes, anærobes, and what not. But Science has
            never yet gone so far as to assert with the Occult doctrine, that
            our bodies, as well as those of animals, plants, and stones, are
            themselves altogether built up of such beings; which, with the
            exception of the larger species, no microscope can detect. So far
            as regards the purely animal and material portion of man, Science
            is on its way to discoveries that will go far towards
            corroborating this theory. Chemistry and Physiology are the two
            great magicians of the future, which are destined to open the
            eyes of mankind to great physical truths. With every day, the
            identity between the animal and physical man, between the plant
            and man, and even between the reptile and its nest, the rock, and
            man—is more and more clearly shown. The physical and chemical
            constituents of all being found to be identical, Chemical Science
            may well say that there is no difference between the matter which
            composes the ox, and that which forms man. But the Occult
            doctrine is far more explicit. It says: Not only the chemical
            compounds are the same, but the same infinitesimal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invisible</span></em> Lives compose the
            atoms of the bodies of the mountain and the daisy, of man and the
            ant, of the elephant and of the tree which shelters it from the
            sun. Each particle—whether you call it organic or
            inorganic—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is a</span></em> Life. Every atom and
            molecule in the Universe is both <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life-giving</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">death-giving</span></em> to such forms,
            inasmuch as it builds by aggregation universes, and the ephemeral
            vehicles ready to receive the transmigrating soul, and as
            eternally destroys and changes the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forms</span></em>, and expels the souls from
            their temporary abodes. It creates and kills; it is
            self-generating and self-destroying; it brings <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg282"></a> into being, and annihilates,
            that mystery of mysteries, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living
            body</span></em> of man, animal, or plant, every second in time
            and space; and it generates equally life and death, beauty and
            ugliness, good and bad, and even the agreeable and disagreeable,
            the beneficent and maleficent sensations. It is that mysterious
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Life</span></span>, represented
            collectively by countless myriads of Lives, that follows in its
            own sporadic way the hitherto incomprehensible law of Atavism;
            that copies family resemblances, as well as those it finds
            impressed in the Aura of the generators of every future human
            being; a mystery, in short, that will receive fuller attention
            elsewhere. For the present, one instance may be cited in
            illustration. Modern Science is beginning to find out that
            ptomaine, the alkaloid poison generated by decaying corpses and
            matter—a Life also, extracted with the help of volatile ether,
            yields a smell as strong as that of the freshest orange-blossoms;
            but that free from oxygen, such alkaloids yield either a most
            sickening, disgusting smell, or a most agreeable aroma, which
            recalls that of the most delicately scented flowers; and it is
            suspected that such blossoms owe their agreeable smell to the
            poisonous ptomaine. The venomous essence of certain fungi, also,
            is nearly identical with the venom of the cobra of India, the
            most deadly of serpents. The French savants Arnaud, Gautier, and
            Villiers, have found in the saliva of living men the same
            venomous alkaloid as in that of the toad, the salamander, the
            cobra, and the trigonocephalus of Portugal. It is proven that
            venom of the deadliest kind, whether called ptomaine, or
            leucomaine, or alkaloid, is generated by living men, animals and
            plants. Gautier also discovered an alkaloid in the fresh carcase
            and brains of an ox, and a venom which he calls xanthocreatinine,
            similar to the substance extracted from the poisonous saliva of
            reptiles. It is the muscular tissues, the most active organs in
            the animal economy, that are suspected of being the generators or
            factors of venoms, which have the same importance as carbonic
            acid and urea in the functions of life, and are the ultimate
            products of inner combustion. And though it is not yet fully
            determined whether poisons can be generated by the animal systems
            of living beings, without the participation and interference of
            microbes, it is ascertained that the animal does produce venomous
            substances in its physiological or living state.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, having
            discovered the effects, Science has to find their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primary</span></em> causes; and this it can
            never do without the help of the old sciences, of Alchemy, Occult
            Botany and Physics. We are taught that every physiological
            change, in addition to pathological phenomena, diseases—nay,
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg283"></a> life itself, or
            rather the objective phenomena of life, produced by certain
            conditions and changes in the tissues of the body, which allow
            and force life to act in that body—that all this is due to those
            unseen <span class="tei tei-q">“Creators”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Destroyers,”</span> which are called, in such a
            loose and general way, microbes. It might be supposed that these
            Fiery Lives and the microbes of Science are identical. This is
            not true. The Fiery Lives are the seventh and highest
            sub-division of the plane of matter, and correspond in the
            individual with the One Life of the Universe, though only on that
            plane of matter. The microbes of Science are the first and lowest
            sub-division on the second plane—that of material Prâna, or Life.
            The physical body of man undergoes a complete change of structure
            every seven years, and its destruction and preservation are due
            to the alternate functions of the Fiery Lives, as Destroyers and
            Builders. They are Builders by sacrificing themselves, in the
            form of vitality, to restrain the destructive influence of the
            microbes, and, by supplying the microbes with what is necessary,
            they compel them under that restraint to build up the material
            body and its cells. They are Destroyers also, when that restraint
            is removed, and the microbes, unsupplied with vital constructive
            energy, are left to run riot as destructive agents. Thus, during
            the first half of a man's life, the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five</span></em>
            periods of seven years each, the Fiery Lives are indirectly
            engaged in the process of building up man's material body; Life
            is on the ascending scale, and the force is used in construction
            and increase. After this period is passed, the age of
            retrogression commences, and, the work of the Fiery Lives
            exhausting their strength, the work of destruction and decrease
            also commences.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An analogy
            between cosmic events in the descent of Spirit into Matter, for
            the first half of a Manvantara (planetary as well as human), and
            its ascent, at the expense of Matter, in the second half, may
            here be traced. These considerations have to do solely with the
            plane of matter, but the restraining influence of the Fiery Lives
            on the lowest sub-division of the second plane, the microbes, is
            confirmed by the fact mentioned in the theory of Pasteur above
            referred to, that the cells of the organs, when they do not find
            sufficient oxygen for themselves, adapt themselves to that
            condition and form <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ferments</span></em>, which, by absorbing
            oxygen from substances which come in contact with them, produce
            their destruction. Thus the process is commenced by one cell
            robbing its neighbour of the source of its vitality, when the
            supply is insufficient; and the destruction so commenced steadily
            progresses.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such
            experimenters as Pasteur are the best friends and helpers of the
            Destroyers, and the worst enemies of the Creators—if the latter
            were not at the same time Destroyers also. However it may be, one
            thing is certain in this: the knowledge of these primary causes,
            and of the ultimate essence of every Element, of its Lives, their
            functions, properties, and conditions of change—constitutes the
            basis of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Magic</span></span>. Paracelsus was,
            perhaps, the only Occultist in Europe, during the latter
            centuries of the Christian era, who was versed in this mystery.
            Had not a criminal hand put an end to his life years before the
            time allotted him by Nature, physiological Magic would have fewer
            secrets for the civilized world than it now has.</p>

            But what has the Moon to do in all this, we may be asked. What
            have <span class="tei tei-q">“Fish, Sin and Soma [Moon],”</span>
            in the apocalyptic sentence of the Stanza, to do in company with
            the Life-microbes? With the latter nothing, except that they
            avail themselves of the tabernacle of clay prepared by them; with
            divine perfect Man everything, since <span class="tei tei-q">“Fish, Sin and Moon”</span> conjointly compose the
            three symbols of the immortal Being.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is all
            that can be given. Nor does the writer pretend to know more of
            these strange symbols than may be inferred about them from
            exoteric religions—from the mystery, perhaps, which underlies the
            Matsya (Fish) Avatâra of Vishnu, the. Chaldean Oannes, the
            Man-Fish, recorded in the imperishable sign of the Zodiac,
            Pisces, and running throughout the two <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testaments</span></span> in the personages
            of Joshua <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of Nun (the Fish)”</span>
            and Jesus; from the allegorical <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin,”</span> or Fall of Spirit into Matter; and from
            the Moon—in so far as it relates to the Lunar Ancestors, the
            Pitris.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the
            present, it may be as well to remind the reader, that while the
            Moon-Goddesses were connected in every mythology, especially the
            Grecian, with child-birth, because of the influence of the Moon
            on women and conception, the Occult and actual connection of our
            satellite with fecundation is to this day unknown to Physiology,
            which regards every popular practice in this connection as gross
            superstition. As it is useless to discuss these in detail, we can
            only stop for the present to notice the lunar symbology casually,
            to show that the said superstition belongs to the most ancient
            beliefs, and even to Judaism—the basis of Christianity. With the
            Israelites, the chief function of Jehovah was child-giving, and
            the Esotericism of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, interpreted
            kabalistically, shows undeniably that the Holy of Holies in the
            Temple was simply <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg
            285]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg285"></a>
            the symbol of the womb. This is now proven beyond doubt and
            cavil, by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">numerical</span></em> reading of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> in general, and of
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span> especially. This idea
            must certainly have been borrowed by the Jews from the Egyptians
            and Indians, whose Holy of Holies is symbolized by the King's
            Chamber in the Great Pyramid and the Yoni symbols of exoteric
            Hindûism. To make the matter clearer, and to show at the same
            time the enormous difference in the spirit of interpretation and
            the original meaning of the same symbols between the ancient
            Eastern Occultists and the Jewish Kabalists, we refer the reader
            to the Section on <span class="tei tei-q">“The Holy of
            Holies,”</span> in the second Volume.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Phallic
            worship has developed only with the loss of the keys to the true
            meaning of the symbols. It was the last and most fatal turning
            from the highway of truth and divine knowledge into the side path
            of fiction, raised into dogma through human falsification and
            hierarchic ambition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is this

            character. To see in Nirvâna annihilation, amounts to saying of a

            is absolutely and hopelessly inadequate. The only approach to
            anything like a comprehensive conception of it can be attempted
            solely in the panoramic visions of the Soul, through spiritual

            higher being, on a far higher plane, to recommence its cycle of

            Yugas, down to the beginning of the Third Root Race; after which
            it is the Patriarchs, Heroes, and the Manes, as in the Egyptian

            Dhyânis of a lower order, up to King Menes and the human Kings of

            symbologists this Mythopœic Age is of course regarded as only a

            over men, followed by Dynasties of Heroes or Giants, exist in the
            annals of every nation, it is difficult to understand how all the
            peoples under the sun, some of whom are separated by vast oceans
            and belong to different hemispheres, such as the ancient
            Peruvians and Mexicans, as well as the Chaldeans, could have
            worked out the same <span class="tei tei-q">“fairy tales”</span>

            However, as the Secret Doctrine teaches <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">history</span></em>—which, although esoteric
            and traditional, is, none the less, more reliable than profane
            history—we are entitled to our beliefs as much as anyone else,
            whether religionist or sceptic. And that Doctrine says that the
            Dhyâni-Buddhas of the two higher Groups, namely, the Watchers or
            the Architects, furnished the many and various races with divine
            kings and leaders. It is the latter who taught humanity their
            arts and sciences, and the former who revealed to the incarnated
            Monads that had just shaken off their Vehicles of the lower
            Kingdoms, and who had, therefore, lost every recollection of
            their divine origin, the great spiritual truths of the
            transcendental Worlds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, as
            expressed in the Stanza, the Watchers <span class="tei tei-q">“descend on radiant Earth and reign over men,
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who are
            themselves</span></em>.”</span> The reigning Kings had finished
            their cycle on Earth and other Worlds, in the preceding Rounds.
            In the future Manvantaras they will have risen to higher
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg288"></a> Systems than our
            planetary World; and it is the Elect of our Humanity, the
            Pioneers on the hard and difficult path of Progress, who will
            take the places of their predecessors. The next great Manvantara
            will witness the men of our own Life-Cycle becoming the
            instructors and guides of a Mankind whose Monads may now be still
            imprisoned—semi-conscious—in the most intellectual of the animal
            kingdom, while their lower principles may be animating, perhaps,
            the highest specimens of the vegetable world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus proceed
            the cycles of the septenary evolution, in Seven-fold Nature; the

            and the purely material or physical natures. All these evolve and
            progress cyclically, passing from one into another, in a double,
            centrifugal and centripetal, way, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
            in their ultimate essence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em> in their aspects. The
            lowest, of course, is that depending upon and subservient to our

            which manifests periodically, for purposes of the collective
            progress of the countless Lives, the outbreathings of the One
            Life; in order that, through the Ever-Becoming, every cosmic atom
            in this infinite Universe, passing from the formless and the

            the long journey immaculate, descending more and more into sinful
            matter, and having connected himself with every atom in

            suffered in, every form of Life and Being, is only at the bottom
            of the valley of matter, and half through his cycle, when he has

            for all subsequent cosmogonies. The attempt to render in a
            European tongue the grand panorama of the ever periodically
            recurring Law, impressed upon the plastic minds of the first
            Races endowed with Consciousness, by those who reflected the same

            which is the Occult Doctrine. It is not traced on any crumbling
            papyrus of Egypt, nor is it any longer graven on Assyrian tile or
            granite wall. The Books of the Vedânta—the <span class="tei tei-q">“last word of human knowledge”</span>—give out but
            the metaphysical aspect of this world-cosmogony; and their

            the additional possession of a master-key, to enable the student
            to get at their full meaning. The reason for this I venture to

            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> what the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> is to the Jewish
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>. They treat of and
            expound the secret and mystic meaning of the Vedic texts. They
            speak of the origin of the Universe, the nature of Deity, and of
            Spirit and Soul, as also of the metaphysical connection of Mind
            and Matter. In a few words: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">contain</span></span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the beginning and

            since the days of Buddha. If it were otherwise, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span> could not be called
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esoteric</span></em>, since they are now
            openly attached to the Sacred Brâhmanical Books, which have, in
            our present age, become accessible even to the Mlechchhas
            (out-castes) and the European Orientalists. One thing in them—and
            this, in all the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>—invariably and
            constantly points to their ancient origin, and proves
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that they were written, in
            some of their portions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">before</span></em> the caste system became
            the tyrannical institution which it still is; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
            that half of their contents have been eliminated, while some of
            them have been rewritten and abridged. <span class="tei tei-q">“The great Teachers of the higher Knowledge and the
            Brâhmans are continually represented as going to Kshatriya
            [military-caste] kings to become their pupils.”</span> As
            Professor Cowell pertinently remarks, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">“breathe an entirely different spirit [from other
            Brâhmanical writings], a freedom of thought unknown in any
            earlier work, except in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span> hymns
            themselves.”</span> The second fact is explained by a tradition
            recorded in one of the MSS. on Buddha's life. It says that the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span> were originally
            attached to their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span> after the beginning
            of a reform, which led to the exclusiveness of the present caste
            system among the Brâhmans, a few centuries after the invasion of
            India by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Twice-born.”</span> They
            were complete in those days, and were used for the instruction of
            the Chelâs who were preparing for Initiation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This lasted so
            long as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span> remained in the
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg 292]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg292"></a> sole and exclusive
            keeping of the temple-Brâhmans—while no one else had the right to
            study or even read them outside of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred</span></em> caste. Then came Gautama,
            the Prince of Kapilavastu. After <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">learning</span></em> the whole of the
            Brâhmanical wisdom in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rahasya</span></span>, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>, and finding that
            the teachings differed little, if at all, from those of the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Teachers of Life”</span> inhabiting the
            snowy ranges of the Himâlayas,<a href="#note_415" id="noteref_415" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> the
            disciple of the Brâhmans, feeling indignant because the Sacred
            Wisdom was thus withheld from all but Brâhmans, determined, by
            popularizing it, to save the whole world. Then it was that the
            Brâhmans, seeing that their Sacred Knowledge and Occult Wisdom
            was falling into the hands of the Mlechchhas, abridged the texts
            of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>, which originally
            contained thrice the matter of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>
            and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Brâhmanas</span></span> together, without
            altering, however, one word of the texts. They simply detached
            from the MSS. the most important portions, containing the last
            word of the Mystery of Being. The key to the Brâhmanical secret
            code remained henceforth with the Initiates alone, and the
            Brâhmans were thus in a position to publicly deny the correctness
            of Buddha's teaching by appealing to their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>, silenced for ever
            on the chief questions. Such is the esoteric tradition beyond the
            Himâlayas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shrî
            Shankarâchârya, the greatest Initiate living in the historical
            ages, wrote many a Bhâshya (Commentary) on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span>. But his original
            treatises, as there are reasons to suppose, have not yet fallen
            into the hands of the Philistines, for they are too jealously
            preserved in his monasteries (mathams). And there are still
            weightier reasons to believe that the priceless Bhâshyas on the
            Esoteric Doctrine of the Brâhmans, by their greatest expounder,
            will remain for ages still a dead letter to most of the Hindûs,
            except the Smârtava Brâhmans. This sect, founded by
            Shankarâchârya, which is still very powerful in Southern India,
            is now almost the only one to produce students who have preserved
            sufficient knowledge to comprehend the dead letter of the
            Bhâshyas. The reason for this, I am informed, is that they alone
            have occasionally real Initiates at their head in their mathams,
            as for instance, in the Shringa-giri, in the Western Ghâts of
            Mysore. On the other hand, there is no sect, in that desperately
            exclusive <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
            293]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg293"></a>
            caste of the Brâhmans, more exclusive than is the Smârtava; and
            the reticence of its followers, to say what they may know of the
            Occult sciences and the Esoteric Doctrine, is only equalled by
            their pride and learning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore the
            writer of the present statement must be prepared beforehand to
            meet with great opposition, and even the denial of such
            statements as are brought forward in this work. Not that any
            claim to infallibility, or to perfect correctness in every detail
            of all which is herein written, has ever been put forward. Facts
            are there, and they can hardly be denied. But, owing to the
            intrinsic difficulties of the subjects treated of, and the almost
            insurmountable limitations of the English tongue, as of all other
            European languages, to express certain ideas, it is more than
            probable that the writer has failed to present the explanations
            in the best and the clearest form; yet all that could be done,
            under every adverse circumstance, has been done, and this is the
            utmost that can be expected of any writer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us
            recapitulate and, by the vastness of the subjects expounded, show
            how difficult, if not impossible, it is to do them full
            justice.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The Secret
            Doctrine is the accumulated Wisdom of the Ages, and its cosmogony
            alone is the most stupendous and elaborate of all systems, even
            as veiled in the exotericism of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>. But such is the
            mysterious power of Occult symbolism, that the facts which have
            actually occupied countless generations of initiated seers and
            prophets to marshal, set down and explain, in the bewildering
            series of evolutionary progress, are all recorded on a few pages
            of geometrical signs and glyphs. The flashing gaze of those seers
            has penetrated into the very kernel of matter, and recorded the
            soul of things there, where an ordinary profane observer, however
            learned, would have perceived but the external work of form. But
            Modern Science believes not in the <span class="tei tei-q">“soul
            of things,”</span> and hence will reject the whole system of
            ancient cosmogony. It is useless to say that the system in
            question is no fancy of one or several isolated individuals; that
            it is an uninterrupted record, covering thousands of generations
            of seers, whose respective experiences were made to test and
            verify the traditions, passed on orally by one early race to
            another, of the teachings of higher and exalted Beings, who
            watched over the childhood of Humanity; that for long ages, the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Wise Men”</span> of the Fifth Race, of
            the stock saved and rescued from the last cataclysm and the
            shifting of continents, passed their lives <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in learning, not
            teaching</span></em>. How did they do so? It is answered:
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg294"></a> by checking,
            testing, and verifying, in every department of Nature, the
            traditions of old, by the independent visions of great Adepts;
            that is to say, men who have developed and perfected their
            physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual organizations, to the
            utmost possible degree. No vision of one Adept was accepted till
            it was checked and confirmed by the visions—so obtained as to
            stand as independent evidence—of other Adepts, and by centuries
            of experience.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) The
            fundamental law in that system, the central point from which all
            emerges, around and towards which all gravitates, and upon which
            is hung all its philosophy, is the One Homogeneous Divine
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Substance-Principle</span></span>, the

            omnipresent Reality; impersonal, because it contains all and

            conception</span></em> of the System. It is latent in every atom
            in the Universe, and is the Universe itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The

            Essence. To call it <span class="tei tei-q">“Essence,”</span>
            however, is to sin against the very spirit of the philosophy. For
            though the noun may be derived in this case from the verb
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">esse</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“to be,”</span> yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">It</span></span> cannot be identified
            with a <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> of any kind, that
            can be conceived by human intellect. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">It</span></span> is best described as
            neither Spirit nor Matter, but both. Parabrahman and Mûlaprakriti
            are One, in reality, yet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Two</span></span> in the universal
            conception of the Manifested, even in the conception of the One
            Logos, the first <span class="tei tei-q">“Manifestation,”</span>
            to which, as the able lecturer shows, in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Notes on the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavadgîtâ</span></span>,”</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">It</span></span> appears from the
            objective standpoint as Mûlaprakriti, and not as Parabrahman; as
            its Veil, and not the One Reality hidden behind, which is
            unconditioned and absolute.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) The
            Universe, with everything in it, is called Mâyâ, because all is
            temporary therein, from the ephemeral life of a fire-fly to that
            of the sun. Compared to the eternal immutability of the
            <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>, and the
            changelessness of that Principle, the Universe, with its
            evanescent ever-changing forms, must be necessarily, in the mind
            of a philosopher, no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg
            295]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg295"></a>
            better than a will-o'-the-wisp. Yet, the Universe is real enough
            to the conscious beings in it, which are as unreal as it is
            itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) Everything
            in the Universe, throughout all its kingdoms, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious</span></em>: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            endowed with a consciousness of its own kind and on its own plane
            of perception. We men must remember that, simply because
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> do not perceive any signs of
            consciousness which we can recognize, say, in stones, we have no
            right to say that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no consciousness exists there</span></em>.
            There is no such thing as either <span class="tei tei-q">“dead”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“blind”</span> matter, as there is no <span class="tei tei-q">“blind”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious”</span> Law. These find no place among
            the conceptions of Occult Philosophy. The latter never stops at
            surface appearances, and for it the noumenal Essences have more
            reality than their objective counterparts; wherein it resembles
            the system of the mediæval Nominalists, for whom it was the
            universals that were the realities, and the particulars which
            existed only in name and human fancy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) The
            Universe is worked and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">guided</span></em>, from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within
            outwards</span></em>. As above so it is below, as in heaven so on
            earth; and man, the microcosm and miniature copy of the
            macrocosm, is the living witness to this Universal Law, and to
            the mode of its action. We see that every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">external</span></em> motion, act, gesture,
            whether voluntary or mechanical, organic or mental, is produced
            and preceded by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">internal</span></em> feeling or emotion,
            will or volition, and thought or mind. As no outward motion or
            change, when normal, in man's external body, can take place
            unless provoked by an inward impulse, given through one of the
            three functions named, so with the external or manifested
            Universe. The whole Kosmos is guided, controlled, and animated by
            almost endless series of Hierarchies of sentient Beings, each
            having a mission to perform, and who—whether we give them one
            name or another, whether we call them Dhyân Chohans or Angels—are
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Messengers,”</span> in the sense only
            that they are the agents of Karmic and Cosmic Laws. They vary
            infinitely in their respective degrees of consciousness and
            intelligence; and to call them all pure Spirits, without any of
            the earthly alloy <span class="tei tei-q">“which time is wont to
            prey upon,”</span> is only to indulge in poetical fancy. For each
            of these Beings either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>, or prepares to become, a
            man, if not in the present, then in a past or a coming
            Manvantara. They are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perfected</span></em>, when not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incipient</span></em>, men; and in their
            higher, less material, spheres differ morally from terrestrial
            human beings only in that they are devoid of the feeling of
            personality, and of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human</span></em> emotional nature—two
            purely earthly characteristics. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg296"></a> former, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“perfected,”</span> have become free from these
            feelings, because (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) they have no longer fleshly
            bodies—an ever-numbing weight on the Soul; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>),
            the pure spiritual element being left untrammelled and more free,
            they are less influenced by Mâyâ than man can ever be, unless he
            is an Adept who keeps his two personalities—the spiritual and the
            physical—entirely separated. The incipient Monads, having never
            yet had terrestrial bodies, can have no sense of personality or
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ego</span></em>-ism. That which is meant by
            <span class="tei tei-q">“personality”</span> being a limitation
            and a relation, or, as defined by Coleridge, <span class="tei tei-q">“individuality existing in itself but with a nature
            as a ground,”</span> the term cannot of course be applied to
            non-human Entities; but, as a fact insisted upon by generations
            of Seers, none of these Beings, high or low, have either
            individuality or personality as separate Entities, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            they have no individuality in the sense in which a man says,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">I am myself</span></span> and no one
            else”</span>; in other words, they are conscious of no such
            distinct separateness as men and things have on earth.
            Individuality is the characteristic of their respective
            Hierarchies, not of their units; and these characteristics vary
            only with the degree of the plane to which these Hierarchies
            belong: the nearer to the region of Homogeneity and the One
            Divine, the purer and the less accentuated is that individuality
            in the Hierarchy. They are finite in all respects, with the
            exception of their higher principles—the immortal Sparks
            reflecting the Universal Divine Flame, individualized and
            separated only on the spheres of Illusion, by a differentiation
            as illusive as the rest. They are <span class="tei tei-q">“Living
            Ones,”</span> because they are the streams projected on the
            cosmic screen of Illusion from the Absolute Life; Beings in whom
            life cannot become extinct, before the fire of ignorance is
            extinct in those who sense these <span class="tei tei-q">“Lives.”</span> Having sprung into being under the
            quickening influence of the uncreated Beam, the reflection of the
            great Central Sun that radiates on the shores of the River of
            Life, it is the Inner Principle in them which belongs to the
            Waters of Immortality, while its differentiated clothing is as
            perishable as man's body. Therefore Young was right in saying
            that</p>

            are, as <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg

            much as man himself is, the slaves and creatures of immutable
            Karmic and Cosmic Law. The reason for this is evident. Having no
            elements of personality in their essence, they can have no
            personal qualities, such as are attributed by men, in exoteric
            religions, to their anthropomorphic God—a jealous and exclusive
            God, who rejoices and feels wrathful, is pleased with sacrifice,
            and is more despotic in his vanity than any finite foolish man.
            Man, being a compound of the essences of all these celestial
            Hierarchies, may succeed in making himself, as such, superior, in
            one sense, to any Hierarchy or Class, or even combination of
            them. <span class="tei tei-q">“Man can neither propitiate nor
            command the Devas,”</span> it is said. But, by paralyzing his
            lower personality, and arriving thereby at the full knowledge of
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">non-separateness</span></em> of his Higher
            Self from the One Absolute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Self</span></span>, man can, even
            during his terrestrial life, become as <span class="tei tei-q">“one of us.”</span> Thus it is, by eating of the
            fruit of knowledge, which dispels ignorance, that man becomes
            like one of the Elohim, or the Dhyânis; and once on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em>
            plane, the spirit of Solidarity and perfect Harmony, which reigns
            in every Hierarchy, must extend over him, and protect him in
            every particular.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief
            difficulty which prevents men of Science from believing in divine
            as well as in nature spirits is their Materialism. The main
            impediment before the Spiritualist which hinders him from
            believing in the same, while preserving a blind belief in the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirits”</span> of the Departed, is the
            general ignorance of all—except some Occultists and
            Kabalists—about the true essence and nature of Matter. It is on
            the acceptance or rejection of the theory of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Unity of all in
            Nature, in its ultimate Essence</span></span>, that mainly rests
            the belief or unbelief in the existence around us of other
            conscious Beings, besides the Spirits of the Dead. It is on the
            right comprehension of the primeval Evolution of Spirit-Matter,
            and its real Essence, that the student has to depend for the
            further elucidation in his mind of the Occult Cosmogony, and for
            the only sure clue which can guide his subsequent studies.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In sober
            truth, as just shown, every so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit”</span> is either a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">disembodied or a
            future man</span></em>. As from the highest Archangel (Dhyân
            Chohan) down to the last conscious Builder (the inferior Class of
            Spiritual Entities), all such are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">men</span></em>,
            having lived æons ago, in other Manvantaras, on this or other
            Spheres; so the inferior, semi-intelligent and non-intelligent
            Elementals are all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">future</span></em> men. The fact alone, that
            a Spirit is endowed with intelligence, is a proof to the
            Occultist that such a Being must have been a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">man</span></em>,
            and acquired his knowledge <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg298"></a> and intelligence throughout the human
            cycle. There is but one indivisible and absolute Omniscience and
            Intelligence in the Universe, and this thrills throughout every
            atom and infinitesimal point of the whole Kosmos, which has no
            bounds, and which people call Space, considered independently of
            anything contained in it. But the first differentiation of its
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reflection</span></em> in the Manifested
            World is purely spiritual, and the Beings generated in it are not
            endowed with a consciousness that has any relation to the one we
            conceive of. They can have no human consciousness or intelligence
            before they have acquired such, personally and individually. This
            may be a mystery, yet it is a fact in Esoteric Philosophy, and a
            very apparent one too.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole
            order of Nature evinces a progressive march towards a higher
            life. There is design in the action of the seemingly blindest
            forces. The whole process of evolution, with its endless
            adaptations, is a proof of this. The immutable laws that weed out
            the weak and feeble species, to make room for the strong, and
            which ensure the <span class="tei tei-q">“survival of the
            fittest,”</span> though so cruel in their immediate action, all
            are working toward the grand end. The very <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>
            that adaptations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> occur, that the fittest
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> survive in the struggle for
            existence, shows that what is called <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious Nature”</span> is in reality an
            aggregate of forces, manipulated by semi-intelligent beings
            (Elementals), guided by High Planetary Spirits (Dhyân Chohans),
            whose collective aggregate forms the Manifested Verbum of the
            Unmanifested Logos, and constitutes one and the same time the
            Mind of the Universe and its immutable Law.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For Nature,
            taken in its abstract sense, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em>
            be <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious,”</span> as it is the
            emanation from, and thus an aspect on the manifested plane of,
            the Absolute Consciousness. Where is that daring man who would
            presume to deny to vegetation and even to minerals <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a consciousness
            of their own</span></em>? All he can say is, that this
            consciousness is beyond his comprehension.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three distinct
            representations of the Universe, in its three distinct aspects,
            are impressed upon our thoughts by the Esoteric Philosophy: the

            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ever-existing</span></em>, and the
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Phenomenal</span></em>—the world of
            illusion, the reflection, and shadow thereof. During the great
            mystery and drama of life, known as the Manvantara, real Kosmos
            is like the objects placed behind the white screen upon which
            shadows are thrown. The actual figures and things remain
            invisible, while the wires of evolution are pulled by unseen
            hands. Men and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg

            every religion, ante- as well as post-diluvian, in India and
            Chaldea, by the Chinese as by the Grecian Sages. In the former
            countries these three Universes were allegorized, in exoteric
            teachings, by the three Trinities, emanating from the central
            eternal Germ, and forming with it a Supreme Unity: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">initial</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifested</span></em>, and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creative</span></em> Triad, or the Three in
            One. The last is but the symbol, in its concrete expression, of
            the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal</span></em> two. Hence Esoteric
            Philosophy passes over the necessarianism of this purely
            metaphysical conception, and calls the first one, only, the
            Ever-Existing. This is the view of every one of the six great
            schools of Indian philosophy—the six principles of that unit body
            of Wisdom of which the Gnôsis, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hidden</span></em> Knowledge, is the
            seventh.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer
            hopes that, however superficially the comments on the Seven
            Stanzas may have been handled, enough has been given, in this
            cosmogonic portion of the work, to show the archaic teachings to
            be on their very face more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scientific</span></em> (in the modern sense
            of the word) than any other ancient Scriptures left to be judged
            on their exoteric aspect. Since, however, as before confessed,
            this work <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">withholds far more than it gives
            out</span></em>, the student is invited to use his own
            intuitions. Our chief care is to elucidate that which has already
            been given out, and, to our regret, very incorrectly at times; to
            supplement the knowledge hinted at—whenever and wherever
            possible—by additional matter; and to bulwark our doctrines
            against the too strong attacks of modern Sectarianism, and more
            especially against those of our latter-day Materialism, very
            often miscalled Science, whereas, in reality, the words
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Scientists”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Sciolists”</span> ought alone to bear the
            responsibility for the many illogical theories offered to the
            world. In its great ignorance, the public, while blindly
            accepting everything that emanates from <span class="tei tei-q">“authorities,”</span> and feeling it to be its duty
            to regard every <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">dictum</span></span> coming from a man of
            Science as a proven fact—the public, we say, is taught to scoff
            at anything brought forward from <span class="tei tei-q">“heathen”</span> sources. Therefore, as materialistic
            Scientists can be fought solely with their own weapons—those of
            controversy and argument—an Addendum is added to each Volume
            contrasting the respective views, and showing how even great
            authorities may often err. We believe that this can be done
            effectually, by showing the weak points of our opponents, and by
            proving their too frequent sophisms, which are made to pass for
            scientific <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg
            300]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg300"></a>
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">dicta</span></span>, to be incorrect. We
            hold to Hermes and his <span class="tei tei-q">“Wisdom,”</span>
            in its universal character; they—to Aristotle, as against
            intuition and the experience of the Ages, fancying that Truth is
            the exclusive property of the Western world. Hence the
            disagreement. As Hermes says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Knowledge
            differs much from sense; for sense is of things that surmount it,
            but Knowledge is the end of sense”</span>—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            of the illusion of our physical brain and its intellect; thus
            emphasizing the contrast between the laboriously acquired
            knowledge of the senses and Mind (Manas), and the intuitive
            omniscience of the Spiritual Divine Soul (Buddhi).</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may
            be the destiny of these actual writings in a remote future, we
            hope to have so far proven the following facts:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1) The Secret
            Doctrine teaches no Atheism, except in the sense underlying the
            Sanskrit word Nâstika, a rejection of idols, including every
            anthropomorphic God. In this sense every Occultist is a
            Nâstika.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) It admits
            a Logos, or a Collective <span class="tei tei-q">“Creator”</span>
            of the Universe; a Demiurge, in the sense implied when one speaks
            of an <span class="tei tei-q">“Architect”</span> as the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Creator”</span> of an edifice, whereas
            that Architect has never touched one stone of it, but, furnishing
            the plan, has left all the manual labour to the masons; in our
            case the plan was furnished by the Ideation of the Universe, and
            the constructive labour was left to the Hosts of intelligent
            Powers and Forces. But that Demiurge is no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> deity—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
            an imperfect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extra-cosmic God</span></em>, but only the
            aggregate of the Dhyân Chohans and the other Forces.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(3) The Dhyân
            Chohans are dual in their character; being composed of
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the irrational <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brute
            Energy</span></em>, inherent in Matter, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
            the intelligent Soul, or cosmic Consciousness, which directs and
            guides that Energy, and which is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dhyân Chohanic
            Thought, reflecting the Ideation of the Universal
            Mind</span></span>. This results in a perpetual series of
            physical manifestations and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moral effects</span></em> on Earth, during
            manvantaric periods, the whole being subservient to Karma. As
            that process is not always perfect; and since, however many
            proofs it may exhibit of a guiding Intelligence behind the veil,
            it still shows gaps and flaws, and even very often results in
            evident failures—therefore, neither the collective Host
            (Demiurge), nor any of the working Powers individually, are
            proper subjects for divine honours or worship. All are entitled
            to the grateful reverence of humanity, however, and man ought to
            be ever striving to help the divine evolution of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ideas</span></em>, by becoming, to the best
            of his ability, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">co-worker with Nature</span></em>, in the
            cyclic task. The ever <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg
            301]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg301"></a>
            unknowable and incognizable Kârana alone, the Causeless Cause of
            all causes, should have its shrine and altar on the holy and ever
            untrodden ground of our heart—invisible, intangible, unmentioned,
            save through the <span class="tei tei-q">“still small
            voice”</span> of our spiritual consciousness. Those who worship
            before it, ought to do so in the silence and the sanctified
            solitude of their Souls; making their Spirit the sole mediator
            between them and the Universal Spirit, their good actions the
            only priests, and their sinful intentions the only visible and
            objective sacrificial victims to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Presence</span></em>.</p>

            God”</span> and of Heaven is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>
            us, says Jesus, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">outside</span></em>. Why are Christians so
            absolutely blind to the self-evident meaning of the words of
            wisdom they delight in mechanically repeating?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) Matter is
            Eternal. It is the Upâdhi, or Physical Basis, for the One
            Infinite Universal Mind to build thereon its ideations.
            Therefore, the Esotericists maintain that there is no inorganic
            or <span class="tei tei-q">“dead”</span> matter in Nature, the
            distinction between the two made by Science being as unfounded as
            it is arbitrary and devoid of reason. Whatever Science may think,
            however—and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exact</span></em> Science is a fickle dame,
            as we all know by experience—Occultism knows and teaches
            differently, as it has done from time immemorial, from Manu and
            Hermes down to Paracelsus and his successors.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, Hermes,
            the Thrice Great, says:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this the
            late Dr. Anna Kingsford, the able translator and compiler of the
            Hermetic Fragments, remarks in a footnote:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(5) The
            Universe was evolved out of its ideal plan, upheld through
            Eternity in the Unconsciousness of that which the Vedântins call
            Parabrahman. This is practically identical with the conclusions
            of the highest Western philosophy, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            innate, eternal, and self-existing Ideas”</span> of Plato, now
            reflected by Von Hartmann. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable”</span> of Herbert Spencer bears but a
            faint resemblance to that transcendental Reality believed in by
            Occultists, often appearing merely a personification of a
            <span class="tei tei-q">“force behind phenomena”</span>—an
            infinite and eternal Energy, from which all things proceed,
            whereas the author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophy of the Unconscious</span></span>
            has come (in this respect only) as near to a solution of the
            great Mystery as mortal man can. Few have been those, whether in
            ancient or mediæval philosophy, who have dared to approach the
            subject or even hint at it. Paracelsus mentions it inferentially,
            and his ideas are admirably synthesized by Dr. F. Hartmann,
            F.T.S., in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paracelsus</span></span>, from which we have
            just quoted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the
            Christian Kabalists understood well the Eastern root idea. The
            active Power, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Perpetual Motion of
            the great Breath,”</span> only awakens Cosmos at the dawn of
            every new Period, setting it into motion by means of the two
            contrary Forces, the centripetal and the centrifugal Forces,
            which are male and female, positive and negative, physical and
            spiritual, the two being the one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Primordial</span></span> Force, and thus
            causing it to become objective on the plane of Illusion. In other
            words, that dual motion transfers Cosmos from the plane of the
            Eternal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
            303]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg303"></a>
            Ideal into that of finite manifestation, or from the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">noumenal</span></em> to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenal</span></em> plane. Everything
            that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>,
            and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will be</span></em>, eternally <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">IS</span></span>, even the countless
            Forms, which are finite and perishable only in their objective,
            but not in their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ideal</span></em> form. They existed as
            Ideas, in the Eternity, and, when they pass away, will exist as
            reflections. Occultism teaches that no form can be given to
            anything, either by Nature or by man, whose ideal type does not
            already exist on the subjective plane: more than this; that no
            form or shape can possibly enter man's consciousness, or evolve
            in his imagination, which does not exist in prototype, at least
            as an approximation. Neither the form of man, nor that of any
            animal, plant or stone, has ever been <span class="tei tei-q">“created”</span>; and it is only on this plane of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is quite
            consistent with the Vedântic teaching. The leading thought is
            Occult; and many are the passages in the Hermetic Fragments that
            belong bodily to the Secret Doctrine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Doctrine
            teaches that the whole Universe is ruled by intelligent and
            semi-intelligent Forces and Powers, as stated from the very
            beginning. Christian Theology admits and even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">enforces</span></em> belief in such, but
            makes an arbitrary division and refers to them as <span class="tei tei-q">“Angels”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Devils.”</span> Science denies the existence of
            both, and ridicules the very idea. Spiritualists believe in the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirits of the Dead,”</span> and outside
            these deny entirely any other kind or class of invisible beings.
            The Occultists and Kabalists are thus the only rational
            expounders of the ancient traditions, which have now culminated
            in dogmatic faith on the one hand, and dogmatic denial on the
            other. For both belief and unbelief each embrace but one small
            corner of the infinite horizons of spiritual and physical
            manifestations: and thus both are right from their respective
            standpoints, yet both are wrong in believing that they can
            circumscribe the whole within their own special and narrow
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg308"></a> barriers, for—they
            can never do so. In this respect, Science, Theology, and even
            Spiritualism show little more wisdom than the ostrich, when it
            hides its head in the sand at its feet, feeling sure that there
            can be thus nothing beyond its own point of observation and the
            limited area occupied by its foolish head.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the only
            works now extant upon the subject under consideration, within
            reach of the profane of the Western <span class="tei tei-q">“civilized”</span> races, are the above-mentioned
            Hermetic Books, or rather Hermetic Fragments, we may contrast
            them in the present case with the teachings of Esoteric
            Philosophy. To quote for this purpose from any other would be
            useless, since the public knows nothing of the Chaldean works,
            which are translated into Arabic and preserved by some Sufi
            Initiates. Therefore the <span class="tei tei-q">“Definitions of
            Asclepios,”</span> as lately compiled and glossed by Dr. Anna
            Kingsford, F.T.S., some of which sayings are in remarkable
            agreement with the Eastern Esoteric Doctrine, have to be resorted
            to for comparison. Though not a few passages bear a strong
            impression of some later Christian hand, yet on the whole the
            characteristics of the Genii and Gods are those of Eastern
            teachings, although concerning other things there are passages
            which differ widely in our doctrines.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the
            Genii, the Hermetic philosophers called Theoi (Gods), Genii and
            Daimones, those Entities whom we call Devas (Gods), Dhyân
            Chohans, Chitkala (the Kwan-Yin, of the Buddhists), and various
            other names. The Daimones are—in the Socratic sense, and even in
            the Oriental and Latin theological sense—the guardian spirits of
            the human race; <span class="tei tei-q">“those who dwell in the
            neighbourhood of the immortals, and thence watch over human
            affairs,”</span> as Hermes has it. In Esoteric parlance, they are
            called Chitkala, some of which are those who have furnished man
            with his fourth and fifth Principles from their own essence, and
            others the so-called Pitris. This will be explained when we come
            to the production of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">complete man</span></em>. The root of the
            name is Chit, <span class="tei tei-q">“that by which the
            consequences of acts and species of knowledge are selected for
            the use of the soul,”</span> or conscience, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner
            voice</span></em> in man. With the Yogins, Chit is a synonym of
            Mahat, the first and divine Intellect; but in Esoteric Philosophy
            Mahat is the root of Chit, its germ; and Chit is a quality of
            Manas in conjunction with Buddhi, a quality that attracts to
            itself by spiritual affinity a Chitkala, when it develops
            sufficiently in man. This is why it is said that Chit is a voice
            acquiring mystic life and becoming Kwan-Yin.</p>

            be an Illusion, most undeniably. But this is only so from the
            purely metaphysical view. A man who regards himself as mentally
            sane, and is so regarded by his neighbours, calls the visions of
            an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">insane</span></em> brother—hallucinations

            Everything is relative in this Universe, everything is an
            Illusion. But the experience of any plane is an actuality for the
            percipient being, whose consciousness is on that plane, though
            the said experience, regarded from the purely metaphysical
            standpoint, may be conceived to have no objective reality. But it
            is not against Metaphysicians, but against Physicists and
            Materialists that Esoteric teaching has to fight; and for these
            latter Vital Force, Light, Sound, Electricity, even to the
            objectively drawing force of Magnetism, have no objective being,
            and are said to exist merely as <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of

            Occultists generally, nor the Theosophists, reject, as
            erroneously believed by some, the views and theories of the
            Modern Scientists only because these views are opposed to
            Theosophy. The first rule of our Society is to render unto Cæsar
            what is Cæsar's. Theosophists, therefore, are the first to
            recognize the intrinsic value of Science. But when its high
            priests resolve consciousness into a secretion from the grey
            matter of the brain, and everything else in Nature into a mode of
            motion, we protest against the doctrine as being unphilosophical,
            self-contradictory, and simply absurd, from a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scientific</span></em> point of view, as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These secrets
            of the Astral Light, along with many other mysteries, will remain
            non-existent to the Materialists of our age, in the same way as
            America was a non-existent myth for Europeans during the early
            part of the mediæval ages, whereas Scandinavians and Norwegians
            had actually reached and settled in that very old <span class="tei tei-q">“New World”</span> several centuries before. But, as
            a Columbus was born to re-discover, and to force the Old World to
            believe in antipodal countries, so will there be born Scientists
            who will discover the marvels now claimed by Occultists to exist
            in the regions of Ether, with their varied and multiform denizens
            and conscious Entities. Then, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nolens

            <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition,”</span> as it has several
            others. And having been once forced to accept it, its learned
            professors in all probability—judging from past experience, as in
            the case of Mesmerism and Magnetism, now re-baptized
            Hypnotism—will father the thing and reject the name. The choice
            of the new appellation will, in its turn, depend on the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of motion”</span>—the new name for
            the older <span class="tei tei-q">“automatic physical processes
            among the nerve fibrils of the [scientific] brain”</span> of
            Moleschott—and also, most likely, upon the last meal of the
            namer, since, according to the founder of the new Hylo-Idealistic
            Scheme, <span class="tei tei-q">“cerebration is generically the

            Thus, were one to believe this preposterous proposition, the new
            name of the archaic truth would have to take its chance on the
            inspiration of the namer's liver, and then only would these
            truths have a chance of becoming scientific!</p>

            will protest against its adoption by Science under whatever
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg317"></a> new name. But
            until absolutely forced on the notice and acceptance of
            Scientists, many an Occult truth will be tabooed, as the
            phenomena of the Spiritualists and other psychic manifestations
            were, to be finally appropriated by its ex-traducers without the
            least acknowledgment or thanks. Nitrogen has added considerably

            non-evolutionists, and such explanations are still accepted by
            the British public, that gets its thinking done for it by proxy.
            Professor Max Müller, Cox, Gubernatis, and other propounders of
            the Solar Mythos, have portrayed the primitive myth-maker for us
            as a sort of Germanised-Hindû metaphysician, projecting his own
            shadow on a mental mist, and talking ingeniously concerning
            smoke, or, at least,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">cloud</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">;
            the sky overhead becoming like the dome of dreamland, scribbled
            over with the imagery of aboriginal nightmares! They conceive the
            early man in their own likeness, and look upon him as perversely
            prone to self-mystification, or, as Fontenelle has it,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">subject to

            They have misrepresented primitive or archaic man as having been
            idiotically misled from the first by an active but untutored
            imagination into believing all sorts of fallacies, which were
            directly and constantly contradicted by his own daily experience;
            a fool of fancy in the midst of those grim realities that were
            grinding his experiences into him, like the griding icebergs
            making their imprints upon the rocks submerged beneath the sea.
            It remains to be said, and will one day be acknowledged, that
            these accepted teachers have been no nearer to the beginnings of
            mythology and language than Burns's poet Willie had been near to
            Pegasus. My reply is, 'Tis but a dream of the metaphysical
            theorist that mythology was a disease of language, or of anything
            else except his own brain. The origin and meaning of mythology
            have been missed altogether by these solarites and
            weather-mongers! Mythology was a primitive mode of</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">thinking</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">the early thought. It was founded on
            natural facts, and is still verifiable in phenomena. There is
            nothing insane, nothing irrational in it, when considered in the
            light of evolution, and when its mode of expression by
            sign-language is thoroughly understood. The insanity lies in
            mistaking it for human history or Divine Revelation.</span><a href="#note_453" id="noteref_453" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Mythology is the repository of man's
            most ancient science, and what concerns us chiefly is this—when
            truly interpreted once more, it is destined to be the death of
            those false theologies to which it has unwittingly given
            birth!</span><a href="#note_454" id="noteref_454" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">In modern phraseology a statement is sometimes
            said to be mythical in proportion to its being untrue; but the
            ancient mythology was not a system or mode of falsifying in that
            sense. Its fables were the means of conveying facts; they were
            neither forgeries nor fictions.... For example, when the
            Egyptians portrayed the moon as a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">cat</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, they were not ignorant enough to suppose that
            the moon was a cat; nor did their wandering fancies see any
            likeness in the moon to a cat; nor was a cat-myth any</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mere expansion of verbal
            metaphor</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; nor had they
            any intention of</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg
            323]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg323"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">making puzzles
            or riddles.... They had observed the simple fact that the cat saw
            in the dark, and that her eyes became full-orbed, and grew most
            luminous by night. The moon was the seer by night in heaven, and
            the cat was its equivalent on the earth; and so the familiar cat
            was adopted as a representative, a natural sign, a living
            pictograph of the lunar orb.... And so it followed that the sun
            which saw down in the under-world at night could also be called
            the cat, as it was, because</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">it also saw</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">in the dark. The name of the cat in
            Egyptian is</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mau</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
            which denotes the seer, from</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mau</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
            to see. One writer on mythology asserts that the Egyptians</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">imagined a
            great cat behind the sun, which is the pupil of the cat's
            eye.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">But this imagining is all modern. It
            is the Müllerite stock in trade. The moon,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">as cat, was</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">the eye of the sun,</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">because it reflected the
            solar light</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, and because
            the eye gives back the image in its mirror. In the form of the
            goddess Pasht, the cat keeps watch for the sun, with her paw
            holding down and bruising the head of the serpent of darkness,
            called his eternal enemy!</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a very
          correct exposition of the lunar mythos from its astronomical
          aspect. Selenography, however, is the least esoteric of the
          divisions of lunar Symbology. To master thoroughly—if one is
          permitted to coin a new word—Selenognosis, one must become
          proficient in more than its astronomical meaning. The Moon is
          intimately related to the Earth, as shown in the Stanzas, and is
          more directly concerned with all the mysteries of our Globe than is
          even Venus-Lucifer, the occult sister and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">alter
          ego</span></span> of the Earth.<a href="#note_455" id="noteref_455" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The untiring
          researches of Western, especially German, symbologists, during the
          last and the present centuries, have induced the most unprejudiced
          students, and of course every Occultist, to see that without the
          help of symbology—with its seven departments, of which the moderns
          know nothing—no ancient Scripture can ever be correctly understood.
          Symbology must be studied from every one of its aspects, for each
          nation had its own peculiar methods of expression. In short, no
          Egyptian papyrus, no Indian olla, no Assyrian tile, no Hebrew
          scroll, should be read and interpreted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">literally</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This every
          scholar now knows. The able lectures of Mr. Gerald Massey alone are
          sufficient to convince any fair-minded Christian that to accept the
          dead-letter of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> is equivalent to falling
          into a grosser error and superstition than any hitherto evolved by
          the brain of the savage South Sea Islander. But the fact to which
          even the most truth-loving and truth-searching Orientalists—whether
          Âryanists or Egyptologists—seem to remain blind, is that every
          symbol on papyrus or olla is a many-faced diamond, each of whose
          facets not only includes several interpretations, but also relates
          to several sciences. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg
          324]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg324"></a>
          This is instanced in the just quoted interpretation of the cat
          symbolizing the moon—an example of sidereo-terrestrial imagery; for
          the moon has with other nations many other meanings besides.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a learned
          Mason and Theosophist, the late Kenneth Mackenzie, has shown in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Royal
          Masonic Cyclopædia</span></span>, there is a great difference
          between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">emblem</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">symbol</span></em>.
          The former <span class="tei tei-q">“comprises a larger series of
          thoughts than a symbol, which may be said rather to illustrate some
          single special idea.”</span> Hence, the symbols—lunar, or solar,
          for example—of several countries, each illustrating such a special
          idea, or series of ideas, form collectively an esoteric emblem. The
          latter is <span class="tei tei-q">“a concrete visible picture or
          sign representing principles, or a series of principles, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognizable by
          those who have received certain instructions</span></em>
          [Initiates].”</span> To put it still plainer, an emblem is usually
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a series
          of graphic pictures</span></em> viewed and explained allegorically,
          and unfolding an idea in panoramic views, one after the other. Thus
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> are written emblems. So
          are the Mosaic and Christian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testaments</span></span>, or the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>,
          and all other exoteric Scriptures. As the same authority shows:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">All esoteric societies have made use of emblems
          and symbols, such as the Pythagorean Society, the Eleusinia, the
          Hermetic Brethren of Egypt, the Rosicrucians, and the Freemasons.
          Many of these emblems it is not proper to divulge to the general
          eye, and</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a very minute
          difference</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">may make the
          emblem or symbol differ widely in its meaning. The magical sigilla,
          being founded on certain principles of number, partake of this
          character, and although monstrous or ridiculous in the eyes of the
          uninstructed, convey a whole body of doctrine to those who have
          been trained to recognize them.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above
          enumerated societies are all comparatively modern, none dating back
          earlier than the Middle Ages. How much more proper, then, that the
          students of the oldest archaic school should be careful not to
          divulge secrets of far more importance to humanity (as being
          dangerous in ignorant hands) than any of the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Masonic Secrets,”</span> which have now become those
          of Polichinelle, as the French say! But this restriction can apply
          only to the psychological or rather psycho-physiological and
          cosmical significance of symbol and emblem, and even to that only
          partially. For though an Adept is compelled to refuse to impart the
          conditions and means that lead to any correlation of
          Elements—whether psychic or physical—which may produce harmful as
          well as beneficent results; yet he is ever ready to impart to the
          earnest student the secret of the ancient thought, in anything that
          has respect to history concealed under mythological symbolism, and
          thus to furnish a few more land-marks for a retrospective view of
          the past, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg
          325]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg325"></a>
          in so far as it furnishes useful information with regard to the
          origin of man, the evolution of the Races and geognosy. And yet it
          is the crying complaint to-day, not only among Theosophists, but
          also among the few profane interested in the subject: Why do not
          the Adepts reveal that which they know? To this, one might answer:
          Why should they, since one knows beforehand that no man of Science
          will accept it, even as a hypothesis, much less as a theory or
          axiom. Have you so much as accepted or believed in the A B C of the
          Occult Philosophy contained in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theosophist</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric
          Buddhism</span></span>, and other works and periodicals? Has not
          even the little which has been given, been ridiculed and derided,
          and made to face the <span class="tei tei-q">“animal-”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ape-theory”</span> of Huxley and Hæckel,
          on the one hand, and the rib of Adam and the apple on the other?
          Notwithstanding such an unenviable prospect, however, a mass of
          facts is given in the present work, and the origin of man, the
          evolution of the Globe and the Races, human and animal, are as
          fully treated as the writer is able to treat them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proofs
          brought forward in corroboration of the old teachings are scattered
          widely throughout the old scriptures of ancient civilizations. The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zend
          Avesta</span></span>, and the old classics, are full of such facts;
          but no one has ever taken the trouble of collecting and collating
          them together. The reason for this is that all such events were
          recorded symbolically; and that the best scholars, the most acute
          minds, among our Âryanists and Egyptologists, have been too often
          darkened by one or another preconception, and still oftener, by
          one-sided views of the secret meaning. Yet even a parable is a
          spoken symbol: a fiction or a fable, as some think; an allegorical
          representation, we say, of life-realities, events, and facts. And
          just as a moral was ever drawn from a parable, such moral being an
          actual truth and fact in human life, so a historical, real event
          was deduced, by those versed in the hieratic sciences, from emblems
          and symbols recorded in the ancient archives of the temples. The
          religious and esoteric history of every nation was embedded in
          symbols; it was never expressed literally in so many words. All the
          thoughts and emotions, all the learning and knowledge, revealed and
          acquired, of the early Races, found their pictorial expression in
          allegory and parable. Why? Because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the spoken word has a
          potency not only unknown to, but even unsuspected and naturally
          disbelieved in</span></span>, by the modern <span class="tei tei-q">“sages.”</span> Because sound and rhythm are closely
          related to the four Elements of the Ancients; and because such or
          another vibration in the air is sure to awaken the corresponding
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg326"></a> Powers, union with
          which produces good or bad results, as the case may be. No student
          was ever allowed to recite historical, religious, or real events of
          any kind, in so many unmistakable words, lest the Powers connected
          with the event should be once more attracted. Such events were
          narrated only during Initiation, and every student had to record
          them in corresponding symbols, drawn out of his own mind and
          examined later by his Master, before they were finally accepted.
          Thus by degrees was the Chinese Alphabet created, as just before it
          the hieratic symbols were fixed upon in old Egypt. In the Chinese
          language, the characters of which may be read in any language, and
          which, as just said, is only a little less ancient than the
          Egyptian alphabet of Thoth, every word has its corresponding symbol
          in a pictorial form. This language possesses many thousands of such
          symbol-letters, or logograms, each conveying the meaning of a whole
          word; for letters proper, or an alphabet as we understand it, do
          not exist in the Chinese language, any more than they did in the
          Egyptian, till a far later period.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus a Japanese
          who does not understand one word of Chinese, meeting with a
          Chinaman who has never heard the language of the former, will
          communicate in writing with him, and they will understand each
          other perfectly—because their writing is symbolical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation
          of the chief symbols and emblems is now attempted, as Book II,
          which treats of Anthropogenesis, would be most difficult to
          understand without a preparatory acquaintance with at least the
          metaphysical symbols.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor would it be
          just to enter upon an esoteric reading of symbolism, without giving
          due honour to one who has rendered it the greatest service in this
          century, by discovering the chief key to ancient Hebrew symbology,
          strongly interwoven with metrology, one of the keys to the once
          universal Mystery Language. Mr. Ralston Skinner, of Cincinnati, the
          author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Key to the Hebrew-Egyptian Mystery in the
          Source of Measures</span></span>, has our thanks. A Mystic and a
          Kabalist by nature, he has laboured for many years in this
          direction, and his efforts have certainly been crowned with great
          success. In his own words:</p>

          ancient language which modernly and up to this time appears to have
          been lost, the vestiges of which, however, abundantly exist.... The
          author discovered that this geometrical ratio [the integral ratio
          of the diameter to the circumference of a circle] was the very
          ancient, and probably the divine origin of ... linear measures....
          It appears almost proven that the same system of geometry, numbers,
          ratio, and measures</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg327"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">was known and
          made use of on the continent of North America, even prior to the
          knowledge of the same by the descending Semites....</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The peculiarity of this language was that it
            could be contained in another, concealed and not to be perceived,
            save through the help of special instruction; letters and
            syllabic signs possessing at the same time the powers or meanings
            of numbers, of geometrical shapes, pictures, or ideographs and
            symbols, the designed scope of which would be determinatively
            helped out by parables in the shape of narratives or parts of
            narratives; while also it could be set forth separately,
            independently, and variously, by pictures, in stone work, or in
            earth constructions.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">To clear up an ambiguity as to the term
            language: Primarily the word means the expression of ideas by
            human speech; but, secondarily, it may mean the expression of
            ideas by any other instrumentality. This old language is so
            composed in the Hebrew text, that by the use of the written
            characters, which uttered shall be the language first defined, a
            distinctly separated series of ideas may be intentionally
            communicated, other than those ideas expressed by the reading of
            the sound-signs. This secondary language sets forth, under a
            veil, series of ideas, copies in imagination of things sensible,
            which may be pictured, and of things which may be classed as real
            without being sensible: as, for instance, the number 9 may be
            taken as a reality, though it has no sensible existence, so also
            a revolution of the moon, as separated from the moon itself by
            which that revolution has been made, may be taken as giving rise
            to, or causing a real idea, though such a revolution has no
            substance. This idea-language may consist of symbols restricted
            to arbitrary terms and signs, having a very limited range of
            conceptions, and quite valueless, or it may be a reading of
            nature in some of her manifestations of a value almost
            immeasurable, as regards human civilization. A picture of
            something natural may give rise to ideas of coördinating
            subjects, radiating out in various and even opposing directions,
            like the spokes of a wheel, and producing natural realities in
            departments very foreign to the apparent tendency of the reading
            of the first or starting picture. Notion may give rise to
            connected notion, but if it does, then, however apparently
            incongruous, all resulting ideas must spring from the original
            picture and be harmonically connected, or related the one with
            the other. Thus with a pictured idea radical enough, the
            imagination of the cosmos itself, even in its details of
            construction, might result. Such a use of ordinary language is
            now obsolete, but it has become a question with the writer
            whether at one time, far back in the past, it, or such, was not
            the language of the world and of universal use, possessed,
            however, as it became more and more moulded into its arcane
            forms, by a select class or caste. By this I mean that the
            popular tongue or vernacular commenced even in its origin to be
            made use of as the vehicle of this peculiar mode of conveying
            ideas. Of this the evidences are very strong; and, indeed, it
            would seem that in the history of the human race there happened,
            from causes which at present, at any rate, we cannot trace, a
            lapse or loss from an original perfect language and a perfect
            system of science—shall we say perfect because they were of
            divine origin and importation?</span><a href="#note_456" id="noteref_456" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Divine origin”</span> does not here mean a revelation
          from an anthropomorphic God on a mount amidst thunder and
          lightning; but, as we understand it, a language and a system of
          science imparted to early mankind by a more advanced mankind, so
          much higher as to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em> in the sight of that infant
          humanity: by a <span class="tei tei-q">“mankind,”</span> in short,
          from other spheres; an idea which contains nothing supernatural in
          it, but the acceptance or rejection of which depends upon the
          degree of conceit and arrogance in the mind of him to whom it is
          stated. For, if the professors of modern knowledge would only
          confess that, though they know nothing of the future of the
          disembodied man—or rather will accept nothing—yet this future may
          be pregnant with surprises and unexpected revelations to them, once
          their Egos are rid of their gross bodies—then materialistic
          unbelief would have fewer chances than it has. Who of them knows,
          or can tell, what may happen when once the Life-Cycle of this Globe
          is run down, and our mother Earth herself falls into her last
          sleep? Who is bold enough to say that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em>
          Egos of our mankind—at least the elect out of the multitudes
          passing on to other spheres—will not become in their turn the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“divine”</span> instructors of a new
          mankind generated by them on a new Globe, called to life and
          activity by the disembodied <span class="tei tei-q">“principles”</span> of our Earth? All this may have
          been the experience of the Past, and these strange records lie
          embedded in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystery Language”</span>
          of the pre-historic ages, the language now called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Symbolism</span></span>.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Section II. The Mystery Language and
          Its Keys.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Recent
          discoveries made by great mathematicians and Kabalists thus prove,
          beyond a shadow of doubt, that every theology, from the earliest
          down to the latest, has sprung, not only from a common source of
          abstract beliefs, but from one universal Esoteric, or Mystery,
          Language. These scholars hold the key to the universal language of
          old, and have turned it successfully, though only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once</span></em>,
          in the hermetically closed door leading to the Hall of Mysteries.
          The great archaic system known from prehistoric ages as the sacred
          Wisdom-Science, one that is contained and can be traced in every
          old as well as in every new religion, had, and still has, its
          universal language—suspected by the Mason Ragon—the language of the
          Hierophants, which has seven <span class="tei tei-q">“dialects,”</span> so to speak, each referring, and
          being specially appropriate, to one of the seven mysteries of
          Nature. Each had its own symbolism. Nature could thus be either
          read in its fulness, or viewed from one of its special aspects.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proof of
          this lies, to this day, in the extreme difficulty which the
          Orientalists in general, and the Indianists and Egyptologists in
          particular, experience in interpreting the allegorical writings of
          the Âryans and the hieratic records of old Egypt. This is because
          they will never remember that all the ancient records were written
          in a language which was universal and known to all nations alike in
          days of old, but which is now intelligible only to the few. Like
          the Arabic figures which are understandable to men of every nation,
          or like the English word <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></span>, which becomes <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">et</span></span> for
          the Frenchman, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">und</span></span> for the German, and so on,
          yet which may be expressed for all civilized nations in the simple
          sign &amp;—so all the words of that Mystery Language signified the
          same thing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg
          330]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg330"></a>
          to each man, of whatever nationality. There have been several men
          of note who have tried to reëstablish such a universal and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophical</span></em> tongue, Delgarme,
          Wilkins, Leibnitz; but Demaimieux, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pasigraphie</span></span>, is the only one who
          has proven its possibility. The scheme of Valentinius, called the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Greek Kabalah,”</span> based on the
          combination of Greek letters, might serve as a model.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The many-sided
          facets of the Mystery Language have led to the adoption of widely
          varied dogmas and rites in the exotericism of the Church rituals.
          It is these, again, which are at the origin of most of the dogmas
          of the Christian Church; for instance, the seven Sacraments, the
          Trinity, the Resurrection, the seven Capital Sins and the seven
          Virtues. The Seven Keys to the Mystery Tongue, however, having
          always been in the keeping of the highest among the initiated
          Hierophants of antiquity; it is only the partial use of a few out
          of the seven which passed, through the treason of some early Church
          Fathers—ex-Initiates of the Temples—into the hands of the new sect
          of the Nazarenes. Some of the early Popes were Initiates, but the
          last fragments of their knowledge have now fallen into the power of
          the Jesuits, who have turned them into a system of sorcery.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is maintained
          that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">India</span></span>—not confined to its
          present limits, but including its ancient boundaries—is the only
          country in the world which still has among her sons Adepts, who
          have the knowledge of all the seven sub-systems and the key to the
          entire system. From the fall of Memphis, Egypt began to lose these
          keys one by one, and Chaldæa had preserved only three in the days
          of Berosus. As for the Hebrews, in all their writings they show no
          more than a thorough knowledge of the astronomical, geometrical and
          numerical systems of symbolizing the human, and especially the
          physiological functions. They never had the higher keys.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">M. Gaston
          Maspero, the great French Egyptologist and the successor of
          Mariette Bey, writes:</p>

<span style="font-size: 90%">of the Egyptian religions they are
            talking about? Is it of the Egyptian religion of the fourth
            dynasty, or of the Egyptian religion of the Ptolemaic period? Is
            it of the religion of the rabble, or of that of the learned? Of
            the religion such as was taught in the schools of Heliopolis, or
            of that which was in the minds and conceptions of the Theban
            sacerdotal class? For, between the first Memphite tomb, which
            bears the</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">cartouche</span></span>

            Arabian, there is an interval of at least five thousand years.
            Leaving aside the invasion of the Shepherds, the</span>

            conquest, Greek colonization, and the thousand revolutions of its
            political life, Egypt had passed during those five thousand years
            through many vicissitudes of life, moral and intellectual.
            Chapter XVII of the</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Book of the
            Dead</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, which seems to
            contain the exposition of the system of the world, as it was
            understood at Heliopolis during the time of the first dynasties,
            is known to us by a few copies of the eleventh and twelfth
            dynasties. Every one of the verses composing it was already
            interpreted in three or four different ways; so different,
            indeed, that according to this or another school, the Demiurge
            became either the solar fire—Ra-shoo, or the primordial water.
            Fifteen centuries later, the number of readings had increased
            considerably. Time, in its course, had modified their ideas about
            the universe and the forces that ruled it. In the short eighteen
            centuries that Christianity has existed, it has worked up,
            developed and transformed most of its dogmas; how many times,
            then, might not the Egyptian priesthood have altered their dogmas
            during those fifty centuries that separate Theodosius from the
            King Builders of the Pyramids.</span><a href="#note_457" id="noteref_457" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we believe
          the eminent Egyptologist is going too far. The exoteric dogmas may
          often have been altered, the esoteric never. He does not take into
          account the sacred immutability of the primitive truths, revealed
          only during the mysteries of Initiation. The Egyptian priests
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had
          forgotten much, they altered nothing</span></em>. The loss of a
          great part of the primitive teaching was due to the sudden deaths
          of the great Hierophants, who passed away before they had time to
          reveal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> to their successors, mostly in
          the absence of worthy heirs to the knowledge. Yet they have
          preserved in their rituals and dogmas the principal teachings of
          the Secret Doctrine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, in the
          Chapter of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the Dead</span></span>, mentioned by
          Maspero, we find (1) Osiris saying he is Toom—the creative force in
          Nature, giving form to all beings, spirits and men, self-generated
          and self-existent—issued from Noon, the celestial river, called
          Father-Mother of the Gods, the primordial deity, which is Chaos or
          the Deep, impregnated by the unseen Spirit. (2) He has found Shoo,
          the solar force, on the Stairway in the City of the Eight (the two
          squares of Good and Evil), and he has annihilated the Children of
          Rebellion, the evil principles in Noon (Chaos). (3) He is the Fire
          and Water, Noon the Primordial Parent, and he created the Gods out
          of his Limbs—fourteen Gods (twice seven), seven dark and seven
          light Gods—the seven Spirits of the Presence of the Christians, and
          the seven dark Evil Spirits.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(4) He is the
          Law of Existence and Being, the Bennoo, or Phœnix, the Bird of
          Resurrection in Eternity, in whom Night follows Day, and Day
          Night—an allusion to the periodical cycles of cosmic resurrection
          and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg332"></a> human reïncarnation.
          For what else can this mean? <span class="tei tei-q">“The Wayfarer
          who crosses millions of years is the name of one, and the Great
          Green [Primordial Water or Chaos] the name of the other,”</span>
          one begetting millions of years in succession, the other engulfing
          them, to restore them back. (5) He speaks of the Seven Luminous
          Ones who follow their Lord, Osiris, who confers justice, in
          Amenti.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this is now
          shown to have been the source and origin of Christian dogmas. That
          which the Jews had from Egypt, through Moses and other Initiates,
          was confused and distorted enough in later days; but that which the
          Church got from both, is still more misinterpreted.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet the system
          of the former, in this special department of symbology—the key,
          namely, to the mysteries of astronomy as connected with those of
          generation and conception—is now proven identical with those ideas
          in ancient religions which have developed the phallic element of
          theology. The Jewish system of sacred measures, applied to
          religious symbols, is the same, so far as geometrical and numerical
          combinations go, as those of Greece, Chaldæa and Egypt, for it was
          adopted by the Israelites during the centuries of their slavery and
          captivity among the two latter nations.<a href="#note_458" id="noteref_458" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> What
          was this system? It is the intimate conviction of the author of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Source of Measures</span></span> that: <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Mosaic Books were intended, by a mode of art-speech, to set forth a
          geometrical and numerical system of exact science, which should
          serve as an origin of measures.”</span> Piazzi Smyth believes
          similarly. This system and these measures are found by some
          scholars to be identical with those used in the construction of the
          Great Pyramid: but this is only partially so. <span class="tei tei-q">“The foundation of these measures was the Parker
          ratio,”</span> says Ralston Skinner, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Source of
          Measures</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author of
          this very extraordinary work has discovered it, he says, in the use
          of the integral ratio of the diameter to the circumference of a
          circle, discovered by John A. Parker, of New York. This ratio is
          6561 for diameter, and 20612 for circumference. Furthermore, that
          this geometrical ratio was the very ancient and probably the divine
          origin of what have now become, through exoteric handling
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg333"></a> and practical

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But let us see
          what is said by the opponents of Prof. Piazzi Smyth's measurements
          of the Pyramid.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Petrie seems
          to deny them, and to have made short work altogether of Piazzi
          Smyth's calculations in their Biblical connection. So does Mr.
          Proctor, the champion <span class="tei tei-q">“Coincidentalist”</span> for many years past in every
          question of ancient arts and sciences. Speaking of <span class="tei tei-q">“the multitude of relations independent of the Pyramid,
          which have turned up while the Pyramidalists have been endeavouring
          to connect the Pyramid with the solar system,”</span> he says:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They had it
          assuredly; and it is on this <span class="tei tei-q">“knowledge”</span> that the programme of the Mysteries
          and of the series of Initiations was based: hence, the construction
          of the Pyramid, the everlasting record and the indestructible
          symbol of these Mysteries and Initiations on Earth, as the courses
          of the stars are in Heaven. The cycle of Initiation was a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg334"></a> reproduction in
          miniature of that great series of cosmic changes to which
          astronomers have given the name of the Tropical or Sidereal Year.
          Just as, at the close of the cycle of the Sidereal Year (25,868
          years), the heavenly bodies return to the same relative positions
          as they occupied at its outset, so at the close of the cycle of
          Initiation the Inner Man has regained the pristine state of divine
          purity and knowledge from which he set out on his cycle of
          terrestrial incarnation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moses, an
          Initiate into the Egyptian Mystagogy, based the religious mysteries
          of the new nation which he created, upon the same abstract formulæ
          derived from this Sidereal Cycle, symbolized by the form and
          measurements of the Tabernacle, which he is supposed to have
          constructed in the Wilderness. On these data, the later Jewish High
          Priests constructed the allegory of Solomon's Temple—a building
          which never had a real existence, any more than had King Solomon
          himself, who is as much a solar myth as is the still later Hiram
          Abif of the Masons, as Ragon has well demonstrated. Thus, if the
          measurements of this allegorical Temple, the symbol of the cycle of
          Initiation, coincide with those of the Great Pyramid, it is due to
          the fact that the former were derived from the latter through the
          Tabernacle of Moses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That our author
          has undeniably discovered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> and even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">keys</span></em>, is fully demonstrated in the
          work just quoted. One has only to read it, to feel a growing
          conviction that the hidden meaning of the allegories and parables
          of both <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testaments</span></span> is now unveiled. But
          that he owes this discovery far more to his own genius than to
          Parker and Piazzi Smyth, is also as certain, if not more so. For,
          as just shown, it is not so certain whether the measures of the
          Great Pyramid adopted by the Biblical Pyramidalists are beyond
          suspicion. A proof of this is to be found in the work called
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The
          Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh</span></span>, by Mr. F. Petrie, and
          also in other works written quite recently to oppose the said
          calculations, which their authors call <span class="tei tei-q">“biassed.”</span> We gather that nearly every one of
          Piazzi Smyth's measurements differs from the later and more
          carefully made measurements of Mr. Petrie, who concludes the
          Introduction to his work with this sentence:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">As to the results of the whole investigation,
          perhaps many theorists will agree with an American who was a warm
          believer in Pyramid theories when he came to Gizeh. I had the
          pleasure of his company there for a couple of days, and at our last
          meal together he said to me in a saddened way:</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Well, sir!
            I feel as if I had been to a funeral. By all means let the old
            theories have a decent burial, though we should take care that in
            our haste none of the wounded ones are buried
            alive.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the
          late J. A. Parker's calculation in general, and his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg335"></a> third proposition especially, we have
          consulted some eminent mathematicians, and this is the substance of
          what they say:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Parker's
          reasoning rests on sentimental, rather than on mathematical,
          considerations, and is logically inconclusive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Proposition III,
          namely, that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The circle is the natural basis or beginning of
          all area, and the square being made so in mathematical science, is
          artificial and arbitrary.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">—is an
          illustration of an arbitrary proposition, and cannot safely be
          relied upon in mathematical reasoning. The same observation
          applies, even more strongly, to Proposition VII, which states
          that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Because the circle is the primary shape in nature,
          and hence the basis of area; and because the circle is measured by,
          and is equal to the square only in ratio of half its circumference
          by the radius, therefore, circumference and radius, and not the
          square of diameter, are the only natural and legitimate elements of
          area, by which all regular shapes are made equal to the square, and
          equal to the circle.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Proposition IX
          is a remarkable example of faulty reasoning, though it is the one
          on which Mr. Parker's Quadrature mainly rests. It states that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The circle and the equilateral triangle are
          opposite to one another in all the elements of their construction,
          and hence the fractional diameter of one circle, which is equal to
          the diameter of one square, is in the opposite duplicate ratio to
          the diameter of an equilateral triangle whose area is one, etc.,
          etc.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Granting, for
          the sake of argument, that a triangle can be said to have a radius,
          in the sense in which we speak of the radius of a circle—for what
          Parker calls the radius of the triangle, is the radius of a circle
          inscribed in a triangle, and therefore not the radius of the
          triangle at all—and granting for the moment the other fanciful and
          mathematical propositions united in his premisses, why must we
          conclude that, if the equilateral triangle and circle are opposite
          in all the elements of their construction, the diameter of any
          defined circle is in the opposite duplicate ratio of the diameter
          of any given equivalent triangle? What necessary connection is
          there between the premisses and the conclusion? The reasoning is of
          a kind not known in geometry, and would not be accepted by strict
          mathematicians.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
          archaic Esoteric system originated the British inch or not, is of
          little consequence, however, to the strict and true metaphysician.
          Nor does Mr. Ralston Skinner's esoteric reading of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
          become incorrect, merely because the measurements of the Pyramid
          may not be found to agree with those of Solomon's Temple, the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page336">[pg 336]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg336"></a> Ark of Noah, etc.,
          or because Mr. Parker's Quadrature of the Circle is rejected by
          mathematicians. For Mr. Skinner's reading depends primarily on the
          Kabalistic methods and the Rabbinical value of the Hebrew letters.
          But it is extremely important to ascertain whether the measures
          used in the evolution of the symbolic religion of the Âryans, in
          the construction of their temples, in the figures given in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, and especially in their
          chronology, their astronomical symbols, the duration of the cycles,
          and other computations, were, or were not, the same as those used
          in the Biblical measurements and glyphs. For this will prove that
          the Jews, unless they took their sacred cubit and measurements from
          the Egyptians—Moses being an Initiate of their Priests—must have
          got those notions from India. At any rate they passed them on to
          the early Christians. Hence, it is the Occultists and Kabalists who
          are the true heirs to the Knowledge, or the Secret Wisdom, which is
          still found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>; for they alone now
          understand its real meaning, whereas profane Jews and Christians
          cling to the husks and dead letter thereof. That it was this system
          of measures which led to the invention of the God-names Elohim and
          Jehovah, and to their adaptation to Phallicism, and that Jehovah is
          a not very flattering copy of Osiris, is now demonstrated by the
          author of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Source of Measures</span></span>. But the
          latter and Mr. Piazzi Smyth both seem to labour under the
          impression that (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the priority of the system
          belongs to the Israelites, the Hebrew language being the divine
          language, and that (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) this universal language
          belongs to direct revelation!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter
          hypothesis is correct only in the sense shown in the last paragraph
          of the preceding Section; but we have yet to agree as to the nature
          and character of the divine <span class="tei tei-q">“Revealer.”</span> The former hypothesis as to priority
          will for the profane, of course depend on (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the
          internal and external evidence of the revelation, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) on
          each scholar's individual preconceptions. This, however, cannot
          prevent either the Theistic Kabalist, or the Pantheistic Occultist,
          from believing each in his way; neither of the two convincing the
          other. The data furnished by history are too meagre and
          unsatisfactory for either of them to prove to the sceptic which of
          them is right.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, the proofs afforded by tradition are too constantly rejected
          for us to hope to settle the question in our present age.
          Meanwhile, Materialistic Science will be laughing at both Kabalists
          and Occultists indifferently. But the vexed question of priority
          once laid <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page337">[pg
          337]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg337"></a>
          aside, Science, in its departments of Philology and Comparative
          Religion, will find itself finally taken to task, and be compelled
          to admit the common claim.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One by one the
          claims become admitted, as one Scientist after another is compelled
          to recognize the facts given out from the Secret Doctrine; though
          he rarely, if ever, recognizes that he has been anticipated in his
          statements. Thus, in the palmy days of Mr. Piazzi Smyth's authority
          on the Pyramid of Gizeh, his theory was, that the porphyry
          sarcophagus of the King's Chamber was <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the unit of measure</span></em> for the two
          most enlightened nations of the earth, England and America,”</span>
          and was no better than a <span class="tei tei-q">“corn-bin.”</span>
          This was vehemently denied by us in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span>, which had just been published at that time.
          Then the New York press arose in arms (the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sun</span></span> and
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">World</span></span> newspapers chiefly)
          against our presuming to correct or find fault with such a star of
          learning. In that work, we had said, that Herodotus, when treating
          of that Pyramid:</p>

          English writer who had maintained that the sarcophagus had been
          used for the celebration of the Mysteries of Osiris, although we
          had never heard of that writer. And now, six or seven years later
          (1882), this is what Mr. Staniland Wake writes:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Had Mr.
          Staniland Wake been a Theosophist, he might have added that the
          narrow upward passage leading to the King's Chamber had a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“narrow gate”</span> indeed; the same
          <span class="tei tei-q">“strait gate”</span> which <span class="tei tei-q">“leadeth unto <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg

          that it was of this gate in the Initiation Temple, that the writer,
          who recorded the words alleged to have been spoken by an Initiate,
          was thinking.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          greatest scholars of Science, instead of pooh-poohing that supposed
          <span class="tei tei-q">“farrago of absurd fiction and
          superstitions,”</span> as the Brâhmanical literature is generally
          termed, will endeavour to learn the symbolical universal language,
          with its numerical and geometrical keys. But here, again, they will
          hardly be successful, if they share the belief that the Jewish
          Kabalistic system contains the key to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em>
          mystery; for it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not</span></em>. Nor does any other
          Scripture at present possess it in its entirety, since even the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> are not complete. Every
          old religion is but a chapter or two of the entire volume of
          archaic primeval mysteries; Eastern Occultism alone being able to
          boast that it is in possession of the full secret, with its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em> keys. Comparisons will be
          instituted, and as much as possible will be explained in this work;
          the rest is left to the student's personal intuition. In saying
          that Eastern Occultism has the secret, it is not as if a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“complete”</span> or even an approximate
          knowledge was claimed by the writer, which would be absurd. What I
          know, I give out; that which I cannot explain, the student must
          find out for himself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But though we
          may suppose that the entire cycle of the universal Mystery Language
          will not be mastered for centuries to come, yet even the little
          which has hitherto been discovered in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
          by some scholars, is quite sufficient to demonstrate the
          claim—mathematically. As Judaism availed itself of two keys out of
          the seven, and as these two keys have now been re-discovered, it
          becomes no longer a matter of individual speculation and
          hypothesis, least of all of <span class="tei tei-q">“coincidence,”</span> but one of a correct reading of
          the Biblical texts, just as anyone acquainted with arithmetic reads
          and verifies an addition sum. In fact, all we have said in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span> is now found corroborated in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Egyptian
          Mystery</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Source of Measures</span></span>, by such
          readings of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> with the numerical and
          geometrical keys.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few years
          longer, and this system will kill the dead-letter reading of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, as it will that of all
          the other exoteric faiths, by showing the dogmas in their real,
          naked meaning. And then this undeniable meaning, however
          incomplete, will unveil the mystery of Being, and will, moreover,
          entirely change the modern scientific systems of Anthropology,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg339"></a> Ethnology and
          especially that of Chronology. The element of Phallicism, found in
          every God-name and narrative in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old</span></span>,
          and to some degree in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testament</span></span>, may also in time
          considerably change modern materialistic views on Biology and
          Physiology.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Divested of
          their modern repulsive crudeness, such views of Nature and man
          will, on the authority of the celestial bodies and their mysteries,
          unveil the evolutions of the human mind and show how natural was
          such a course of thought. The so-called phallic symbols have become
          offensive only because of the element of materiality and animality
          in them. In the beginning, such symbols were but natural, as they
          originated with the archaic races, which, issuing to their personal
          knowledge from an androgyne ancestry, were the first phenomenal
          manifestations in their own sight of the separation of the sexes
          and the ensuing mystery of creating in their turn. If later races,
          especially the <span class="tei tei-q">“chosen people,”</span> have
          degraded them, this does not affect the origin of the symbols. This
          little Semitic tribe—one of the smallest branchlets from the
          commingling of the fourth and fifth sub-races, the Mongolo-Turanian
          and the so-called Indo-European, after the sinking of the great
          Continent—could only accept its symbology in the spirit which was
          given to it by the nations from which it was derived. And,
          perchance, in the Mosaic beginnings, the symbology was not so crude
          as it became later under the handling of Ezra, who remodelled the
          whole <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>. To take an instance,
          the glyph of Pharaoh's daughter (the woman), the Nile (the Great
          Deep and Water), and the baby-boy found floating therein in the ark
          of rushes, was not primarily composed for, or by, Moses. It was
          anticipated in the fragments found on the Babylonian tiles, in the
          story of King Sargon, who lived far earlier than Moses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his

          Another strange <span class="tei tei-q">“coincidence”</span> is
          found in the fact that the name of the neighbouring City of Sippara

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. G. Smith
          then continues:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The story is supposed to have happened about
          1600</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
            rather earlier than the supposed age of Moses; and, as we know
            that the fame of Sargon reached Egypt, it is quite likely that
            this account had a connection with the events related in</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Exodus</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">II,
            for every action, when once performed, has a tendency to be
            repeated.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But now that
          Professor Sayce has had the courage to push back the dates of the
          Chaldean and Assyrian Kings by two thousand years more, Sargon must
          have preceded Moses by 2,000 years at the least. The confession is
          suggestive, but the figures lack a cypher or two.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, what is the
          logical inference? Most assuredly, that which gives us the right to
          say that the story told of Moses by Ezra had been learned by him
          while at Babylon, and that he applied the allegory told of Sargon
          to the Jewish lawgiver. In short, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodus</span></span>
          was never written by Moses, but was re-fabricated from old
          materials by Ezra.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And if so, then
          why should not other symbols and glyphs far more crude in their
          phallic element have been added by this adept in the later Chaldean
          and Sabæan phallic worship? We are taught that the primeval faith
          of the Israelites was quite different from that which was developed
          centuries later by the Talmudists, and before them by David and
          Hezekiah.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this,
          notwithstanding the exoteric element, as now found in the two
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testaments</span></span>, is quite sufficient
          to class the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> among esoteric
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg341"></a> works, and to
          connect its secret system with Indian, Chaldean, and Egyptian
          symbolism. The whole cycle of Biblical glyphs and numbers, as
          suggested by astronomical observations—Astronomy and Theology being
          closely connected—is found in Indian exoteric, as well as esoteric,
          systems. These figures and their symbols, the signs of the Zodiac,
          the planets, their aspects and nodes—the last term having now
          passed even into our modern Botany—are known in Astronomy as
          Sextiles, Quartiles and so on, and have been used for ages and æons
          by the archaic nations, and in one sense have the same meaning as
          the Hebrew numerals. The earliest forms of elementary geometry must
          have certainly been suggested by the observation of the heavenly
          bodies and their groupings. Hence, the most archaic symbols in
          Eastern Esotericism are a circle, a point, a triangle, a square, a
          pentagon, and a hexagon, and other plane figures with various sides
          and angles. This shows the knowledge and use of geometrical
          symbology to be as old as the world.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Starting from
          this, it becomes easy to understand how Nature herself, even
          without the help of their divine instructors, could have taught
          primeval mankind the first principles of a numerical and
          geometrical symbol-language.<a href="#note_471" id="noteref_471" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">471</span></span></a> Hence
          we find numbers and figures used as an expression and a record of
          thought in every archaic symbolical Scripture. They are ever the
          same, with certain variations only, arising from the first figures.
          Thus the evolution and correlation of the mysteries of Kosmos, of
          its growth and development—spiritual and physical, abstract and
          concrete—were first recorded in geometrical changes of shape. Every
          Cosmogony began with a circle, a point, a triangle and a square, up
          to number 9, when it was synthesized by the first line and a
          circle—the Pythagorean mystic Decad, the sum of all, involving and
          expressing the mysteries of the entire Kosmos; mysteries recorded a
          hundred times more fully in the Hindû system than elsewhere, for
          him who can understand its mystic language. The numbers 3 and 4, in
          their combination 7, and also 5, 6, 9, and 10, are the very
          corner-stones of Occult Cosmogonies. This Decad and its thousand
          combinations are found in every portion of the globe. One
          recognizes it in the caves and rock-cut temples of Hindûstan and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page342">[pg 342]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg342"></a> Central Asia; in the
          Pyramids and Lithoi of Egypt and America; in the Catacombs of
          Ozimandyas; in the mounds of the snow-capped Caucasian fastnesses;
          in the ruins of Palenque; in Easter Island; everywhere whither the
          foot of ancient man has ever journeyed. The 3 and the 4, the
          triangle and the square, or the universal male and female glyphs,
          showing the first aspect of the evolving deity, are stamped for
          ever in the Southern Cross in the Heavens, as in the Egyptian Crux

          Science, just as much as the Satanic and pre-Adamic Races, yet if
          the Scientists, having no other way out of their difficulties, are
          compelled to choose between the two, we feel certain that—Scripture
          notwithstanding—once the Mystery Language is approximately
          mastered, it is the archaic teaching that will be accepted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ether—this
          hypothetical Proteus, one of the <span class="tei tei-q">“representative fictions”</span> of Modern Science,
          which, nevertheless, was so long accepted—is one of the lower
          <span class="tei tei-q">“principles”</span> of what we call
          Primordial Substance (Âkâsha, in Sanskrit), one of the dreams of
          old, which has now again become the dream of Modern Science. It is
          the greatest, as it is the boldest, of the surviving speculations
          of ancient philosophers. For the Occultists, however, both Ether
          and the Primordial Substance are realities. To put it plainly,
          Ether is the Astral Light, and the Primordial Substance is Âkâsha,
          the Upâdhi of Divine Thought.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In modern
          language, the latter would be better named Cosmic Ideation, Spirit;
          the former, Cosmic Substance, Matter. These, the Alpha and the
          Omega of Being, are but the two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facets</span></em>
          of the one Absolute Existence. The latter was never addressed, or
          even mentioned, by any name in antiquity, except in allegory. In
          the oldest Âryan race, the Hindû, the worship of the intellectual
          classes at no time ever consisted in an adoration of marvellous
          form and art, however fervent, as with the Greeks; an adoration,
          which led later on to anthropomorphism. But while the Greek
          philosopher adored form, and the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg348"></a> Hindû sage alone <span class="tei tei-q">“perceived the true relation of earthly beauty and
          eternal truth”</span>—the uneducated of every nation understood
          neither, at any time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They do not
          understand it even now. The evolution of the God-idea proceeds
          apace with man's own intellectual evolution. So true is it that the
          noblest ideal to which the religious spirit of one age can soar,
          will appear but a gross caricature to the philosophic mind in a
          succeeding epoch! The philosophers themselves had to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">initiated into
          perceptive mysteries</span></em>, before they could grasp the
          correct idea of the Ancients in relation to this most metaphysical
          subject. Otherwise—outside such Initiation—for every thinker there
          will be a <span class="tei tei-q">“thus far shalt thou go and no
          farther”</span> mapped out by his intellectual capacity, as clearly
          and as unmistakably as there is one for the progress of any nation
          or race in its cycle by the law of Karma. Outside of Initiation,
          the ideals of contemporary religious thought must always have their
          wings clipped, and remain unable to soar higher; for idealistic, as
          well as realistic, thinkers, and even free-thinkers, are but the
          outcome and the natural product of their respective environments
          and periods. The ideals of each are but the necessary results of
          their temperaments, and the outcome of that phase of intellectual
          progress to which a nation, in its collectivity, has attained.
          Hence, as already remarked, the highest flights of modern Western
          metaphysics have fallen far short of the truth. Much of current
          Agnostic speculation on the existence of the <span class="tei tei-q">“First Cause”</span> is little better than veiled
          Materialism—the terminology alone being different. Even so great a
          thinker as Mr. Herbert Spencer speaks of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable”</span> occasionally in terms that
          demonstrate the lethal influence of materialistic thought, which,
          like the deadly Sirocco, has withered and blighted all current
          ontological speculation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For instance,
          when he terms the <span class="tei tei-q">“First Cause”</span> the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“power <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifesting</span></em> through

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">energy</span></em>,”</span> it is clear that
          he has grasped solely the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> aspect of the Mystery of
          Being—the Energies of Cosmic Substance only. The coeternal aspect
          of the One Reality, Cosmic Ideation, is absolutely omitted from
          consideration, and as to its Noumenon, it seems non-existent in the
          mind of the great thinker. Without doubt, this one-sided mode of
          dealing with the problem is due largely to the pernicious Western
          practice of subordinating Consciousness to Matter, or regarding it
          as a <span class="tei tei-q">“bye-product”</span> of molecular
          motion.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page349">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the early
          ages of the Fourth Race, when Spirit alone was worshipped and the
          Mystery was made manifest, down to the last palmy days of Grecian
          art, at the dawn of Christianity, the Hellenes alone had dared
          publicly to raise an altar to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknown
          God.”</span> Whatever St. Paul may have had in his profound mind,
          when declaring to the Athenians that this <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknown,”</span> which they ignorantly worshipped, was
          the true God announced by himself—that Deity <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was not</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah,”</span> nor was he <span class="tei tei-q">“the maker of the world and all things.”</span> For it
          is not the <span class="tei tei-q">“God of Israel”</span> but the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknown”</span> of the ancient and modern
          Pantheist that <span class="tei tei-q">“dwelleth not in temples

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Divine Thought
          cannot be defined, nor can its meaning be explained, except by the
          numberless manifestations of Cosmic Substance, in which the former
          is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensed</span></em> spiritually by those who
          can do so. To say this, after having defined it as the Unknown
          Deity, abstract, impersonal, sexless, which must be placed at the
          root of every Cosmogony and its subsequent evolution, is equivalent
          to saying nothing at all. It is like attempting a transcendental
          equation of conditions, having in hand for deducing the true value
          of its terms only a number of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unknown</span></em> quantities. Its place is
          found in the old primitive symbolic charts, in which, as already
          shown, it is represented by a boundless darkness, on the ground of
          which appears the first central point in white—thus symbolizing
          coëval and coëternal Spirit-Matter making its appearance in the
          phenomenal world, before its first differentiation. When
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the One becomes Two,”</span> it may then
          be referred to as Spirit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></em> Matter. To <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit”</span> is referable every manifestation of
          Consciousness, reflective or direct, and of <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious purposiveness”</span>—to adopt a modern
          expression used in Western <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophy</span></em>, so-called—as evidenced
          in the Vital Principle, and Nature's submission to the majestic
          sequence of immutable Law. <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter”</span>
          must be regarded as objectivity in its purest abstraction, the
          self-existing basis, whose septenary manvantaric differentiations
          constitute the objective reality underlying the phenomena of each
          phase of conscious existence. During the period of Universal
          Pralaya, Cosmic Ideation is non-existent; and the variously
          differentiated states of Cosmic Substance are resolved back again
          into the primary state of abstract potential objectivity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Manvantaric
          impulse commences with the reäwakening of Cosmic Ideation, the
          Universal Mind, concurrently with, and parallel to, the primary
          emergence of Cosmic Substance—the latter being the manvantaric
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg350"></a> vehicle of the
          former—from its undifferentiated pralayic state. Then, Absolute
          Wisdom mirrors itself in its Ideation; which, by a transcendental
          process, superior to and incomprehensible by human Consciousness,
          results in Cosmic Energy, Fohat. Thrilling through the bosom of
          inert Substance, Fohat impels it to activity, and guides its
          primary differentiations on all the seven planes of Cosmic
          Consciousness. There are thus Seven Protyles—as they are now
          called, whereas Âryan antiquity named them the Seven Prakritis, or
          Natures—serving, severally, as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">relatively</span></em> homogeneous bases,
          which in the course of the increasing heterogeneity, in the
          evolution of the Universe, differentiate into the marvellous
          complexity presented by phenomena on the planes of perception. The
          term <span class="tei tei-q">“relatively”</span> is used
          designedly, because the very existence of such a process, resulting
          in the primary segregations of undifferentiated Cosmic Substance
          into its septenary bases of evolution, compels us to regard the
          Protyle of each plane as only a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mediate</span></em>
          phase assumed by Substance in its passage from abstract, into full
          objectivity. The term Protyle is due to Mr. Crookes, the eminent
          Chemist, who has given that name to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pre-matter</span></em>, if one may so call
          primordial and purely homogeneous substance, suspected, if not
          actually yet found, by Science in the ultimate composition of the
          atom. But the incipient segregation of primordial matter into atoms
          and molecules takes its rise subsequent to the evolution of our
          Seven Protyles. It is the last of these that Mr. Crookes is in
          search of, having recently detected the possibility of its
          existence on our plane.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cosmic Ideation
          is said to be non-existent during pralayic periods, for the simple
          reason that there is no one, and nothing, to perceive its effects.
          There can be no manifestation of consciousness, semi-consciousness,
          or even <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious purposiveness,”</span>
          except through a vehicle of Matter; that is to say, on this our
          plane, wherein human consciousness, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in its normal
          state</span></em>, cannot soar beyond what is known as
          transcendental metaphysics, it is only through some molecular
          aggregation, or fabric, that Spirit wells up in a stream of
          individual or sub-conscious subjectivity. And as Matter existing
          apart from perception is a mere abstraction, both of these aspects
          of the Absolute—Cosmic Substance and Cosmic Ideation—are mutually
          interdependent. In strict accuracy, to avoid confusion and
          misconception, the term <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter”</span>
          ought to be applied to the aggregate of objects of possible
          perception, and the term <span class="tei tei-q">“Substance”</span>
          to Noumena; for inasmuch as the phenomena of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em>
          plane are the creations of the perceiving Ego—the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg351"></a> modifications of its own
          subjectivity—all the <span class="tei tei-q">“states of matter
          representing the aggregate of perceived objects”</span> can have
          but a relative and purely phenomenal existence for the children of
          our plane. As the modern Idealists would say, the coöperation of
          Subject and Object results in the sense-object, or phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this does
          not necessarily lead to the conclusion that it is the same on all
          other planes; that the coöperation of the two, on the planes of
          their septenary differentiation, results in a septenary aggregate
          of phenomena which are likewise non-existent <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
          se</span></span>, though concrete realities for the Entities of
          whose experience they form a part, in the same manner as the rocks
          and rivers around us are real from the stand-point of a Physicist,
          though unreal illusions of sense from that of the Metaphysician. It
          would be an error to say, or even conceive, such a thing. From the
          stand-point of the highest metaphysics, the whole Universe, Gods
          included, is an Illusion (Mâyâ). But the illusion of him who is in
          himself an illusion differs on every plane of consciousness; and we
          have no more right to dogmatize about the possible nature of the
          perceptive faculties of an Ego on, say, the sixth plane, than we
          have to identify our perceptions with, or make them a standard for,
          those of an ant, in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">its</span></em> mode of consciousness. Cosmic
          Ideation focussed in a Principle, or Upâdhi (Basis), results as the
          consciousness of the individual Ego. Its manifestation varies with
          the degree of the Upâdhi. For instance, through that known as
          Manas, it wells up as Mind-Consciousness; through the more finely
          differentiated fabric (sixth state of matter) of Buddhi—resting on
          the experience of Manas as its Basis—as a stream of Spiritual
          Intuition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pure Object
          apart from consciousness is unknown to us, while living on the
          plane of our three-dimensional world, for we know only the mental
          states it excites in the perceiving Ego. And, so long as the
          contrast of Subject and Object endures—to wit, so long as we enjoy
          our five senses and no more, and do not know how to divorce our
          all-perceiving Ego from the thraldom of these senses—so long will
          it be impossible for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> Ego to break through the
          barrier which separates it from a knowledge of <span class="tei tei-q">“things in themselves,”</span> or Substance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That Ego,
          progressing in an arc of ascending subjectivity, must exhaust the
          experience of every plane. But not till the Unit is merged in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>, whether on this or
          any other plane, and Subject and Object alike vanish in the
          absolute negation of the Nirvânic State—negation, again, only
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from our
          plane</span></em>—not until then, is scaled that peak of

          the Knowledge of Things-in-themselves, and the solution of the yet
          more awful riddle approached, before which even the highest Dhyân
          Chohan must bow in silence and ignorance—the Unspeakable Mystery of
          that which is called by the Vedântins, Parabrahman.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, such
          being the case, all those who have sought to give a name to the
          Incognizable Principle have simply degraded it. Even to speak of
          Cosmic Ideation—save in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phenomenal</span></em> aspect—is like trying
          to bottle up primordial Chaos, or to put a printed label on
          Eternity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, then, is
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Primordial Substance,”</span> that
          mysterious object of which Alchemy was ever talking, and which was
          the subject of philosophical speculation in every age? What can it

          Even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is the All of manifested

          look at it without seeing it; we breathe it and do not perceive it;
          we hear and smell it without the smallest cognition that it is
          there; for it is in every molecule of that which, in our illusion
          and ignorance, we regard as Matter in any of its states, or
          conceive as a feeling, a thought, an emotion. In short, it is the
          Upâdhi, or Vehicle, of every possible phenomenon, whether physical,
          mental, or psychic. In the opening sentences of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, and in the Chaldean
          Cosmogony; in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> of India, and in the

          Æther,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Magnus Æther,”</span>
          in its collective aggregate. The septenary gradation, and the
          innumerable sub-divisions and differences, made by the Ancients
          between the powers of Ether collectively—from its outward fringe of
          effects, with which our Science is so familiar, up to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Imponderable Substance,”</span> once
          admitted as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ether of Space,”</span>
          but now about to be rejected—have been ever a vexing riddle for
          every branch of knowledge. The Mythologists and Symbologists of our
          day, confused by this incomprehensible glorification on the one
          hand, and degradation on the other, of the same deified Entity and
          in the same religious systems, are often driven to the most
          ludicrous mistakes. The Church, firm as a rock in each and all of
          her early errors of interpretation, has made of Ether the abode of
          her Satanic legions. The whole Hierarchy of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fallen”</span> Angels is there; Cosmocratores, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“World Bearers,”</span> according to
          Bossuet; Mundi Tenentes, the <span class="tei tei-q">“World
          Holders,”</span> as Tertullian calls them; Mundi Domini,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“World Dominations,”</span> or rather
          Dominators; the Curbati, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Curved,”</span> etc.; thus making of the stars and
          celestial orbs in their courses—Devils!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For it is thus
          that the Church has interpreted the verse: <span class="tei tei-q">“For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
          against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the
          darkness of this world.”</span><a href="#note_482" id="noteref_482" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">482</span></span></a>
          Further, St. Paul mentions the spiritual malices (<span class="tei tei-q">“wickedness,”</span> in English texts), in the
          Air—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritualia nequitiæ
          cœlestibus</span></span>—the Latin texts giving various names to
          these <span class="tei tei-q">“malices,”</span> the innocent
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Elementals.”</span> But the Church is
          right this time, though wrong in calling them all Devils. The
          Astral Light, or lower Ether, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> full of conscious,
          semi-conscious and unconscious entities; only the church has less
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">power</span></em> over them than over
          invisible microbes or mosquitoes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difference
          made between the seven states of Ether—itself one of the Seven
          Cosmic Principles, whereas the Æther of the ancients is Universal
          Fire—may be seen in the injunctions by Zoroaster and Psellus,
          respectively. The former said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Consult it
          only when it is without form or figure”</span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">absque formâ et
          figurâ</span></span>—which means, without flames or burning coals.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“When it has a form, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heed it
          not</span></em>”</span>; teaches Psellus, <span class="tei tei-q">“but when it is formless, obey it, for it is then
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sacred
          fire</span></em>, and all it will reveal thee shall be
          true.”</span><a href="#note_483" id="noteref_483" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">483</span></span></a> This
          proves that Ether, itself an aspect of Âkâsha, has in its turn
          several aspects or <span class="tei tei-q">“principles.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the ancient
          nations deified Æther in its imponderable aspect and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg354"></a> potency. Virgil calls Jupiter,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pater
          Omnipotens Æther</span></span>, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Æther.”</span><a href="#note_484" id="noteref_484" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a> The
          Hindûs have also placed it among their deities, under the name of
          Âkâsha, the synthesis of Ether. And the author of the Homœomerian
          System of philosophy, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, firmly believed that
          the spiritual prototypes of all things, as well as their elements,
          were to be found in the boundless Æther, where they were generated,
          whence they evolved, and whither they returned—an Occult
          teaching.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It thus becomes
          clear that it is from Æther, in its highest synthetic aspect, once
          anthropomorphized, that sprang the first idea of a personal
          Creative Deity. With the philosophical Hindûs the Elements are
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tâmasa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“unenlightened by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intellect</span></em>, which they
          obscure.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now to
          exhaust the question of the mystical meaning of Primordial Chaos
          and of the Root-Principle, and show how they were connected in the
          ancient philosophies with Âkâsha, incorrectly translated Ether, and
          also with Mâyâ, Illusion, of which Îshvara is the male aspect. We
          shall speak further on of the Intelligent Principle, or rather of
          the invisible immaterial properties, in the visible and material
          elements, that <span class="tei tei-q">“sprang from the Primordial
          Chaos.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For <span class="tei tei-q">“what is the primordial Chaos but Æther?”</span>—it is
          asked, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis Unveiled</span></span>. Not the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modern</span></em> Ether; not such as is
          recognized now, but such as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> known to the ancient
          philosophers long before the time of Moses—Æther, with all its
          mysterious and occult properties, containing in itself the germs of
          universal creation. The Upper Æther, or Âkâsha, is the Celestial
          Virgin and Mother of every existing form and being, from whose
          bosom, as soon as <span class="tei tei-q">“incubated”</span> by the
          Divine Spirit, are called into existence Matter and Life, Force and
          Action. Æther is the Aditi of the Hindûs, and it is Âkâsha.
          Electricity, magnetism, heat, light, and chemical action are so
          little understood even now, that fresh facts are constantly
          widening the range of our knowledge. Who knows where ends the power
          of this protean giant—Æther; or whence its mysterious origin? Who,
          we mean, that denies the Spirit that works in it, and evolves out
          of it all visible forms?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be an
          easy task to show that the cosmogonical legends all over the world
          are based on a knowledge among the Ancients of those sciences,
          which have, in our days, allied themselves in support of the
          doctrine of evolution; and that further research may demonstrate
          that these Ancients were far better acquainted with the fact of
          evolution <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg

          verse 14 to 36, evolution is given in the order described in the
          Esoteric Philosophy. This cannot be easily gainsaid. Even
          Medhâtithi, the son of Virasvâmin, and the author of the
          Commentary, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manubhâsya</span></span>, whose date,

          unwilling to give out more, because he knew what had to be kept
          from the profane, or else he was really puzzled. Still, what he
          does give out makes the septenary principle in man and Nature plain

          (Universal) Self-Consciousness, as Manas in the microcosm springs
          from Mahat, or Mahâ-Buddhi (Buddhi, in man). For Manas is dual. As

<span class="tei tei-q">“the rest”</span> here meaning that Manas,
          our Fifth Principle (the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fifth</span></em>, because the body was named

          with the lower Four Principles. Hence, our teaching: namely, that
          Manas follows Âtmâ-Buddhi to Devachan, and that the Lower Manas,
          that is to say, the dregs or residue of Manas, remains with Kâma

          beings.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, according
          to Medhâtithi, it ought to read <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mâtrâbhih</span></span> instead of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“He having pervaded the subtile parts of those six, of
          unmeasured brightness, by elements of self, created all

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter
          reading must be the correct one, since He, the Self, is what we
          call Âtmâ, and thus constitutes the seventh principle, the
          synthesis of the <span class="tei tei-q">“six.”</span> Such is also
          the opinion of the editor of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mânava Dharma
          Shâstra</span></span>, who seems to have intuitionally entered far
          deeper into the spirit of the philosophy than has the translator,
          the late Dr. Burnell; for he hesitates little between the text of
          Kullûka Bhatta and the commentary of Medhâtithi. Rejecting the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tanmâtra</span></span>, or subtile elements,
          and the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">âtmamâtra</span></span> of Kullûka Bhatta, he
          says, applying the principles to the Cosmic Self:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“The six appear rather to be the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">manas</span></span> plus the five principles
          of ether, air, fire, water, earth; <span class="tei tei-q">‘having
          united five portions of those six with the spiritual element [the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em>] he (thus) created all
          existing things;’</span> ... <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">âtmamâtra</span></span> is therefore the
          spiritual atom as opposed to the elementary, not reflexive
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘elements of himself’</span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus he corrects
          the translation of verse 17:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“As the subtile elements of bodily forms of this One
          depend on these six, so the wise call his form Sharîra.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And he adds that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“elements”</span> mean here portions, or
          parts (or principles), which reading is borne out by verse 19,
          which says:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“This non-eternal (Universe) arises then from the
          Eternal, by means of the subtile elements of forms of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">those
          seven</span></em> very glorious Principles (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purusha</span></span>).”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Commenting upon
          which emendation of Medhâtithi, the editor remarks: <span class="tei tei-q">“the five elements <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em>
          mind [<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Manas</span></span>] and self-consciousness
          [<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ahamkâra</span></span>]<a href="#note_489" id="noteref_489" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> are
          probably meant; <span class="tei tei-q">‘subtile elements,’</span>
          as before [meaning] <span class="tei tei-q">‘fine portions of
          form’</span> [or principles].”</span> Verse 20 shows this, when
          saying of these five elements, or <span class="tei tei-q">“fine
          portions of form”</span> (Rûpa <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em>
          Manas and Self-Consciousness) that they constitute the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Purusha,”</span> or Principles, called in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven Prakritis.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Moreover, these
          <span class="tei tei-q">“five elements,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“five portions,”</span> are spoken of in verse 27 as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“those which are called the atomic
          destructible portions,”</span> and which are, therefore,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“distinct from the atoms of the
          Nyâya.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This creative
          Brahmâ, issuing from the Mundane or Golden Egg, unites in himself
          both the male and female principles. He is, in short, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg358"></a> the same as all the creative
          Protologoi. Of Brahmâ, however, it could not be said, as of
          Dionysos, <span class="tei tei-q">“πρωτόγονον διφυῆ τρίγονον
          βακχεῖον Ἅνακτα Ἄγριον ἀρρητὸν κρύφιον δικέρωτα δίμορφον”</span>—a

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">symbol</span></em> in the ark—because no
          licentious Dionysia were ever established in his name and honour.
          All such public worship was exoteric, and the great universal
          symbols were distorted universally, as those of Krishna are now by
          the Vallabâchâryas of Bombay, the followers of the <span class="tei tei-q">“infant”</span> God. But are these popular Gods the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> Deity? Are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they</span></em>
          the apex and synthesis of the sevenfold creation, man included?
          Impossible! Each and all are one of the rungs of that septenary
          ladder of Divine Consciousness, Pagan as Christian. Ain Suph is
          said to manifest through the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Seven Letters</span></span> of the Name of
          Jehovah who, having usurped the place of the Unknown Limitless, was
          given by his devotees his Seven Angels of the Presence—his Seven
          Principles. But, indeed, they are mentioned in almost every school.
          In the pure Sânkhya philosophy Mahat, Ahamkâra and the five
          Tanmâtras are called the Seven Prakritis, or Natures, and are
          counted from Mahâ-Buddhi, or Mahat, down to Earth.<a href="#note_490" id="noteref_490" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Primordial Substance”</span> is called by
          some Chaos. Plato and the Pythagoreans named it the Soul of the
          World, after it had been impregnated by the Spirit of that which
          broods over the Primeval Waters, or Chaos. It is by being reflected
          in it, say the Kabalists, that the brooding Principle <span class="tei tei-q">“created”</span> the phantasmagoria of a visible,
          manifested Universe. Chaos before, Ether after this <span class="tei tei-q">“reflection,”</span> it is still the Deity that
          pervades Space and all things. It is the invisible, imponderable
          Spirit of things, and the invisible, but only too tangible, fluid
          that radiates from the fingers of the healthy magnetizer, for it is
          Vital Electricity—Life itself. Called in derision, by the Marquis

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the
          fragments of the cosmogonical systems that have reached us are now

          survived even the Great Flood that submerged the Antediluvian
          Giants and with them their very memory, save the record preserved
          in the Secret Doctrine, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> and other Scriptures—still

          them all. No one can seriously study ancient philosophies without
          perceiving that the striking similitude of conception in all of

          spirit invariably, is the result of no mere coincidence, but of a
          concurrent design; and that, during the youth of mankind, there was
          but one language, one knowledge, one universal religion, when there
          were no churches, no creeds or sects, but when every man was a
          priest unto himself. And, if it is shown that already in those
          early ages which are shut out from our sight by the exuberant
          growth of tradition, human religious thought developed in uniform
          sympathy in every portion of the globe; then, it becomes evident
          that that thought, born under whatever latitude, in the cold North
          or the burning South, in the East or West, was inspired by the same
          revelations, and that man was nurtured under the protecting shadow

          contained in itself all the Elements in their rudimentary,
          undifferentiated State. They made Æther, the fifth Element, the
          synthesis of the other four; for the Æther of the Greek
          philosophers was not its Dregs, although indeed they knew more than
          Science does now of these Dregs (Ether), which are rightly enough
          supposed to act as an agent for many Forces that manifest on Earth.
          Their Æther was the Âkâsha of the Hindûs; the Ether accepted in
          Physics is but one of its sub-divisions, on our plane, the Astral
          Light of the Kabalists with all its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evil</span></em> as
          well as its good effects.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Seeing that the
          Essence of Æther, or the Unseen Space, was considered divine, as
          being the supposed Veil of Deity, it was regarded as the Medium
          between this life and the next. The Ancients considered that when
          the directing active Intelligences—the Gods—retired from any
          portion of Æther in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> Space, or the four realms
          which they superintend, then that particular region was left in the
          possession of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evil</span></em>, so called by reason of the
          absence from it of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">good</span></em>.</p>

          that in Ether, the elements represent only Matter, the blind Cosmic
          Forces of Nature; while Spirit represents the Intelligence which
          directs them. The Âryan, Hermetic, Orphic, and Pythagorean
          cosmogonical doctrines, as well as those of Sanchuniathon and
          Berosus, are all based upon one irrefutable formula, viz., that
          Æther and Chaos, or, in the Platonic language, Mind and Matter,
          were the two primeval and eternal principles of the Universe,
          utterly independent of anything else. The former was the

          Democritus, with his instructor Leucippus, taught that the first
          principles of all things contained in the Universe were Atoms and a
          Vacuum. The latter means simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">latent</span></em>
          Force or Deity, which, before its first manifestation—when it
          became Will, communicating the first impulse to these Atoms—was the
          great Nothingness, Ain Suph, or No-Thing; and, therefore, to every
          sense, a Void, or Chaos.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Chaos,
          however, became the <span class="tei tei-q">“Soul of the

          to Hindû teaching, Deity, in the shape of Æther or Âkâsha, pervades
          all things. It was called, therefore, by the Theurgists the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Living Fire,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of Light,”</span> and sometimes <span class="tei tei-q">“Magnes.”</span> According to Plato, the highest Deity
          itself built the Universe in the geometrical form of the
          dodecahedron, and its <span class="tei tei-q">“First-Begotten”</span> was born of Chaos and
          Primordial Light—the Central Sun. This First-Born, however, was
          only the aggregate of the Host of the Builders, the first
          Constructive Forces, who are called in ancient Cosmogonies, the
          Ancients, born of the Deep or Chaos, and the First Point. He is the
          Tetragrammaton, so-called, at the head of the Seven lower
          Sephiroth. This was also the belief of the Chaldeans. Philo, the

          embracing all the Gods, or Theoi, came to the <span class="tei tei-q">“superior”</span> civilized nations from a strange
          source, one as entirely and preëminently phallic as the sincere
          outspokenness of the Indian Lingham. The attempt to derive
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">God</span></span> from the Anglo-Saxon synonym
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Good</span></span> is an abandoned idea, for
          in no other language, from the Persian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Khoda</span></span> down to the Latin
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Deus</span></span>, has an instance been found
          of the name for God being derived from the attribute of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Goodness</span></span>. To the Latin races it
          comes from the Âryan <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Dyaus</span></span> (the Day); to the
          Slavonian, from the Greek Bacchus (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bagh-bog</span></span>); and to the Saxon
          races directly from the Hebrew <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Yod</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Jod</span></span>. The latter is י the
          number-letter 10, male and female, and Yod is the phallic
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">hook</span></span>. Hence the Saxon
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Godh</span></span>, the Germanic <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Gott</span></span>, and the English

          said to represent the Creator of Physical Humanity, on the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">terrestrial</span></em> plane; but surely it
          had nothing to do with the Formation, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation,”</span> of either Spirit, Gods, or

          the Unknowable Deity. It can be known only in its active functions;
          hence as Matter-Force and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></em> Spirit, the correlations

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hindûs have
          an endless series of allegories to express this idea. In the
          Primordial Chaos, before it became developed into the Sapta
          Samudra, or Seven Oceans—emblematical of the Seven Gunas, or
          conditioned Qualities, composed of Trigunas (Sattva, Rajas and
          Tamas)—lie latent both Amrita, or Immortality, and Visha, or
          Poison, Death, Evil. This is to be found in the allegorical
          Churning of the Ocean by the Gods. Amrita is beyond any Guna, for
          it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unconditioned</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
          se</span></span>; but when once fallen into phenomenal creation, it
          became mixed with Evil, Chaos, with latent Theos in it, before
          Kosmos was evolved. Hence we find Vishnu, the personification of
          Eternal Law, periodically calling forth Kosmos into activity, or,
          in allegorical phraseology, churning out of the Primitive Ocean, or
          Boundless Chaos, the Amrita of Eternity, reserved only for the Gods
          and Devas; and in the task he has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg 372]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg372"></a> to employ Nâgas and Asuras, or Demons in
          exoteric Hindûism. The whole allegory is highly philosophical, and
          indeed we find it repeated in every ancient system of philosophy.
          Thus we find it in Plato, who having fully embraced the ideas which
          Pythagoras had brought from India, compiled and published them in a
          form more intelligible than the original mysterious numerals of the
          Samian Sage. Thus the Kosmos is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son”</span> with Plato, having for his Father and
          Mother Divine Thought and Matter.<a href="#note_524" id="noteref_524" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Logos, or
          Creative Deity, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Word made
          Flesh,”</span> of every religion, has to be traced to its ultimate
          source and essence. In India, it is a Proteus of 1,008 divine names
          and aspects in each of its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> transformations, from
          Brahmâ-Purusha, through the Seven <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Divine</span></em>
          Rishis and Ten <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Semi-divine</span></em> Prajâpatis (also
          Rishis), down to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Divine-human</span></em> Avatâras. The same
          puzzling problem of the <span class="tei tei-q">“One in
          Many,”</span> and the Multitude in One, is found in other
          Pantheons; in the Egyptian, the Greek and the Chaldeo-Judaic, the
          latter having made confusion still more confused by presenting its
          Gods as euhemerizations, in the shapes of Patriarchs. And these
          Patriarchs are now accepted by those who reject Romulus as a myth,
          and are represented as living and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em> Entities. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Verbum satis
          sapienti!</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, Ain Suph is also the One,
          the Infinite Unity. This was known to the very few learned Fathers
          of the Church, who were aware that Jehovah was no <span class="tei tei-q">“highest”</span> God, but a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third-rate</span></em> Potency. But while
          complaining bitterly of the Gnostics, and saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“our Heretics hold ... that Propatôr is known but to
          the Only-begotten Son<a href="#note_529" id="noteref_529" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a> [who
          is Brahmâ], that is to the Mind [Nous],”</span> Irenæus failed to
          mention that the Jews did the same in their real <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secret</span></em>
          books. Valentinus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the profoundest doctor
          of the Gnosis,”</span> held that <span class="tei tei-q">“there was
          a perfect Aiôn who existed before Bythos [the first Father of
          unfathomable nature, which is the Second Logos], called
          Propatôr.”</span> It is this Aiôn who springs as a Ray from Ain
          Suph, which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not create</span></em>, and Aiôn who
          creates, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em> whom, rather, everything
          is created, or evolves. For, as the Basilidians taught,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“there was a Supreme God, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page374">[pg 374]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg374"></a> Abrasax, by whom was created Mind
          [Mahat, in Sanskrit; Nous, in Greek]. From Mind proceeded the Word,
          Logos; from the Word, Providence [Divine Light, rather]; then from
          it Virtue and Wisdom in Principalities, Powers, Angels,
          etc.”</span> By these Angels the 365 Æons were created.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Amongst the lowest, indeed, and those who
          made this world, he [Basilides] sets last of all the God of the
          Jews, whom he denies to be God [and very rightly], affirming he is
          one of the Angels.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, then, we
          find the same system as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>,
          wherein the Incomprehensible drops a Seed, which becomes the Golden
          Egg, from which Brahmâ is produced. Brahmâ produces Mahat, etc.
          True Esoteric Philosophy, however, speaks neither of <span class="tei tei-q">“creation,”</span> nor of <span class="tei tei-q">“evolution,”</span> in the sense in which the exoteric
          religions do. All these personified Powers are not evolutions from
          one another, but so many aspects of the one and sole manifestation
          of the Absolute All.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same system
          as that of the Gnostic Emanations prevails in the Sephirothic
          aspects of Ain Suph, and, as these aspects are in Space and Time, a
          certain order is maintained in their successive appearances.
          Therefore, it becomes impossible not to take notice of the great
          changes that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span> has undergone under the
          handling of generations of Christian Mystics. For, even in the
          metaphysics of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmud</span></span>, the Lower Face or Lesser
          Countenance, or Microprosopus, could never be placed on the same
          plane of abstract ideals as the Higher, or Greater Countenance,
          Macroprosopus. The latter is, in the Chaldean <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>, a pure abstraction, the
          Word or Logos, or Dabar in Hebrew; which Word, though it becomes in
          fact a plural number, or Words, D(a)B(a)R(i)M, when it reflects
          itself, or falls into the aspect of a Host of Angels, or
          Sephiroth—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Number”</span>—is still
          collectively One, and on the ideal plane a nought, [circle],
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing.”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It</span></em> is
          without form or being, <span class="tei tei-q">“with no likeness
          with anything else.”</span><a href="#note_530" id="noteref_530" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a> And
          even Philo calls the Creator, the Logos who stands next God, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Second God,”</span> when he speaks of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Second God, who is his [the Highest
          God's] Wisdom.”</span><a href="#note_531" id="noteref_531" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> Deity
          is not God. It is No-thing, and Darkness. It is nameless, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor are most of
          the Gnostic systems which have come down to us, mutilated as they
          are by the Church Fathers, anything better than the distorted
          shells of the original speculations. Nor were they, moreover, ever
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">open</span></em> to the public or general
          reader; for had their hidden meaning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg375"></a> or esotericism been revealed, it would have
          been no more an esoteric teaching, and this could never have been.
          Marcus, the chief of the Marcosians, who flourished in the middle
          of the second century, and taught that Deity had to be viewed under
          the symbol of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> syllables, gave out more of
          the esoteric truths than any other Gnostic. But even he was never
          well understood. For it is only on the surface or dead-letter of
          his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revelation</span></span> that it appears that
          God is a Quaternary, to wit, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Ineffable, the Silence, the Father, and Truth,”</span> since in
          reality it is quite erroneous, and divulges only one more esoteric
          riddle. This teaching of Marcus was that of the early Kabalists and
          is ours. For he makes of Deity the Number 30, in four syllables,
          which, translated esoterically, means a Triad or Triangle, and a
          Quaternary or a Square, in all seven, which, on the lower plane,
          made the seven divine or Secret Letters of which the God-name is
          composed. This requires demonstration. In his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Revelation</span></span>, speaking of divine
          mysteries expressed by means of letters and numbers, Marcus
          narrates how the Supreme <span class="tei tei-q">“Tetrad came
          down”</span> unto him <span class="tei tei-q">“from the region
          which cannot be seen nor named, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in a female
          form</span></em>, because <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the world would have been unable to bear her
          appearing in a male figure</span></span>,”</span> and revealed to
          him <span class="tei tei-q">“the generation of the universe,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">untold
          before to either</span></em> Gods or men.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          sentence already contains a double meaning. Why should the
          apparition of a female figure be more easily borne, or listened to,
          by the world than a male figure? On the face of it, this appears
          nonsensical. But to one who is acquainted with the Mystery
          Language, it is quite clear and simple. Esoteric Philosophy, or the
          Secret Wisdom, was symbolized by a female form, while a male figure
          stood for the Unveiled Mystery. Hence, the world, not being ready
          to receive it, could not bear it, and the Revelation of Marcus had
          to be given allegorically. Thus he writes:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is as plain
          as ancient esoteric secresy could make it. It is as Kabalistic
          though less veiled than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, in which the mystic
          names, or attributes, are also four syllabled, twelve, forty-two,
          and even seventy-two syllabled words! The Tetrad shows to Marcus
          the Truth in the shape of a naked woman, and letters every limb of
          that figure, calling her head Α Ω, her neck Β Ψ, shoulders and
          hands Γ Χ, etc. In this, Sephira is easily recognized; the head, or
          Crown, Kether, being numbered 1; the brain, or Chokmah, 2; the
          Heart, or Intelligence, Binah, 3; and the other seven Sephiroth
          representing the limbs of the body. The Sephirothic Tree is the
          Universe, and Adam Kadmon personifies it in the West, as Brahmâ
          represents it in India.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout, the
          Ten Sephiroth are represented as divided into the Three higher, or
          the spiritual Triad, and the lower Septenary. The true esoteric
          meaning of the sacred number Seven though cleverly veiled, in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, is betrayed by the double
          way of writing the term, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
          Beginning,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Be-rasheeth</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Be-raishath</span></span>, the latter the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Higher, or Upper Wisdom.”</span> As shown
          by S. L. MacGregor Mathers<a href="#note_535" id="noteref_535" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a> and

          of these Kabalists being supported by the best ancient authorities,
          these words have a dual and secret meaning. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Braisheeth barah
          Elohim</span></span> means, that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six</span></em>,
          over which stands the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em> Sephira, belong to the
          lower material class, or, as the author says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven ... are applied to the Lower Creation, and Three
          to the Spiritual Man, the Heavenly Prototypic or First
          Adam.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the
          Theosophists and Occultists say that God is no Being, for It is
          Nothing, No-Thing, they are more reverential and religiously
          respectful to the Deity than those who call God <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></span>, and
          thus make of Him a gigantic Male.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He who studies
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> will soon find the same
          idea in the ultimate thought of its authors, the earlier and great
          Hebrew Initiates, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg
          377]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg377"></a>
          who got this Secret Wisdom in Babylonia from the Chaldean
          Hierophants, just as Moses got his in Egypt. The Zoharic system
          cannot very well be judged by its translations into Latin and other
          tongues, when all its ideas were softened and made to fit in with
          the views and policy of its Christian arrangers; for its original
          ideas are identical with those of all other religious systems. The
          various Cosmogonies show that the Universal Soul was considered by
          every archaic nation as the Mind of the Demiurgic Creator; and that
          it was called the Mother, Sophia, or the female Wisdom, with the
          Gnostics; the Sephira, with the Jews; Sarasvatî or Vâch, with the
          Hindûs; the Holy Ghost also being a female Principle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence, the
          Kurios, or Logos, born from it, was, with the Greeks, the God, Mind
          (Nous). <span class="tei tei-q">“Now Koros [Kurios] ... signifies
          the pure and unmixed nature of Intellect—Wisdom,”</span> says
          Plato, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cratylus</span></span>;<a href="#note_537" id="noteref_537" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">537</span></span></a> and
          Kurios is Mercury (Mercurius, Mar-kurios), the Divine Wisdom, and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mercury is Sol [the Sun],”</span><a href="#note_538" id="noteref_538" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a> from
          whom Thot-Hermes received this Divine Wisdom. While, then, the
          Logoi of all countries and religions are correlative, in their
          sexual aspects, with the female Soul of the World or the Great
          Deep, the Deity, from which these Two in One have their being, is
          ever concealed and called the Hidden One, and is connected only
          indirectly with <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation,”</span><a href="#note_539" id="noteref_539" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">539</span></span></a> as it
          can act only through the Dual Force emanating from the Eternal
          Essence. Even Æsculapius, called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Saviour of all,”</span> is identical, according to
          ancient classical writers, with the Egyptian Ptah, the Creative
          Intellect, or Divine Wisdom, and with Apollo, Baal, Adonis and
          Hercules:<a href="#note_540" id="noteref_540" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">540</span></span></a> and
          Ptah, in one of its aspects, is the Anima Mundi; the Universal Soul
          of Plato; the Divine Spirit of the Egyptians; the Holy Ghost of the
          early Christians and Gnostics; and the Âkâsha of the Hindûs, and
          even, in its lower aspect, the Astral Light. For Ptah was
          originally the God of the Dead, he into whose bosom they were
          received, hence the Limbus of the Greek Christians, or the Astral
          Light. It was far later that Ptah was classed with the Sun-Gods,
          his name signifying <span class="tei tei-q">“he who opens,”</span>
          as he is shown to be the first to unveil the face of the dead
          mummy, to call the Soul to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life in his bosom</span></em>. Kneph, the
          Eternal Unrevealed, is represented by the snake-emblem of eternity
          encircling a water-urn, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg
          378]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg378"></a>
          with its head hovering over the <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters,”</span> which it incubates with its
          breath—another form of the one original idea of <span class="tei tei-q">“Darkness,”</span> with its Ray moving on the Waters,
          etc. As the Logos-Soul, this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">permutation</span></em> is called Ptah; as the
          Logos-Creator, he becomes Imhotep, his Son, the <span class="tei tei-q">“God of the handsome face.”</span> In their primitive
          characters, these two were the first Cosmic Duad, Noot, Space or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sky,”</span> and Noon, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Primordial Waters,”</span> the Androgyne Unity, above
          whom was the Concealed Breath of Kneph. And all of them had the
          aquatic animals and plants sacred to them, the ibis, the swan, the
          goose, the crocodile, and the lotus.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning to the
          Kabalistic Deity, this Concealed Unity is then Ain Suph (אין סוף,
          τὸ πάν, τό ἄπειρον), Endless, Boundless, Non-Existent (אין), so
          long as the Absolute is within Oulom,<a href="#note_541" id="noteref_541" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> the
          Boundless and Termless Time; as such, Ain Suph cannot be the
          Creator or even the Modeller of the Universe, nor can It be Aur
          (Light). Therefore Ain Suph is also Darkness. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immutably</span></em> Infinite, and the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely</span></em> Boundless, can neither
          will, think, nor act. To do this, it has to become Finite, and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it</span></em> does so by its Ray penetrating
          into the Mundane Egg, or Infinite Space, and emanating from it as a
          Finite God. All this is left to the Ray latent in the One. When the
          period arrives, the Absolute Will expands naturally the Force
          within it, according to the Law of which it is the inner and
          ultimate Essence. The Hebrews did not adopt the Egg as a symbol,
          but they substituted for it the <span class="tei tei-q">“Duplex
          Heavens,”</span> for, translated correctly, the sentence
          <span class="tei tei-q">“God made the heavens and the earth”</span>
          would read: <span class="tei tei-q">“In and out of his own Essence,
          as a Womb [the Mundane Egg], God created the Two Heavens.”</span>
          The Christians, however, have chosen the Dove, the bird and not the
          egg, as the symbol of their Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever acquaints himself with Hud, the Mercabah and
          the Lahgash [secret speech or incantation], will learn the secret
          of secrets.”</span> Lahgash is nearly identical in meaning with
          Vâch, the hidden power of the Mantras.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the active
          period has arrived, from within the Eternal Essence of Ain Suph,
          comes forth Sephira, the Active Power, called the Primordial Point
          and the Crown, Kether. It is only through her that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Un-bounded Wisdom”</span> could give a Concrete Form
          to the Abstract <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg
          379]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg379"></a>
          Thought. Two sides of the Upper Triangle, by which the Ineffable
          Essence and its Manifested Body, the Universe, are symbolized, the
          right side and the base, are composed of unbroken lines; the third,
          the left side, is dotted. It is through the latter that emerges
          Sephira. Spreading in every direction, she finally encompasses the
          whole Triangle. In this emanation the triple Triad is formed. From
          the invisible Dew falling from the higher Uni-triad, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Head,”</span>—thus leaving 7 Sephiroth
          only—Sephira <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">creates</span></em> Primeval Waters, or in
          other words, Chaos takes shape. It is the first stage towards the
          solidification of Spirit which, through various modifications, will
          produce Earth. <span class="tei tei-q">“It requires Earth and Water
          to make a Living Soul,”</span> says Moses. It requires the image of
          an aquatic bird to connect it with Water, the female element of
          procreation, with the egg and the bird that fecundates it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Sephira
          emerges as an Active Power from within the Latent Deity, she is
          female; when she assumes the office of a Creator, she becomes a
          male; hence, she is androgyne. She is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Father and Mother, Aditi,”</span> of the Hindû
          Cosmogony and of the Secret Doctrine. If the oldest Hebrew scrolls
          had been preserved, the modern Jehovah-worshipper would have found
          that many and uncomely were the symbols of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Creative God.”</span> The frog in the moon, typical of
          his generative character, was the most frequent. All the birds and
          animals now called <span class="tei tei-q">“unclean”</span> in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> have been the symbols of
          this Deity, in days of old. A mask of uncleanness was placed over
          them, in order to preserve them from destruction, because they were
          so sacred. The brazen serpent is not a bit more poetical than the
          goose or swan, if symbols are to be accepted <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à la
          lettre</span></span>.</p>

          Sephira the third, the Jewish Trinity or the Crown, Kether. These
          two Sephiroth, called Abba, Father, and Amona, Mother, are the
          Duad, or the double-sexed Logos, from which issued the other seven
          Sephiroth. Thus, the first Jewish Triad, Sephira, Chokmah and
          Binah, is the Hindû Trimûrti.<a href="#note_543" id="noteref_543" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a>
          However veiled even in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>, and still more in the
          exoteric Pantheon of India, every particular connected with one is
          reproduced in the other. The Prajâpatis are the Sephiroth. Ten with
          Brahmâ, they dwindle to seven when the Trimûrti, or the Kabalistic
          Triad, are separated from the rest. The seven Builders, or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Creators,”</span> become the seven
          Prajâpati, or the seven Rishis, in the same order as the Sephiroth
          become the Creators, then the Patriarchs, etc. In both Secret
          Systems, the One Universal Essence is incomprehensible and
          inactive, in its Absoluteness, and can be connected with the
          Building of the Universe only in an indirect way. In both, the
          primeval Male-female, or Androgynous, Principle and its ten and
          seven Emanations—Brahmâ-Virâj and Aditi-Vâch, on the one hand; and
          the Elohim-Jehovah, or Adam-Adami (Adam Kadmon) and Sephira-Eve, on
          the other; with their Prajâpatis and Sephiroth—in their totality,
          represent primarily the Archetypal Man, the Protologos; and it is
          only in their secondary aspect that they become cosmic powers, and
          astronomical or sidereal bodies. If Aditi is the Mother of the
          Gods, Deva-Mâtri, Eve is the Mother of All Living; both are the
          Shakti, or Generative Power, in their female aspect, of the
          Heavenly Man, and they are both compound Creators. Says a Guptâ
          Vidyâ Sûtra:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The symbol
          chosen for the majestic ideal of the Universal Principle may
          perhaps seem little calculated to answer its sacred character. A
          goose, or even a swan, will, no doubt, be thought an unfit symbol
          to represent the grandeur of the Spirit. Nevertheless, it must have
          had some deep Occult meaning, since it figures not only in every
          Cosmogony and World-religion, but was also chosen by the Crusaders,
          among the mediæval Christians, as the Vehicle of the Holy Ghost,
          which was supposed to be leading the army to Palestine, to wrench
          the tomb of the Saviour from the hands of the Saracen. If we are to
          credit Professor Draper's statement, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Intellectual
          Development of Europe</span></span>, the Crusaders, under Peter the
          Hermit, were preceded, at the head of the army, by the Holy Ghost,
          under the shape of a white gander in the company of a goat. Seb,
          the Egyptian God of Time, carries a goose on his head; Jupiter
          assumes the form of a swan, and so also does Brahmâ; and the root
          of all this is that mystery of mysteries—the Mundane Egg. One
          should learn the reason of a symbol before depreciating it. The
          dual element of Air and Water is that of the ibis, swan, goose and
          pelican, of crocodiles and frogs, lotus flowers and water lilies,
          etc.; and the result is the choice of the most unseemly symbols by
          the modern as much as by the ancient Mystics. Pan, the great God of
          Nature, was generally figured in company with aquatic birds, geese
          especially, and so were other Gods. If later on, with the gradual
          degeneration of religion, the Gods to whom geese were sacred,
          became priapic deities, it does not, therefore, follow that
          water-fowls were made sacred to Pan and other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page383">[pg 383]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg383"></a> phallic deities, as some scoffers even
          of antiquity would have it,<a href="#note_550" id="noteref_550" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> but
          that the abstract and divine power of Procreative Nature had become
          grossly anthropomorphized. Nor does the swan of Leda show
          <span class="tei tei-q">“priapic doings and her enjoyment
          thereof,”</span> as Mr. Hargrave Jennings chastely expresses it;
          for the myth is but another version of the same philosophical idea
          of Cosmogony. Swans are frequently found associated with Apollo, as
          they are the emblems of Water and Fire, and also of the Sun-light,
          before the separation of the Elements.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our modern
          symbologists might profit by some remarks made by a well-known
          writer, Mrs. Lydia Maria Child, who says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">From time immemorial an emblem has been worshipped
          in Hindûstan as the type of creation, or the origin of life....

          forms, but also the fructifying principle, the generative power
          that pervades the Universe. The maternal emblem is likewise a
          religious type. This reverence for the production of life
          introduced into the worship of Osiris the sexual emblems. Is it
          strange that they regarded with reverence the great mystery of
          human birth? Were they impure thus to regard it? Or are</span>

          mode of tracing the infinite and the incomprehensible Cause

<span style="font-size: 144%">Section VI. The Mundane
          Egg.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whence this
          universal symbol? The Egg was incorporated as a sacred sign in the
          Cosmogony of every people on the earth, and was revered both on
          account of its form and of its inner mystery. From the earliest
          mental conceptions of man, it has been known as that which
          represented most successfully the origin and secret of Being. The
          gradual development of the imperceptible germ within the closed
          shell; the inward working, without any apparent outward
          interference of force, which from a latent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></em>
          produced an active <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something</span></em>, needing naught save
          heat; and which, having gradually evolved into a concrete, living
          creature, broke its shell, appearing to the outward senses of all
          as a self-generated and self-created being; all this must have been
          a standing miracle from the beginning.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Secret
          Teaching explains the reason for this reverence by the symbolism of
          the prehistoric races. In the beginnings, the <span class="tei tei-q">“First Cause”</span> had no name. Later it was pictured
          in the fancy of the thinkers as an ever invisible, mysterious Bird
          that dropped an Egg into Chaos, which Egg became the Universe.
          Hence Brahmâ was called Kâlahansa, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Swan in [Space and] Time.”</span> Becoming the Swan of
          Eternity, Brahmâ, at the beginning of each Mahâmanvantara, lays a
          Golden Egg, which typifies the great Circle, or [circle] itself a
          symbol for the Universe and its spherical bodies.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A second reason
          for the Egg having been chosen as the symbolical representation of
          the Universe, and of our Earth, was its form. It was a Circle and a
          Sphere; and the ovi-form shape of our Globe must have been known
          from the beginning of symbology, since it was so universally
          adopted. The first manifestation of the Kosmos in the form of an
          Egg was the most widely diffused belief of Antiquity. As Bryant
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg385"></a> shows,<a href="#note_552" id="noteref_552" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> it
          was a symbol adopted among the Greeks, the Syrians, Persians, and
          Egyptians. In the Egyptian <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ritual</span></span>, Seb, the God of Time and
          of the Earth, is spoken of as having laid an Egg, or the Universe,
          an <span class="tei tei-q">“Egg conceived at the hour of the Great
          One of the Dual Force.”</span><a href="#note_553" id="noteref_553" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the Greeks
          the Orphic Egg is described by Aristophanes, and was part of the
          Dionysiac and other Mysteries, during which the Mundane Egg was
          consecrated and its significance explained; Porphyry also shows it
          to be a representation of the world: <span class="tei tei-q">“Ἑρμηνεύει δὲ τὸ ὠὸν τὸν κόσμον.”</span> Faber and
          Bryant have tried to show that the Egg typified the Ark of Noah—a
          wild belief, unless the latter is accepted as purely allegorical
          and symbolical. It can only have typified the Ark as a synonym of

          to the ancient manuscripts of Boethius' treatise, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Arithmetica</span></span>, composed in the sixth century, to find
          among the Pythagorean numerals the <span class="tei tei-q">“1”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“0,”</span>
          as the first and final figures.<a href="#note_564" id="noteref_564" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> And

          that the numerals of Pythagoras were <span class="tei tei-q">“hieroglyphical symbols, by means whereof he explained
          ideas concerning the nature of things,”</span> or the origin of the
          Universe.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, if, on the
          one hand, the most ancient Indian MSS. show as yet no trace of
          decimal notation in them, and Max Müller states very clearly that
          until now he has found but nine letters, the initials of the
          Sanskrit numerals; on the other hand, we have records as ancient,
          to supply the wanted proof. We speak of the sculptures and the
          sacred <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg
          387]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg387"></a>
          imagery in the most ancient temples of the far East. Pythagoras
          derived his knowledge from India; and we find Professor Max Müller
          corroborating this statement, at least so far as to allow that the
          Neo-Pythagoreans were the first teachers of <span class="tei tei-q">“ciphering,”</span> among the Greeks and Romans; that
          they <span class="tei tei-q">“at Alexandria, or in Syria, became
          acquainted with the Indian figures, and adapted them to the
          Pythagorean Abacus.”</span> This cautious admission implies that
          Pythagoras himself was acquainted with only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine</span></em>
          figures. Thus we might reasonably answer that, although we possess
          no certain proof, exoterically, that the decimal notation was known
          to Pythagoras, who lived at the very close of the archaic
          ages,<a href="#note_566" id="noteref_566" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> yet
          we have sufficient evidence to show that the full numbers, as given
          by Boethius, were known to the Pythagoreans, even before Alexandria
          was built.<a href="#note_567" id="noteref_567" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a> This
          evidence we find in Aristotle, who says that <span class="tei tei-q">“some philosophers hold that ideas and numbers are of
          the same nature, and amount to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ten</span></em> in
          all.”</span><a href="#note_568" id="noteref_568" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a> This,
          we believe, will be sufficient to show that the decimal notation
          was known among them at least as early as four centuries
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, for Aristotle does
          not seem to treat the question as an innovation of the
          Neo-Pythagoreans.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we know more
          than this; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we know</span></em> that the decimal system
          must have been used by the mankind of the earliest archaic ages,
          since the whole astronomical and geometrical portion of the secret
          sacerdotal language was built upon the number 10, or the
          combination of the male and female principles, and since the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Pyramid of Cheops,”</span> so-called, is
          built upon measures of this decimal notation, or rather upon the
          digits and their combinations with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nought</span></em>.
          Of this, however, sufficient has been said in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span>, and it is useless to repeat it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The symbolism of
          the Lunar and Solar Deities is so inextricably mixed up, that it is
          next to impossible to separate from each other such glyphs as the
          Egg, the Lotus, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred”</span>
          Animals. The Ibis, for instance, was held in the greatest
          veneration in Egypt. It was sacred to Isis, who is often
          represented with the head of that bird, and also sacred to Mercury
          or Thoth, who is said to have assumed its form while escaping from
          Typhon. There were two kinds of Ibises in Egypt, Herodotus<a href="#note_569" id="noteref_569" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a> tells
          us; one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite black</span></em>, the other black and
          white. The former is credited with fighting and exterminating the
          winged serpents which came every spring from Arabia, and infested
          the country. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page388">[pg
          388]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg388"></a>
          The other was sacred to the Moon, because the latter planet is
          white and brilliant on her external side, dark and black on that
          side which she never turns to the Earth. Moreover, the Ibis kills
          land serpents, and makes the most terrible havoc amongst the eggs
          of the crocodile, and thus saves Egypt from having the Nile
          over-infested by those horrible saurians. The bird is credited with
          doing this in the moonlight, and thus being helped by Isis, whose
          sidereal symbol is the Moon. But the more correct esoteric truth
          underlying these popular myths is, that Hermes, as shown by
          Abenephius,<a href="#note_570" id="noteref_570" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a>
          watched over the Egyptians under the form of that bird, and taught
          them the Occult arts and sciences. This simply means that the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ibis
          religiosa</span></span> had, and has, <span class="tei tei-q">“magical”</span> properties in common with many other
          birds, the albatross preëminently, and the mythical white swan, the
          Swan of Eternity or Time, the Kâlahansa.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Were it
          otherwise, indeed, why should all the ancient peoples, who were no
          more fools than we are, have had such a superstitious dread of
          killing certain birds? In Egypt, he who killed an Ibis, or the
          Golden Hawk, the symbol of the Sun and Osiris, risked death, and
          could hardly escape it. The veneration of some nations for birds
          was such that Zoroaster, in his precepts, forbids their slaughter
          as a heinous crime. In our age, we laugh at every kind of
          divination. Yet why should so many generations have believed in
          divination by birds, and even in Oömancy, which is said by Suidas
          to have been imparted by Orpheus, who taught how, under certain
          conditions, to perceive in the yolk and white of an egg, that which
          the bird born from it would have seen around it during its short
          life. This Occult art, which, 3,000 years ago, demanded the
          greatest learning and the most abstruse mathematical calculations,
          has now fallen into the depths of degradation; and to-day it is the
          old cooks and fortune-tellers who read the future for servant-girls
          in search of husbands, from the white of an egg in a glass.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          even Christians have to this day their sacred birds; for instance,
          the Dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost. Nor have they neglected the
          sacred animals; and the evangelical zoölatry, with its Bull, Eagle,
          Dion, and Angel—in reality the Cherub, or Seraph, the fiery-winged
          Serpent—is as much Pagan as that of the Egyptians or the Chaldeans.
          These four animals are, in reality, the symbols of the four
          Elements, and of the four <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lower</span></em> Principles in man.
          Nevertheless, they correspond physically and materially to the four
          constellations <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg
          389]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg389"></a>
          that form, so to speak, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">suite</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">cortège</span></span> of the Solar God, and
          which, during the winter solstice, occupy the four cardinal points
          of the zodiacal circle. These four <span class="tei tei-q">“animals”</span> may be seen in many of the Roman
          Catholic <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testaments</span></span> in which the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“portraits”</span> of the Evangelists are
          given. They are the animals of Ezekiel's Mercabah.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As truly stated

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They can be only
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">approximately</span></em> interpreted, even if
          one discovers three out of these seven systems, viz., the
          anthropological, the psychic and the astronomical. The two chief
          interpretations, the highest and the lowest, the spiritual and the
          physiological, were preserved in the greatest secrecy, until the
          latter fell into the dominion of the profane. Thus far, with regard
          only to the pre-historic Hierophants, with whom that which has now
          become purely—or impurely—phallic, was a science as profound and as
          mysterious as Biology and Physiology are now. This was their
          exclusive property, the fruit of their studies and discoveries. The
          other two were those which dealt with the Creative Gods, or
          Theogony, and with creative man; that is to say, with the ideal and
          the practical Mysteries. These interpretations were so cleverly
          veiled and combined, that many were those who, while arriving at
          the discovery of one meaning, were baffled in understanding the
          significance of the others, and could never unriddle them
          sufficiently to commit dangerous indiscretions. The highest, the
          first and the fourth—Theogony in relation to Anthropogony—were
          almost impossible to fathom. We find the proofs of this in the
          Jewish <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy Writ.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is owing to
          the serpent being oviparous, that it became a symbol of Wisdom and
          an emblem of the Logoi, or the Self-Born. In the temple of Philæ,
          in Upper Egypt, an egg was artificially prepared of clay mixed with
          various incenses. This was hatched by a peculiar process, and a
          cerastes or horned viper was produced. The same was done in the
          Indian temples, in antiquity, in the case of the cobra. The
          Creative God emerges from the Egg that issues from the mouth of
          Kneph, as a winged Serpent, for the Serpent is the symbol of the
          All-Wisdom. With the Hebrews the same Deity is glyphed by the
          Flying or <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery Serpents”</span> of Moses
          in the Wilderness; and with the Alexandrian Mystic she becomes the
          Orphio-Christos, the Logos of the Gnostics. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg390"></a> The Protestants try to show that the
          allegory of the Brazen Serpent and of the Fiery Serpents has a
          direct reference to the mystery of the Christ and the Crucifixion,
          whereas, in truth, it has a far nearer relation to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mystery of
          generation</span></em>, when dissociated from the Egg with the
          Central Germ, or the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Circle with its Central Point</span></em>.
          Protestant Theologians would have us believe their interpretation
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> because the Brazen Serpent
          was lifted on a pole! Whereas it had rather a reference to the
          Egyptian Egg standing upright supported by the sacred Tau; since
          the Egg and the Serpent are in-separable in the old worship and
          symbology of Egypt, and since both the Brazen and Fiery Serpents
          were Seraphs, the burning <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery”</span>
          Messengers, or the Serpent Gods, the Nâgas of India. Without the
          Egg it was a purely phallic symbol, but when associated therewith,
          it related to cosmic creation. The Brazen Serpent had no such holy
          meaning as the Protestants would ascribe to it; nor was it, in
          fact, glorified above the Fiery Serpents, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">for the bite of which
          it was only a natural remedy</span></span>; the symbological
          meaning of the word <span class="tei tei-q">“Brazen”</span> being
          the feminine principle, and that of <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Gold,”</span> the masculine principle.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“any man when he beheld the serpent of
          brass ... <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lived</span></em>”</span> (?). After that the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord,”</span> gathering the people
          together at the well of Beer, gave them water, and grateful Israel
          sang this song, <span class="tei tei-q">“Spring up, O well.”</span>
          When, after studying symbology, the Christian reader comes to
          understand the innermost meaning of these three symbols, Water,
          Brazen, and Serpent, and a few more, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the sense given
          to them in the Holy Bible</span></em>, he will hardly like to
          connect the sacred name of his Saviour with the Brazen Serpent
          incident. The Seraphim (שרפים) or Fiery Winged Serpents, are no
          doubt connected with, and inseparable from, the idea of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Serpent of Eternity—God,”</span> as
          explained in Kenealy's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apocalypse</span></span>; but the word Cherub
          also meant Serpent, in one sense, though its direct meaning is
          different, for the Cherubim and the Persian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg391"></a> Winged Griffins (Γρύπες), the guardians
          of the Golden Mountain, are the same, and the compound name of the
          former shows their character, as it is formed of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">kr</span></span>
          (כר), a circle, and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aub</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ob</span></span>
          (אוב), a serpent, and therefore means a <span class="tei tei-q">“serpent in a circle.”</span> And this settles the
          phallic character of the Brazen Serpent, and justifies Hezekiah for
          breaking it.<a href="#note_572" id="noteref_572" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a>

          reference is often made to the Egg. Ra, the Mighty One, remains in
          his Egg, during the struggle between the <span class="tei tei-q">“Children of the Rebellion”</span> and Shoo, the Solar
          Energy and the Dragon of Darkness. The Deceased is resplendent in
          his Egg when he crosses to the Land of Mystery. He is the Egg of
          Seb. The Egg was the symbol of Life in Immortality and Eternity;
          and also the glyph of the generative matrix; whereas the Tau, which
          was associated with it, was only the symbol of life and birth in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generation</span></em>. The Mundane Egg was
          placed in Khoom, the Water of Space, or the feminine <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> Principle; Khoom
          becoming, with the <span class="tei tei-q">“fall”</span> of mankind
          into generation and phallicism, Ammon the Creative God. When Ptah,
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Fiery God,”</span> carries the Mundane
          Egg in his hand, then the symbolism becomes quite terrestrial and
          concrete in its significance. In conjunction with the Hawk, the
          symbol of Osiris-Sun, the symbol is dual, and relates to both
          Lives—the mortal and the immortal. The engraving of a papyrus in
          Kircher's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Œdipus Egyptiacus</span></span>,<a href="#note_574" id="noteref_574" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> shows
          an egg floating above the mummy. This is the symbol of hope and the
          promise of a Second Birth for the Osirified Dead; his Soul, after
          due purification in the Amenti, will gestate in this Egg of
          Immortality, to be reborn therefrom into a new life on earth. For
          this Egg, in the Esoteric Doctrine, is Devachan, the Abode of
          Bliss; the Winged Scarabæus also being another symbol of it. The
          Winged Globe is but another form of the Egg, and has the same
          significance as the Scarabæus, the Khopiroo—from the Root
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">khoproo</span></span>, to become, to be
          reborn—which relates to the rebirth of man, as well as to his
          spiritual regeneration.</p>

          Light of the Kabalist and the Occultist, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Egg of Darkness.”</span> Besides this there are many
          charming allegories on this subject, scattered through the Sacred
          Books of the Brâhmans. In one place, it is the female creator who
          is first a germ, then a drop of heavenly dew, a pearl, and then an
          Egg. In such cases, of which there are too many to enumerate
          separately, the Egg gives birth to the four Elements within the
          fifth, Æther, and is covered with seven coverings, which become
          later on the seven upper and the seven lower worlds. Breaking in
          two, the shell becomes the Heaven, and the contents the Earth, the
          white forming the Terrestrial Waters. Then, again, it is Vishnu who
          emerges from within the Egg, with a Lotus in his hand. Vinatâ, a
          daughter of Daksha and wife of Kashyapa, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Self-born, sprung from Time,”</span> one of the
          seven <span class="tei tei-q">“Creators”</span> of our World,
          brought forth an Egg from which was born Garuda, the Vehicle of
          Vishnu; the latter allegory having a relation to our Earth, as
          Garuda is the Great Cycle.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Egg was
          sacred to Isis; and therefore the priests of Egypt never ate

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Diodorus Siculus
          states that Osiris was born from an Egg, like Brahmâ. From Leda's
          Egg, Apollo and Latona were born, and also Castor and Pollux, the
          bright Gemini. And though the Buddhists do not attribute the same
          origin to their Founder, yet, no more than the ancient Egyptians or
          the modern Brâhmans, do they eat eggs, lest they should destroy the
          germ of life latent in them, and thereby commit sin. The Chinese
          believe that their First Man was born from an Egg, which Tien
          dropped down from Heaven to Earth into the Waters.<a href="#note_578" id="noteref_578" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> This

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ovum</span></em> is invisible to the naked
          eye. Therefore we see respect shown to it from the remotest
          antiquity, by the Greeks, Phœnicians, Romans, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg393"></a> Japanese, and the Siamese, the North

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          Egyptians, the Concealed God was Ammon or Mon, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hidden”</span>, the Supreme Spirit. All their Gods
          were dual—the scientific <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Reality</span></em> for the sanctuary; its
          double, the fabulous and mythical Entity, for the masses. For
          instance, as observed in the Section <span class="tei tei-q">“Chaos, Theos, Kosmos,”</span> the Elder Horus was the
          Idea of the World remaining in the Demiurgic Mind, <span class="tei tei-q">“born in Darkness before the Creation of the
          World”</span>; the Second Horus was the same Idea going forth from
          the Logos, becoming clothed with matter and assuming an actual
          existence.<a href="#note_579" id="noteref_579" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a>
          Horus, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elder,”</span> or Haroiri, is
          an ancient aspect of the Solar God, contemporary with Ra and Shoo;
          Haroiri is often mistaken for Hor (Horsusi), Son of Osiris and
          Isis. The Egyptians very often represented the rising Sun under the
          form of Hor, the Elder, rising from a full-blown Lotus, the
          Universe, when the solar disk is always found on the hawk-head of
          that God. Haroiri is Khnoom. The same with Khnoom and Ammon, both
          are represented as ram-headed, and both are often confused, though
          their functions are different. Khnoom is the <span class="tei tei-q">“modeller of men,”</span> fashioning men and things out
          of the Mundane Egg, on a potter's wheel; Ammon-Ra, the Generator,
          is the secondary aspect of the Concealed Deity. Khnoom was adored
          at Elephanta and Philæ,<a href="#note_580" id="noteref_580" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> Ammon
          at Thebes. But it is Emepht, the One, Supreme Planetary Principle,
          who blows the Egg out of his mouth, and who is, therefore, Brahmâ.
          The Shadow of the Deity, Kosmic and Universal, of that which broods
          over and permeates the Egg with its vivifying Spirit, until the
          Germ contained in it is ripe, was the Mystery God whose name was
          unpronounceable. It is Ptah, however, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
          who opens,”</span> the opener of Life and Death,<a href="#note_581" id="noteref_581" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> who

          represented as lying in the Ginnungagap, the Cup of Illusion, Mâyâ,
          the Boundless and Void Abyss. In this World's Matrix, formerly a

          overflowed this cup and froze in it. Then the Invisible blew a
          scorching Wind which dissolved the frozen Waters and cleared the

          from the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Puranâs</span></span>. He must never take the
          statements found therein literally, and in one sense only; and
          those especially, which concern the Manvantaras, or Kalpas, have to
          be understood in their several references. Thus these Ages relate,
          in the same language, to both the great and the small periods, to
          Mahâ Kalpas and to Minor Cycles. The Matsya, or Fish Avatâra,
          happened before the Varâha or Boar Avatâra; the allegories,
          therefore, must relate to both the Padma and the present
          Manvantara, and also to the Minor Cycles which have occurred since
          the reäppearance of our Chain of Worlds and the Earth. And as the
          Matsya Avatâra of Vishnu and Vaivasvata's Deluge are correctly
          connected with an event that happened on our Earth during this
          Round, it is evident that, while it may relate to pre-cosmic
          events, pre-cosmic in the sense of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em>
          Cosmos, or Solar System, it has reference, in our case, to a
          distant geological period. Not even Esoteric Philosophy can claim
          to know, except by analogical inference, that which took place
          before the reäppearance of our Solar System, and previous to the
          last Mahâ Pralaya. But it teaches distinctly, that after the first
          geological disturbance of the Earth's axis, which ended in the
          sweeping down to the bottom of the seas of the whole Second
          Continent, with its primeval races—of which successive Continents,
          or <span class="tei tei-q">“Earths,”</span> Atlantis was the
          fourth—there came another disturbance owing to the axis again
          resuming its previous degree of inclination as rapidly as it had
          changed it: when the Earth was indeed once more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">raised</span></em>
          out of the waters—as above, so below, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice
          versâ</span></span>. There were <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods”</span> on Earth in those days; Gods, and not
          men, as we know them now, says the tradition. As will be shown in
          Volume II, the computation of periods, in exoteric Hindûism, refers
          to both the great cosmic and the small terrestrial events and
          cataclysms, and the same may be demonstrated in respect to names.
          For instance, the name Yudishthira—the first king of the Sacae or
          Shakas, who opens the Kali Yuga Era, which has to last 432,000
          years, <span class="tei tei-q">“an actual king who lived 3,102
          years <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>”</span>—applies also
          to the Great Deluge, at the time of the first sinking of Atlantis.
          He is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Yudishthira,<a href="#note_585" id="noteref_585" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a> born
          on the mountain of the hundred peaks, at the extremity of the
          world, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond which nobody can</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg397"></a><span style="font-style: italic">go</span></em>”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“immediately after the flood.”</span><a href="#note_586" id="noteref_586" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> We

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This relates to
          an esoteric division of time and a mystery explained elsewhere, and
          may therefore be left aside for the present. Suffice it to remark,
          at this juncture, that all the efforts of imagination of the
          Wilfords, Bentleys, and other would-be Œdipuses of esoteric Hindû
          Chronology, have sadly failed. No computation of either the Four
          Ages, or the Manvantaras, has ever yet been unriddled by our very
          learned Orientalists, who have therefore cut the Gordian Knot by
          proclaiming the whole <span class="tei tei-q">“a figment of the
          Brâhmanical brain.”</span> So be it, and may the great scholars
          rest in peace! This <span class="tei tei-q">“figment”</span> is

          Destroyer (Shiva), and reünites all his creatures to himself. He
          enters the Seven Rays of the Sun and drinks up all the Waters of
          the Globe; he causes the moisture to evaporate, thus drying up the
          whole Earth. Oceans and rivers, torrents and small streams, are all
          exhaled. Thus fed with abundant moisture the Seven Solar Rays
          become Seven Suns, by dilation, and they finally set the World on
          fire. Hari, the destroyer of all things, who is the Flame of Time,
          Kâlâgni, finally consumes the Earth. Then Rudra, becoming
          Janârdana, breathes clouds and rain.</span><a href="#note_587" id="noteref_587" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
          kinds of Pralaya, but three chief periods are specially mentioned
          in old Hindû books. The first of these, as Wilson shows, is called
          Naimittika,<a href="#note_588" id="noteref_588" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Occasional”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Incidental,”</span> caused by the intervals of
          Brahmâ's Days; it is the destruction of creatures, of all that
          lives and has a form, but not of the substance, which remains in
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg398"></a> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">statu
          quo</span></span> till the new Dawn after that Night. The second is
          called Prâkritika, and occurs at the end of the Age or Life of
          Brahmâ, when everything that exists is resolved into the Primal
          Element, to be remodelled at the end of that longer Night. The
          third, Âtyantika, does not concern the Worlds, or the Universe, but
          only the Individualities of some people. It is thus the Individual
          Pralaya, or Nirvâna, after having reached which, there is no more
          future existence possible, no rebirth till after the Mahâ Pralaya.
          The latter Night—lasting as it does 311,040,000,000,000 years, with
          the possibility also of being almost doubled in the case of the
          lucky Jîvanmukta who reaches Nirvâna at an early period of a
          Manvantara—is long enough to be regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em>, if not endless. The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhâgavata

          speaks of a fourth kind of Pralaya, the Nitya, or Constant
          Dissolution, and explains it as the change which takes place
          imperceptibly in everything in this Universe from the globe down to
          the atom, without cessation. It is growth and decay—life and
          death.</p>

          long their duration. The Creative Force is Eternal as noumenal; as
          a phenomenal manifestation, in its aspects, it has a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg401"></a> beginning and must, therefore, have an
          end. During that interval, it has its Periods of Activity and its
          Periods of Rest. And these are the Days and Nights of Brahmâ. But
          Brahman, the Noumenon, never rests, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It</span></em>
          never changes, but ever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>, though It cannot be said to be
          anywhere.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Jewish
          Kabalists felt the necessity of this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immutability</span></em> in an eternal,
          infinite Deity, and therefore applied the same thought to the
          anthropomorphic God. The idea is poetical, and very appropriate in
          its application. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span> we read as follows:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">As Moses was keeping a vigil on Mount Sinai, in
          company with the Deity, who was concealed from his sight by a
          cloud, he felt a great fear overcome him, and suddenly
          asked:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">
            “</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Lord, where art thou ...
            sleepest thou, O Lord? ...</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">And
            the Spirit answered him;</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">I never sleep: were I to fall asleep for a

            would crumble into dissolution in one instant.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q">“Before my time”</span> is very suggestive. It shows
          the God of Moses to be only a temporary substitute, like Brahmâ,
          the male, a substitute and an aspect of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span> which is immutable,
          and which, therefore, can take no part in the Days, or Nights, nor
          have any concern whatever with reäction or dissolution.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          Eastern Occultists have seven modes of interpretation, the Jews
          have only four; namely, the real-mystical, the allegorical, the
          moral, and the literal or Pashut. The latter is the key of the
          exoteric Churches and not worth discussion. Here are several
          sentences, which, read in the first, or mystical key, show the
          identity of the foundations of construction in every Scripture.

          <span class="tei tei-q">“B'raisheeth,”</span> the First Emanation,
          or Logos, and who are called, therefore, the Builders of the Lower
          or Physical Universe, all belonging Below. These Six [6-pointed
          star with middle dot], whose essence is of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Seventh</span></em>, are the Upâdhi, the Base
          or Fundamental Stone, on which the Objective Universe is built, the
          Noumenoi of all things. Hence they are, at the same time, the
          Forces of Nature; the Seven Angels of the Presence; the Sixth and
          Seventh Principles in Man; the spirito-psycho-physical Spheres of
          the Septenary Chain, the Root Races, etc. They all <span class="tei tei-q">“depend upon the Seven Forms of the Cranium”</span> up
          to the Highest. The <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Second</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">‘Earth’</span> does not come into

          Earth</span></em>, but the Chaos, or Abyss of Space, in which
          rested the Paradigmatic, or Model Universe, in the Ideation of the
          Over-Soul, brooding over it. The term <span class="tei tei-q">“Curse”</span> is here very misleading, for it means
          simply Doom or Destiny, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that fatality which sent it forth</span></em>
          into the objective state. This is shown by that <span class="tei tei-q">“Earth,”</span> under the <span class="tei tei-q">“Curse,”</span> being described as <span class="tei tei-q">“without form and void,”</span> in whose abysmal depths
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Breath”</span> of the Elohim, or
          collective Logoi, produced, or so to say photographed, the first
          Divine Ideation of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things to be</span></em>. This process is
          repeated after every Pralaya before the beginnings of a new
          Manvantara, or Period of sentient individual Being. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thirteen depend on thirteen Forms,”</span> refers to
          the thirteen Periods, personified by the thirteen Manus, with
          Svâyambhuva, the fourteenth—13, instead of 14, being an additional
          veil—those fourteen Manus who reign within the term of a Mahâ Yuga,
          a Day of Brahmâ. These thirteen-fourteen of the objective Universe
          depend on the thirteen-fourteen paradigmatic, ideal Forms. The
          meaning of the <span class="tei tei-q">“six thousand Years”</span>
          which <span class="tei tei-q">“hang in the first six Words,”</span>
          has again to be sought in the Indian Wisdom. They refer to the
          primordial six (seven) <span class="tei tei-q">“Kings of
          Edom,”</span> who typify the Worlds, or Spheres, of our Chain,
          during the First Round, as well as the primordial men of this
          Round. They are the septenary pre-Adamic First Root-Race, or they
          who existed before the Third, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Separated</span></em> Race. As they were
          Shadows, and senseless, for they had not yet eaten of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg403"></a> fruit of the Tree of
          Knowledge, they could not see the Parzuphim, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Face could not see Face”</span>; that is to say,
          primeval men were <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious.”</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore, the primordial (seven) Kings

          the millennium of exoteric Christianity, but that of
          Anthropogenesis, represents both the <span class="tei tei-q">“Seventh Period of Creation,”</span> that of physical
          man, according to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu Purâna</span></span>, and the Seventh
          Principle, both macrocosmic and microcosmic, and also the Pralaya
          after the Seventh Period, the Night, which has the same duration as
          the Day, of Brahmâ. <span class="tei tei-q">“It was rendered

<span style="font-size: 144%">Section VIII. The Lotus, as a
          Universal Symbol.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are no
          ancient symbols without a deep and philosophical meaning attached
          to them, their importance and significance increasing with their
          antiquity. Such is the Lotus. It is the flower sacred to Nature and
          her Gods, and represents the Abstract and the Concrete Universes,
          standing as the emblem of the productive powers of both Spiritual
          and Physical Nature. It was held as sacred from the remotest
          antiquity by the Âryan Hindûs, the Egyptians, and by the Buddhists
          after them. It was revered in China and Japan, and adopted as a
          Christian emblem by the Greek and Latin Churches, who made of it a
          messenger, as do now the Christians, who have replaced it with the
          water-lily.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Christian
          religion, in every picture of the Annunciation, Gabriel, the
          Archangel, appears to the Virgin Mary, holding in his hand a spray
          of water-lilies. This spray, typifying Fire and Water, or the idea
          of creation and generation, symbolizes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">precisely the same
          idea</span></em> as the Lotus, in the hand of the Bodhisattva who
          announces to Mahâ-Mâyâ, Gautama's mother, the birth of Buddha, the
          world's Saviour. Thus also, were Osiris and Horus constantly
          represented by the Egyptians in association with the Lotus-flower,
          both being Sun-Gods or Gods of Fire; just as the Holy Ghost is
          still typified by <span class="tei tei-q">“tongues of fire,”</span>
          in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acts</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had, and
          still has, its mystic meaning, which is identical in every nation
          on earth. We refer the reader to Sir William Jones.<a href="#note_612" id="noteref_612" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a> With
          the Hindûs, the Lotus is the emblem of the productive power of
          Nature, through the agency of Fire and Water, or Spirit and Matter.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“O Thou <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg407"></a> Eternal! I see Brahm, the Creator, enthroned
          in thee above the Lotus!”</span> says a verse in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavad
          Gîtâ</span></span>. And Sir W. Jones shows, as already noted in the
          Stanzas, that the seeds of the Lotus, even before they germinate,
          contain perfectly-formed leaves, the miniature shapes of what they
          will become one day, as perfected plants. The Lotus, in India, is
          the symbol of prolific Earth and, what is more, of Mount Meru. The
          four Angels or Genii of the four quarters of Heaven, the Mahârâjahs
          of the Stanzas, stand each on a Lotus. The Lotus is the two-fold
          type of the Divine and Human Hermaphrodite, being so to say, of
          dual sex.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the Hindûs,
          the Spirit of Fire or Heat—which stirs up, fructifies, and develops
          into concrete form, from its ideal prototype, everything which is
          born of Water, or Primordial Earth—evolved Brahmâ. The
          Lotus-flower, represented as growing out of Vishnu's navel, the God
          who rests in the Waters of Space on the Serpent of Infinity, is the
          most graphic symbol ever yet made. It is the Universe evolving from
          the Central Sun, the Point, the ever-concealed Germ. Lakshmî, who
          is the female aspect of Vishnu, and who is also called Padma, the
          Lotus, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Râmâyana</span></span>, is likewise shown
          floating on a Lotus-flower, at the <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation,”</span> and during the <span class="tei tei-q">“Churning of the Ocean”</span> of Space, as also
          springing from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sea of Milk,”</span>
          like Venus-Aphrodite from the Foam of the Ocean.</p>

          Orientalist and poet, Sir Monier Williams.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The underlying
          idea, in this symbol, is very beautiful, and, furthermore, shows an
          identical parentage in all the religious systems. Whether as the
          Lotus or water-lily, it signifies one and the same philosophical
          idea; namely, the Emanation of the Objective from the Subjective,
          Divine Ideation passing from the abstract into the concrete, or
          visible form. For, as soon as Darkness, or rather that which is
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Darkness”</span> for ignorance, has
          disappeared in its own realm of Eternal Light, leaving behind
          itself only its Divine Manifested Ideation, the Creative Logoi have
          their understanding opened, and they see in the Ideal World,
          hitherto concealed in the Divine Thought, the archetypal forms of
          all, and proceed to copy and build, or fashion, upon these models,
          forms evanescent and transcendent.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this stage of
          Action, the Demiurge is not yet the Architect. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg408"></a> Born in the Twilight of Action, he has
          yet to first perceive the Plan, to realize the Ideal Forms, which
          lie buried in the Bosom of Eternal Ideation, just as the future
          lotus-leaves, the immaculate petals, are concealed within the seed
          of that plant.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Esoteric
          Philosophy the Demiurge, or Logos, regarded as the Creator, is
          simply an abstract term, an idea, like the word <span class="tei tei-q">“army.”</span> As the latter is the all-embracing term
          for a body of active forces, or working units—soldiers, so is the
          Demiurge the qualitative compound of a multitude of Creators or
          Builders. Burnouf, the great Orientalist, seized the idea
          perfectly, when he said that Brahmâ does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
          create the Earth, any more than the rest of the Universe.</p>

          emanates, all Nature out of himself. He does not stand above it,
          but is mixed up with it; Brahmâ and the Universe form one Being,
          each particle of which is in its essence Brahmâ himself, who
          proceeded out of himself.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a chapter of
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The lotus-idea
          may be traced even in the Elohistic first chapter of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, as stated in
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span>. It is to this idea that we must look for
          the origin and explanation of the verse in the Jewish Cosmogony
          which reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“And God said, Let the earth
          bring forth ... the fruit-tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose
          seed is in itself.”</span><a href="#note_614" id="noteref_614" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a> In
          all the primitive religions, the Creative God is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of the Father,”</span> that is to say, his Thought
          made visible; and before the Christian era, from the Trimûrti of
          the Hindûs down to the three Kabalistic Heads of the scriptures, as
          explained by the Jews, the Triune Godhead of each nation was fully
          defined and substantiated, in its allegories.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
          cosmic and ideal significance of this great symbol with the Eastern
          peoples. But when applied to practical and exoteric worship, which
          had also its esoteric symbology, the Lotus, in time, became the
          carrier and container of a more terrestrial idea. No dogmatic
          religion has ever escaped having the sexual element in it; and to
          this day it soils the moral beauty of the root idea of symbology.
          The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg 409]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg409"></a> following is quoted
          from the same Kabalistic MS. which we have already cited on several
          occasions:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Pointing to like signification was the Lotus
          growing in the waters of the Nile. Its mode of growth peculiarly
          fitted it as a symbol of the generative activities. The flower of
          the Lotus, which is the bearer of the seed for reproduction, as the
          result of its maturing, is connected by its placenta-like
          attachment to mother-earth, or the womb of Isis, through the water
          of the womb, that is, the river Nile, by the long cord-like stalk,
          the umbilicus. Nothing can be plainer than the symbol, and to make
          it perfect in its intended signification, a child is sometimes
          represented as seated in or issuing from the flower.</span><a href="#note_615" id="noteref_615" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a>

          Cronus, or time without end, in the development of their
          nature-forces, in this picture become the parents of man under the
          name Horus.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">We cannot lay too great stress upon the use of
            this generative function as a basis for a symbolical language,
            and a scientific art-speech. Thought upon the idea leads at once
            to reflection upon the subject of creative cause. In its workings
            Nature is observed to have fashioned a wonderful piece of living
            mechanism, governed by an added living soul; the life development
            and history of which soul, as to its whence, its present, and its
            whither, surpass all efforts of the human intellect.</span><a href="#note_616" id="noteref_616" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">616</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">The new-born is an ever-recurring
            miracle, an evidence that within the workshop of the womb an
            intelligent creative power has intervened to fasten a living soul
            to a physical machine. The amazing wonderfulness of the fact
            attaches a holy sacredness to all connected with the organs of
            reproduction, as the dwelling and place of evident constructive
            intervention of deity.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a
          correct rendering of the underlying ideas of old, of the purely
          pantheistic conceptions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impersonal</span></em> and reverential, of the
          archaic philosophers of the prehistoric ages. It is not so,
          however, when applied to sinful humanity, to the gross ideas
          attached to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personality</span></em>. Therefore, no
          pantheistic philosopher would fail to find the remarks that follow
          the above, and which represent the anthropomorphism of Judean
          symbology, other than dangerous for the sacredness of true
          religion, and fitting only for our materialistic age, which is the

          <span class="tei tei-q">“carried to the extreme,”</span> ever
          existed among the old primitive Âryans. This is proven by the fact
          that, in the Vedic period, their women were not placed apart from
          men in <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">penetralia</span></span>, or Zenanas. This
          seclusion began when the Mahommedans—the next heirs to Hebrew
          symbolism, after Christian ecclesiasticism—had conquered the land
          and gradually enforced their ways and customs upon the Hindûs. The
          pre- and post-Vedic woman was as free as man; and no impure
          terrestrial thought was ever mixed with the religious symbology of
          the early Âryans. The idea and application are purely Semitic. This
          is corroborated by the writer of the said intensely learned and
          Kabalistic revelation, when he closes the above-quoted passages by
          adding:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">If to these organs as symbols of creative cosmic
          agencies the idea of the origin of measures as well as of
          time-periods can be attached, then indeed, in the constructions of
          the Temples as Dwellings of Deity, or of Jehovah, that part
          designated as the Holy of Holies, or the Most Holy Place, should
          borrow its title from the recognized sacredness of the generative
          organs, considered as symbols of measures as well as of creative
          cause. With the ancient</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">wise,
            there was no name, and no idea, and no symbol</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">of a First Cause.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most decidedly
          not. Rather never give a thought to it and leave it for ever
          nameless, as the early Pantheists did, than degrade the sacredness
          of that Ideal of Ideals, by dragging down its symbols into such
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg411"></a> anthropomorphic
          forms! Here again one perceives the immense chasm between Âryan and
          Semitic religious thought, the two opposite poles, Sincerity and
          Concealment. With the Brâhmans, who have never invested the natural
          procreative functions of mankind with an <span class="tei tei-q">“original sin”</span> element, it is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">religious
          duty</span></em> to have a son. A Brâhman, in days of old, having
          accomplished his mission of human creator, retired to the jungle,
          and passed the rest of his days in religious meditation. He had
          accomplished his duty to nature, as mortal man and its co-worker,
          and henceforth gave all his thoughts to the spiritual and immortal
          portion of himself, regarding the terrestrial as a mere illusion,
          an evanescent dream—which, indeed it is. With the Semite, it was
          different. He invented a temptation of flesh in a garden of Eden,
          and showed his God—esoterically, the Tempter and the Ruler of
          Nature—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cursing for ever</span></em> an act, which was
          in the logical programme of that Nature.<a href="#note_619" id="noteref_619" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">619</span></span></a> All
          this exoterically, as in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cloak</span></em> and dead-letter of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span> and the rest. At the
          same time, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">esoterically</span></em>, he regarded the
          supposed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fall</span></em> as
          an act so sacred, as to choose the organ, the perpetrator of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">original
          sin</span></em>, as the fittest and most sacred symbol to represent
          that God, who is shown as branding its entering into function as
          disobedience and everlasting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sin!</span></em></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who can ever
          fathom the paradoxical depths of the Semitic mind! And this
          paradoxical element, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minus</span></em> its innermost significance,
          has now passed entirely into Christian theology and dogma!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
          early Fathers of the Church knew the esoteric meaning of the Hebrew
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Testament</span></span>, or whether only a few
          of them were aware of it, while the others remained ignorant of the
          secret, is for posterity to decide. One thing, at any rate, is
          certain. As the Esotericism of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New
          Testament</span></span> agrees perfectly with that of the Hebrew
          Mosaic Books; and since, at the same time, a number of purely
          Egyptian symbols and Pagan dogmas in general—the Trinity, for
          example—have been copied by, and incorporated into, the Synoptics
          and St. John, it becomes evident that the identity of those symbols
          was known to the writers of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New
          Testament</span></span>, whoever they may have been. They must have
          been also aware of the priority of the Egyptian Esotericism, since
          they have adopted several symbols which typify purely Egyptian
          conceptions and beliefs, in their outward and inward meaning, and
          which are not to be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg
          412]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg412"></a>
          found in the Jewish Canon. One of these is the water-lily in the
          hands of the Archangel, in the early representations of his
          appearance to the Virgin Mary; and these symbolical images are
          preserved to this day in the iconography of the Greek and Roman
          Churches. Thus Water, Fire and the Cross, as well as the Dove, the
          Lamb and other Sacred Animals, with all their combinations,
          esoterically yield an identical meaning, and must have been
          accepted as an improvement upon Judaism pure and simple.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the Lotus
          and Water are among the oldest symbols, and in their origin are
          purely Âryan, though they became common property during the
          branching off of the Fifth Race. To give an example; letters, as
          well as numbers, were all mystic, whether in combination, or taken
          separately. The most sacred of all is the letter M. It is both
          feminine and masculine, or androgyne, and is made to symbolize
          Water in its origin, the Great Deep. It is a mystic letter in all
          languages, Eastern and Western, and stands as a glyph for the
          waves, thus [three triangles]. In the Âryan Esotericism, as in the
          Semitic, this letter has always stood for the Waters. In Sanskrit,
          for instance, Makara, the tenth sign of the Zodiac, means a
          Crocodile, or rather an aquatic monster associated always with
          Water. The letter Ma is equivalent to, and corresponds with, the
          number 5, which is composed of a Binary, the symbol of the two
          sexes separated, and of the Ternary, the symbol of the Third Life,
          the progeny of the Binary. This, again, is often symbolized by a
          Pentagon, the latter being a sacred sign, a divine Monogram.
          Maitreya is the secret name of the Fifth Buddha, and the Kalkî
          Avatâra of the Brâhmans, the last Messiah who will come at the
          culmination of the Great Cycle. It is also the initial letter of
          the Greek Metis, or Divine Wisdom; of Mimra, the Word, or Logos;
          and of Mithras, the Mihr, the Monad Mystery. All these are born in,
          and from, the Great Deep, and are the Sons of Mâyâ, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother”</span>; in Egypt, Moot; in Greece,
          Minerva, Divine Wisdom; of Mary, or Miriam, Myrrha, etc., the
          Mother of the Christian Logos; and of Mâyâ, the Mother of Buddha.
          Mâdhava and Mâdhavî are the titles of the most important Gods and
          Goddesses of the Hindû Pantheon. Finally, Mandala is, in Sanskrit,
          a <span class="tei tei-q">“Circle,”</span> or an Orb, also the ten
          divisions of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>. The most sacred names
          in India generally begin with this letter, from Mahat, the first
          manifested Intellect, and Mandara, the great mountain used by the
          Gods to churn the Ocean, down to Mandâkinî, the heavenly Gangâ, or
          Ganges, Manu, etc., etc.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg 413]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg413"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Will this be
          called a coincidence? A strange one is it then, indeed, when we see
          even Moses, found in the Water of the Nile, with the symbolical
          consonant in his name. And Pharaoh's daughter <span class="tei tei-q">“called his name Moses; and she said, Because I drew
          him out of the Water.”</span><a href="#note_620" id="noteref_620" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a>
          Besides which, the Hebrew sacred name of God, applied to this
          letter M, is Meborach, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Holy”</span> or
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Blessed,”</span> and the name for the
          Water of the Flood is Mbul. A reminder of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Three Maries”</span> at the Crucifixion, and their
          connection with Mare, the Sea, or Water, may close these examples.
          This is why, in Judaism and Christianity, the Messiah is always
          connected with Water, Baptism; and also with the Fishes, the sign
          of the Zodiac called Mînam in Sanskrit, and even with the Matsya
          (Fish) Avatâra, and the Lotus, the symbol of the womb, or with the
          water-lily, which has the same signification.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the relics of
          ancient Egypt, the greater the antiquity of the votive symbols and
          emblems of the objects exhumed, the oftener are Lotus-flowers and
          Water found in connection with the Solar Gods. The God Khnoom, the
          Moist Power, or Water, as Thales taught, being the principle of all
          things, sits on a throne enshrined in a Lotus. The God Bes stands
          on a Lotus, ready to devour his progeny. Thot, the God of Mystery
          and Wisdom, the sacred Scribe of Amenti, wearing the solar disk as
          head gear, sits with a bull's head—the sacred bull of Mendes being
          a form of Thot—and a human body, on a full blown Lotus. Finally, it
          is the Goddess Hiqit, under her shape of a frog, who rests on the
          Lotus, thus showing her connection with water. And it is from the
          unpoetical shape of this frog-symbol, undeniably the glyph of the
          most ancient of the Egyptian Deities, that the Egyptologists have
          been vainly trying to unravel the mystery and functions of the
          Goddess. Its adoption in the Church, by the early Christians, shows
          that they knew it better than our modern Orientalists. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“frog or toad Goddess”</span> was one of
          the chief Cosmic Deities connected with Creation, on account of
          this animal's amphibious nature, and chiefly because of its
          apparent resurrection, after long ages of solitary life, enshrined
          in old walls, in rocks, etc. She not only participated in the
          organization of the World, together with Khnoom, but was also
          connected with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the dogma of resurrection</span></em>.<a href="#note_621" id="noteref_621" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">621</span></span></a> There
          must have been some very profound and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg 414]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg414"></a> sacred meaning attached to this symbol,
          since, notwithstanding the risk of being charged with a disgusting
          form of zoölatry, the early Egyptian Christians adopted it in their
          Churches. A frog or toad, enshrined in a Lotus-flower, or simply
          without the latter emblem, was the form chosen for the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Church-lamps</span></span>, on which were
          engraved the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ἐγώ εἰμι

          frog-Goddesses are also found on all the mummies.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This archaic
          symbol is the most poetical of all symbols, as also the most
          philosophical. The ancient Greeks brought it into prominence, and
          the modern poets have worn it threadbare. The Queen of Night,
          riding in the majesty of her peerless light in Heaven, throwing
          all, even Hesperus, into darkness, and spreading her silver mantle
          over the whole Sidereal World, has ever been a favourite theme with
          all the poets of Christendom, from Milton and Shakespeare down to
          the latest versifier. But the refulgent lamp of night, with her
          suite of stars unnumbered, spoke only to the imagination of the
          profane. Until lately, Religion and Science had nought to do with
          the beautiful mythos. Yet, the cold chaste Moon, she, who, in the
          words of Shelley:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">stands in closer
          relations to Earth than any other sidereal orb. The Sun is the
          Giver of Life to the whole Planetary System; the Moon is the Giver
          of Life to our Globe; and the early races understood and knew it,
          even in their infancy. She is the Queen, and she is the King. She
          was King Soma before she became transformed into Phœbe and the
          chaste Diana. She is preëminently the Deity of the Christians,
          through the Mosaic and Kabalistic Jews, though the civilized world
          may have remained ignorant of the fact for long ages; in fact, ever
          since the last initiated Father of the Church died, carrying with
          him into his grave the secrets of the Pagan Temples. For such
          Fathers as Origen or Clemens Alexandrinus, the Moon was Jehovah's
          living symbol; the Giver of Life and the Giver of Death, the
          Disposer of Being—in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> World. For, if Artemis was
          Luna in Heaven, and, with the Greeks, Diana on Earth, who presided
          over child-birth and life; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg416"></a> with the Egyptians, she was Hekat (Hecate) in
          Hell, the Goddess of Death, who ruled over magic and enchantments.
          More than this; as the personified Moon, whose phenomena are
          triadic, Diana-Hecate-Luna is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three in
          one</span></em>. For she is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Diva
          triformis</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tergemina</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">triceps</span></span>, three heads on one

          Brahmâ-Vishnu-Shiva. Hence she is the prototype of our Trinity,
          which has not always been entirely male. The number seven, so
          prominent in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, so sacred in the seventh
          day, or Sabbath, came to the Jews from antiquity, deriving its
          origin from the four-fold number 7 contained in the 28 days of the
          lunar month, each septenary portion thereof being typified by one
          quarter of the Moon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is worth the
          trouble of presenting, in this work, a bird's-eye view of the
          origin and development of the lunar myth and worship, in historical
          antiquity, on our side of the globe. Its earlier origin is
          untraceable by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exact</span></em> Science, which rejects all
          tradition; while for Theology, which, under the guidance of the
          crafty Popes, has put a brand on every fragment of literature that
          does not bear the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">imprimatur</span></span> of the Church of
          Rome, its archaic history is a sealed book. Whether the Egyptian or
          the Âryan Hindû religious philosophy is the more ancient—the Secret
          Doctrine says it is the latter—does not much matter, in this
          instance, as the Lunar and Solar <span class="tei tei-q">“worship”</span> are the most ancient in the world.
          Both have survived, and prevail to this day throughout the whole
          world; with some openly, with others—as, for instance, in Christian
          symbology—secretly. The cat, a lunar symbol, was sacred to Isis,
          who was the Moon in one sense, just as Osiris was the Sun, and is
          often seen on the top of the Sistrum in the hand of the Goddess.
          This animal was held in great veneration in the city of Bubastis,
          which went into deep mourning on the death of the sacred cats,
          because Isis, as the Moon, was particularly worshipped in that city
          of mysteries. The astronomical symbolism connected with it has
          already been given in Section I, and no one has better described it
          than Mr. Gerald Massey, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lectures</span></span>
          and in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Natural Genesis</span></span>. The eye of
          the cat, it is said, seems to follow the lunar phases in their
          growth and decline, and its orbs shine like two stars in the
          darkness of night. Hence the mythological allegory which shows
          Diana hiding in the Moon, under the shape of a cat, when she was
          seeking, in company with other Deities, to escape the pursuit of
          Typhon, as related in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page417">[pg

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Metamorphoses</span></span> of Ovid. The Moon,

          Osiris,”</span> the Sun.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page420">[pg 420]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg420"></a> The key that opens
          the mystery of Theogony, or the evolution of the manvantaric Gods,
          is more complicated, and has nothing phallic in it. There, all is
          mystical and divine. But the Jews, beyond connecting Jehovah
          directly with the Moon as a generative God, preferred to ignore the
          higher Hierarchies, and have made their Patriarchs of some of these
          zodiacal constellations and planetary Gods, thus euhemerizing the
          purely theosophical idea and dragging it down to the level of
          sinful humanity. The MS., from which the above is extracted,
          explains very clearly to what Hierarchy of Gods Jehovah belonged,
          and who this Jewish God was; for it shows, in clear language, that
          which the writer has always insisted upon, namely, that the God
          with which the Christians have burdened themselves, was no better
          than the lunar symbol of the reproductive or generative faculty in
          Nature. They have ever ignored even the Hebrew secret God of the
          Kabalists, Ain Suph, a conception as grand as Parabrahman in the
          earliest Kabalistic and mystical ideas. But it is not the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> of Rosenroth that can
          ever give the true original teachings of Shimeon Ben Yochaï, which
          were as metaphysical and philosophical as any could be. And how
          many are there among the students of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span>
          who know anything of them except in their distorted Latin

          of Deity, or of Jehovah, that part designated as the Holy of

            geometrically, all plane shapes. So in Kabalah this circle, with
            its diameter line, is the picture of the 10 Sephiroth, or

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This

          of the idea carried from the highest or spiritual down to the
          lowest or terrestrial plane; and limited by the Jews to the latter.
          With them, therefore, the number seven has acquired the most
          prominent place in their exoteric religion, a cult of external
          forms and empty rituals; take, for instance, their Sabbath, the
          seventh day sacred to their Deity, the Moon, symbolical of the
          generative Jehovah. But, with other nations, the number seven was
          typical of theogonic evolution, of Cycles, Cosmic Planes, and the
          Seven Forces and Occult Powers in Kosmos, as a Boundless Whole,
          whose first upper Triangle was unreachable to the finite intellect
          of man. While other nations, therefore, busied themselves, in their
          forcible limitation of Kosmos in Space and Time, only with its
          septenary manifested plane, the Jews centred this number solely in
          the Moon, and based all their sacred calculations thereupon. Hence
          we find the thoughtful author of the MS. just quoted, remarking, in
          reference to the metrology of the Jews, that:</p>

          Power, the Thalatth of Berosus, who presides over the Chaos, and
          was made out later by Christian Theology to be the Serpent and the
          Devil. She-He (Yah-hovah) is the supernal Hé, and Eve. This
          Yah-hovah then, or Jehovah, is identical with our Chaos—Father,
          Mother, Son—on the material plane, and in the purely physical
          World; Deus and Demon, at one and the same time; the Sun and Moon,
          Good and Evil, God and Demon.</p>

          after the position of certain planets, those which the Greeks
          called στοιχεῖα, and according to figures that were located in the
          sky, and called ἀλεξητήριοι, or the Tutelary Gods. Those who traced

          Papists, and can be stoutly denied by the Protestants only at their
          own risk and peril. Two instances may be given.</p>

          including the Sun, was more complex in its manifold meanings than
          the lunar symbol. The sex was, of course, dual. With some it was
          male; as, for instance, the Hindû <span class="tei tei-q">“King
          Soma,”</span> and the Chaldean Sin; with other nations it was
          female, the beauteous Goddesses Diana-Luna, Ilithyia, Lucina. With
          the Tauri, human victims were sacrificed to Artemis, a form of the
          lunar Goddess; the Cretans called her Dictynna, and the Medes and
          Persians Anaïtis, as shown by an inscription of Colœ: Ἀρτέμιδι

          pure of the virgin Goddesses, Luna-Artemis, to whom Pamphôs was the
          first to give the surname of Καλλίστη, and of whom Hippolytus

          Orphic Deity, the predecessor of the God of the Rabbins and
          pre-Christian Kabalists, and his lunar type. The Goddess Τρίμορφος
          was the personified symbol of the various and successive aspects
          represented by the Moon in each of her three phases; and this

          the Orpheans explained the epithet Τρίμορφος by the three kingdoms
          of Nature over which she reigned. Jealous, bloodthirsty, revengeful
          and exacting, Hecate-Luna is a worthy counterpart of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The whole riddle
          of the Solar and Lunar worship, as now traced in the churches,
          hangs indeed on this world-old mystery of lunar phenomena. The
          correlative forces in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen of
          Night,”</span> that lie latent for Modern Science, but are fully
          active to the knowledge of Eastern Adepts, explain well the
          thousand and one images under which the Moon was represented by the
          Ancients. It also shows how much more profoundly learned in the
          Selenic Mysteries were the Ancients than are now our modern
          Astronomers. The whole Pantheon of the lunar Gods and Goddesses,
          Nephtys or Neïth, Proserpina, Melitta, Cybele, Isis, Astarte,
          Venus, and Hecate, on the one hand, and Apollo, Dionysus, Adonis,
          Bacchus, Osiris, Atys, Thammuz, etc., on the other, all show on the
          face of their names and titles—those of <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Husbands”</span> of their <span class="tei tei-q">“Mothers”</span>—their identity with the Christian
          Trinity. In every religious system, the Gods were made to merge
          their functions, as Father, Son, and Husband, into one, and the
          Goddesses were identified as Wife, Mother, and Sister of the male
          God; the former synthesizing the human attributes as the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg426"></a> Giver of Life,”</span> the latter merging all
          the other titles in the grand synthesis known as Maia, Maya, Maria,
          etc., a generic name. Maia, in its forced derivation, has come to
          mean with the Greeks, <span class="tei tei-q">“mother,”</span> from
          the root <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ma</span></span> (nurse), and even gave its
          name to the month of May, which was sacred to all these Goddesses
          before it became consecrated to Mary.<a href="#note_638" id="noteref_638" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">638</span></span></a> Its
          primitive meaning, however, was Mâyâ, Durgâ, translated by the
          Orientalists as <span class="tei tei-q">“inaccessible,”</span> but
          meaning in truth the <span class="tei tei-q">“unreachable,”</span>
          in the sense of illusion and unreality, as being the source and
          cause of spells, the personification of illusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In religious
          rites, the Moon served a dual purpose. Personified as a female
          Goddess for exoteric purposes, or as a male God in allegory and
          symbol, in Occult Philosophy our satellite was regarded as a
          sexless Potency to be well studied, because it was to be dreaded.
          With the initiated Âryans, Chaldeans, Greeks and Romans, Soma, Sin,
          Artemis Soteira (the hermaphrodite Apollo, whose attribute is the
          lyre, and the bearded Diana of the bow and arrow), Deus Lunus, and
          especially Osiris-Lunus and Thot-Lunus,<a href="#note_639" id="noteref_639" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">639</span></span></a> were
          the Occult potencies of the Moon. But whether male or female,
          whether Thot or Minerva, Soma or Astoreth, the Moon is the Occult
          Mystery of Mysteries, and more a symbol of evil than of good. Her
          seven phases, in the original Esoteric division, are divided into
          three astronomical phenomena and four purely psychic phases. That
          the Moon was not always reverenced is shown in the Mysteries, in
          which the death of the Moon-God—the three phases of gradual waning
          and final disappearance—was allegorized by the Moon standing for
          the Genius of Evil that, for the time, triumphs over the Light and
          Life-giving God, the Sun; and all the skill and learning of the
          ancient Hierophants in Magic were required to turn this triumph
          into a defeat.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the most
          ancient worship of all, that of the Third Race of our Round, the
          Hermaphrodites, in which the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">male</span></em> Moon became sacred, when,
          after the so-called Fall, the sexes had become separated. Deus
          Lunus then became an androgyne, male and female in turn; to finally
          serve, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for purposes of sorcery</span></em>, as a dual
          power for the Fourth Root Race, the Atlanteans. With the Fifth, our
          own Race, the Lunar-solar worship divided the nations into two
          distinct, antagonistic camps. It led to events described æons later
          in the Mahâbhâratan War, which to the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg427"></a> Europeans is the fabulous, to the Hindûs and
          Occultists the historical, strife between the Sûryavanshas and the
          Indovanshas. Originating in the dual aspect of the Moon, the
          worship of the female and the male principles respectively, it
          ended in distinct Solar and Lunar cults. Among the Semitic races,
          the Sun was for a very long time feminine and the Moon masculine;
          the latter notion being adopted by them from the Atlantean
          traditions. The Moon was called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord
          of the Sun,”</span> Bel-Shemesh, before the Shemesh worship. The
          ignorance of the incipient reasons for such a distinction, and of
          Occult principles, led the nations into anthropomorphic
          idol-worship. During that period which is absent from the Mosaic
          books, viz., from the exile from Eden to the allegorical Flood, the
          Jews, with the rest of the Semites, worshipped Dayanisi, דינאישי,
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Ruler of Men,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge,”</span> or the Sun. Though the Jewish canon and
          Christianism have made the Sun to become the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord God”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Jehovah”</span> in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>,
          yet the same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> is full of indiscreet
          traces of the androgyne Deity, which was Jehovah, the Sun, and
          Astoreth, the Moon in its female aspect, and quite free from the
          present metaphorical element given to it. God is a <span class="tei tei-q">“consuming fire,”</span> appears <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“is encompassed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by</span></em>
          fire.”</span> It was not only in vision that Ezekiel saw the Jews
          <span class="tei tei-q">“worshipping the Sun.”</span><a href="#note_640" id="noteref_640" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> The
          Baal of the Israelites—the Shemesh of the Moabites and the Moloch
          of the Ammonites—was the identical <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun-Jehovah,”</span> and he is till now the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“King of the Host of Heaven,”</span> the
          Sun, as much as Astoreth was the <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen of
          Heaven,”</span> or the Moon. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun of
          Righteousness”</span> has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only now</span></em> become a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">metaphorical</span></em> expression. But the
          religion of every ancient nation had been primarily based upon the
          Occult manifestations of a purely abstract Force or Principle now
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“God.”</span> The very establishment
          of such worship shows, in its details and rites, that the
          philosophers who evolved such systems of Nature, subjective and
          objective, possessed profound knowledge, and were acquainted with
          many facts of a scientific nature. For besides being purely Occult,
          the rites of Lunar worship were based, as just shown, upon a
          knowledge of Physiology—quite a modern science with us—Psychology,
          sacred Mathematics, Geometry and Metrology, in their right
          applications to symbols and figures, which are but glyphs recording
          observed natural and scientific <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em>;
          in short upon a most minute and profound knowledge of Nature. As we
          have just said, lunar magnetism generates life, preserves and
          destroys it; and Soma embodies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg428"></a> the triple power of the Trimûrti, though it
          remains unrecognized by the profane to this day. The allegory that
          makes Soma, the Moon, produced by the Churning of the Ocean of Life
          (Space) by the Gods in another Manvantara, that is, in the
          pre-genetic day of our Planetary System, and the myth, which
          represents <span class="tei tei-q">“the Rishis milking the Earth,
          whose calf was Soma, the Moon,”</span> have a deep cosmographical
          meaning; for it is neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> Earth which is milked, nor was
          the Moon which we know the calf.<a href="#note_641" id="noteref_641" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a> Had
          our wise men of Science known as much of the mysteries of Nature as
          the ancient Âryans did, they would surely never have imagined that
          the Moon was projected from the Earth. Once more, the oldest of
          permutations in Theogony, the Son becoming his own Father and the
          Mother generated by the Son, has to be remembered and taken into
          consideration if the symbolical language of the Ancients is to be
          understood by us. Otherwise mythology will be ever haunting the
          Orientalists as simply <span class="tei tei-q">“the disease which
          springs up at a peculiar stage of human culture!”</span>—as Renouf
          gravely observes.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ancients
          taught the auto-generation, so to speak, of the Gods: the One
          Divine Essence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unmanifested</span></em>, perpetually
          begetting a Second-Self, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifested</span></em>, which Second-Self,
          androgynous in its nature, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gives birth, in an immaculate way</span></em>,
          to everything macrocosmical and microcosmical in this Universe.
          This was shown in the Circle and the Diameter, or the Sacred Ten
          (10), a few pages back.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But our
          Orientalists, notwithstanding their extreme desire to discover one
          homogeneous Element in Nature, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">will
          not</span></em> see it. Cramped in their researches by such
          ignorance, the Âryanists and Egyptologists are constantly led
          astray from truth in their speculations. Thus, de Rougé is unable
          to understand, in the text which he translates, the meaning of
          Ammon-Ra saying to King Amenophes, who is supposed to be Memnon:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art my Son, I have begotten
          thee.”</span> And, finding the same idea in many a text and under
          various forms, this very Christian Orientalist is finally compelled
          to exclaim:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">For this idea to have entered the mind of a
          hierogrammatist, there must have been in their religion a more or
          less defined doctrine,</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">indicating
            as a possible fact that might come to pass, a divine and
            immaculate incarnation under a human form.</span></span></p>
</div><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page429">[pg 429]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg429"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Precisely. But
          why throw the explanation on to an impossible prophecy, when the
          whole secret is explained by the later religion copying the
          earlier?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This doctrine
          was universal, nor was it the mind of any one hierogrammatist that
          evolved it; for the Indian Avatâras are a proof to the contrary.
          After which, having come <span class="tei tei-q">“to realize more
          clearly”</span><a href="#note_642" id="noteref_642" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a> what
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine Father and Son”</span> were
          with the Egyptians, de Rougé still fails to account for, and to
          perceive what were the functions attributed to, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feminine</span></em> Principle in that
          primordial generation. He does not find it in the Goddess Neïth, of
          Saïs. Yet he quotes the sentence of the Commander to Cambyses, when
          introducing that king into the Saïtic temple: <span class="tei tei-q">“I made known to his Majesty the dignity of Saïs, which
          is the abode of Neïth, the great [female] producer, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genitrix of the
          Sun</span></em>, who is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">first-born, and who is not begotten, but only
          brought forth</span></span>”</span>—and hence is the fruit of an
          Immaculate Mother.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How much more
          grandiose, philosophical and poetical—for whoever is able to
          understand and appreciate it—is the real distinction made between
          the Immaculate Virgin of the ancient Pagans and the modern Papal
          conception. With the former, the ever-youthful Mother Nature, the
          antitype of her prototypes, the Sun and Moon, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generates</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">brings
          forth</span></em> her <span class="tei tei-q">“mind-born”</span>
          Son, the Universe. The Sun and Moon, as male-female deities,
          fructify the Earth, the microcosmical Mother, and the latter
          conceives and brings forth, in her turn. With the Christians, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“First-born”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primogenitus</span></span>) is indeed
          generated, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, begotten (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">genitus, non
          factus</span></span>), and positively <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conceived and
          brought forth</span></em>: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Virgo
          pariet</span></span>,”</span> explains the Latin Church. Thus does
          that Church drag down the noble spiritual ideal of the Virgin Mary
          to the earth, and, making her <span class="tei tei-q">“of the earth
          earthy,”</span> degrades the ideal she portrays to the lowest of
          the anthropomorphic Goddesses of the rabble.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truly, Neïth,
          Isis, Diana, etc., by whatever name she was called, was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a demiurgical Goddess, at once visible and
          invisible, having her place in Heaven, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">helping on the
          generation of species</span></em>”</span>—the Moon, in short. Her
          occult aspects and powers are numberless, and, in one of them, the
          Moon becomes with the Egyptians Hathor, another aspect of
          Isis,<a href="#note_643" id="noteref_643" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> and
          both of these Goddesses are shown suckling Horus. Behold in the
          Egyptian Hall of the British Museum, Hathor worshipped by Pharaoh
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg430"></a> Thotmes, who stands
          between her and the Lord of Heavens. The monolith was taken from
          Karnac. The same Goddess has the following legend inscribed on her
          throne: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Divine Mother and
          Lady, or Queen of Heaven</span></span>”</span>; also the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Morning Star</span></span>,”</span> and the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Light of the
          Sea</span></span>”</span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Stella
          Matutina</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Lux
          Maris</span></span>. All the Lunar Goddesses had a dual aspect; one
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em>, the other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">infernal</span></em>. All were the Virgin
          Mothers of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immaculately</span></em> born Son—the Sun.
          Raoul Rochette shows the Moon-Goddess of the Athenians, Pallas, or
          Cybele, Minerva, or again Diana, holding her child-son on her lap,
          invoked in her festivals as Μονογενὴς θεοῦ, the <span class="tei tei-q">“One Mother of God,”</span> sitting on a lion, and
          surrounded by twelve personages; in whom the Occultist recognizes
          the twelve great Gods, and the pious Christian Orientalist the
          Apostles, or rather the Grecian Pagan prophecy thereof.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They are both
          right, for the Immaculate Goddess of the Latin Church is a faithful
          copy of the older Pagan Goddesses; the number of the Apostles is
          that of the twelve Tribes, and the latter are a personification of
          the twelve great Gods, and of the twelve Signs of the Zodiac.
          Almost every detail in the Christian dogma is borrowed from the
          Heathens. Semele, the Wife of Jupiter and Mother of Bacchus, the
          Sun, is, according to Nonnus, also <span class="tei tei-q">“carried,”</span> or made to ascend to Heaven after her
          death, where she presides between Mars and Venus, under the name of
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen of the World,”</span> or the
          Universe, πανβασίλεια; <span class="tei tei-q">“at the name of
          which,”</span> as at the names of Hathor, Hecate, and other
          infernal Goddesses, <span class="tei tei-q">“all the demons
          tremble.”</span><a href="#note_644" id="noteref_644" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a></p>

          by Beger, and copied by Montfaucon, as De Mirville tells us,
          informs us of the stupendous fact, that the Magna Mater of the old
          world was an impudent <span class="tei tei-q">“plagiarism”</span>
          of the Immaculate Virgin Mother of his Church, perpetrated by the
          Demon. Whether so, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vice versâ</span></span>, is of no importance.
          That which is interesting to note is the perfect identity between
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">archaic copy</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">modern

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Did space permit
          we might show the inconceivable coolness and unconcern exhibited by
          certain followers of the Roman Catholic Church, when they are made

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This settles the
          question. According to such writers as De Mirville, the more
          similarity there exists between the Pagan conceptions and the
          Christian dogmas, the more divine appears the Christian religion,
          and the more is it seen to be the only truly inspired one,
          especially in its Roman Catholic form. The unbelieving Scientists
          and Academicians who think they see in the Latin Church quite the
          opposite of divine inspiration, and who will not believe in the
          Satanic tricks of plagiarism by anticipation, are severely taken to
          task. But then <span class="tei tei-q">“they believe in nothing and
          reject even the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nabathean Agriculture</span></span> as a
          romance and a pack of superstitious nonsense,”</span> complains the
          memorialist. <span class="tei tei-q">“In their perverted opinion
          Qû-tâmy's <span class="tei tei-q">‘idol of the Moon’</span> and the
          statue of the Madonna are one!”</span> A noble Marquis, twenty-five
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg432"></a> years ago, wrote six
          huge volumes, or, as he calls them <span class="tei tei-q">“Mémoires to the French Academy,”</span> with the sole
          object of proving Roman Catholicism to be an inspired and revealed
          faith. As a proof thereof, he furnishes numberless facts, all
          tending to show that the entire Ancient World, ever since the
          Deluge, had, with the help of the Devil, been systematically
          plagiarizing the rites, ceremonies, and dogmas of the future Holy
          Church, which was to be born ages later. What would that faithful
          son of Rome have said had he heard his co-religionist, M. Renouf,
          the distinguished Egyptologist of the British Museum, declaring in
          one of his learned lectures, that neither <span class="tei tei-q">“Hebrews nor Greeks borrowed any of their ideas from
          Egypt”</span>?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But perhaps M.
          Renouf intended to say that it was the Egyptians, the Greeks, and
          the Âryans, who borrowed their ideas from the Latin Church? And if
          so, why, in the name of logic, do the Papists reject the additional
          information which the Occultists may give them on Moon-worship,
          since it all tends to show that the worship of the Roman Catholic
          Church is as old as the world—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of Sabæanism and Astrolatry</span></em>?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason of
          early Christian and later Roman Catholic Astrolatry, or the
          symbolical worship of Sun and Moon, a worship identical with that
          of the Gnostics, though less philosophical and pure than the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun-worship”</span> of the Zoroastrians,
          is a natural consequence of its birth and origin. The adoption by
          the Latin Church of such symbols as Water, Fire, Sun, Moon and
          Stars, and many others, is simply a continuation by the early
          Christians of the old worship of Pagan nations. Thus, Odin got his
          wisdom, power, and knowledge, by sitting at the feet of Mimir, the
          thrice-wise Jotun, who passed his life by the fountain of primeval
          Wisdom, the crystalline Waters of which increased his knowledge
          daily. <span class="tei tei-q">“Mimir drew the highest knowledge
          from the fountain, because the World was born of Water; hence
          primeval Wisdom was to be found in that mysterious element.”</span>
          The eye which Odin had to pledge to acquire that knowledge may be
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sun, which enlightens and penetrates
          all things; his other eye being the Moon, whose reflection gazes
          out of the deep, and which at last, when setting, sinks into the
          Ocean.”</span><a href="#note_650" id="noteref_650" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a> But
          it is something more than this. Loki, the Fire-God, is said to have
          hidden in the Water, as well as in the Moon, the light-giver, whose
          reflection he found therein. This belief that the Fire finds refuge
          in the Water was not limited to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg433"></a> the old Scandinavians. It was shared by all
          nations and was finally adopted by the early Christians, who
          symbolized the Holy Ghost under the shape of Fire, <span class="tei tei-q">“cloven tongues like as of fire”</span>—the breath of
          the Father-Sun. This Fire descends also into the Water, or the
          Sea—Mare, Mary. The Dove was the symbol of the Soul with several
          nations; it was sacred to Venus, the Goddess born from the
          sea-foam, and it became later the symbol of the Christian Anima
          Mundi, or Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
          occult chapters in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of the Dead</span></span> is that
          entitled, <span class="tei tei-q">“The transformation into the God
          giving Light to the Path of Darkness,”</span> wherein <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman-Light of the Shadow”</span> serves Thot in his
          retreat in the Moon. Thot-Hermes is said to hide therein, because
          he is the representative of the Secret Wisdom. He is the manifested
          Logos of its light side; the concealed Deity or <span class="tei tei-q">“Dark Wisdom”</span> when he is supposed to retire to
          the opposite hemisphere. Speaking of her power, the Moon calls
          herself repeatedly: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Light which
          shineth in Darkness,”</span> the <span class="tei tei-q">“Woman-Light.”</span> Hence it became the accepted
          symbol of all the Virgin-Mother Goddesses. As the wicked
          <span class="tei tei-q">“evil”</span> Spirits warred against the
          Moon in days of yore, so they are supposed to war now, without,
          however, being able to prevail against the actual Queen of Heaven,
          Mary, the Moon. Hence, also, the Moon was intimately connected in
          all the Pagan Theogonies with the Dragon, her eternal enemy. The
          Virgin, or Madonna, stands on the mythical Satan thus symbolized,
          who lies crushed and powerless, under her feet. This, because the
          head and tail of the Dragon, which, to this day in Eastern
          Astronomy, represent the ascending and descending nodes of the
          Moon, were also symbolized in ancient Greece by the two serpents.
          Hercules kills them on the day of his birth, and so does the Babe
          in his Virgin-Mother's arms. As Mr. Gerald Massey aptly observes in
          this connection:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Ophites
          asserted that there were several kinds of Genii, from God to man;
          that the relative superiority of these was decided by the degree of
          Light that was accorded to each; and they maintained that the
          Serpent had to be constantly called upon and to be thanked for the
          signal service it had rendered humanity. For it taught Adam that if
          he ate of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, he
          would raise his Being immensely by the learning and wisdom he would
          thus acquire. Such was the exoteric reason given.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is easy to
          see whence is the primal idea of the dual, Janus-like character of
          the Serpent—the good and the bad. This symbol is one of the most
          ancient, because the reptile preceded the bird, and the bird the
          mammal. Hence the belief, or rather the superstition, of the savage
          tribes who think that the souls of their ancestors live under this
          form, and the general association of the Serpent with the Tree. The
          legends about the various meanings it represents are numberless;
          but, as most of them are allegorical, they have now passed into the
          class of fables based on ignorance and dark superstition. For
          instance, when Philostratus narrates that the natives of India and
          Arabia fed on the heart and liver of Serpents in order to learn the
          language of all the animals, the Serpent being credited with that
          faculty, he certainly never meant his words to be accepted
          literally.<a href="#note_651" id="noteref_651" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">651</span></span></a> As
          will be found more than once as we proceed, Serpent and Dragon were
          names given <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg
          435]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg435"></a>
          to the Wise Ones, the Initiated Adepts of olden times. It was their
          wisdom and their learning that were devoured or assimilated by
          their followers, whence the allegory. When the Scandinavian Sigurd
          is fabled to have roasted the heart of Fafnir, the Dragon, whom he
          had slain, and thence to have become the wisest of men, the meaning
          is the same. Sigurd had become learned in the runes and magical
          charms; he had received the <span class="tei tei-q">“Word”</span>
          from an Initiate of the name of Fafnir, or from a sorcerer, after
          which the latter died, as do many, after <span class="tei tei-q">“passing the word.”</span> Epiphanius lets out a secret
          of the Gnostics in trying to expose their <span class="tei tei-q">“heresies.”</span> The Gnostic Ophites, he says, had a
          reason for honouring the Serpent: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it was because he
          taught the primeval men the Mysteries</span></em>.<a href="#note_652" id="noteref_652" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a>
          Verily so; but they did not have Adam and Eve in the Garden in
          their minds when teaching this dogma, but simply that which is
          stated above. The Nâgas of the Hindû and Tibetan Adepts were human
          Nâgas (Serpents), not reptiles. Moreover, the Serpent has ever been
          the type of consecutive or serial rejuvenation, of Immortality and
          Time.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The numerous and
          extremely interesting readings, the interpretations and facts about
          Serpent worship, given in Mr. Gerald Massey's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Natural
          Genesis</span></span>, are very ingenious and scientifically
          correct. But they are far from covering the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em>
          of the meanings implied. They divulge only the astronomical and
          physiological mysteries, with the addition of some cosmic
          phenomena. On the lowest plane of materiality, the Serpent was, no
          doubt, the <span class="tei tei-q">“great emblem of Mystery in the
          Mysteries,”</span> and was, very likely, <span class="tei tei-q">“adopted as a type of feminine pubescence, on account
          of its sloughing and self-renewal.”</span> It was so, however, only
          with regard to mysteries concerning terrestrial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animal</span></em>
          life, for as the symbol of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">re-clothing</span></em> and re-birth in the
          [universal] mysteries,”</span> its <span class="tei tei-q">“final
          phase,”</span><a href="#note_653" id="noteref_653" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> or
          shall we rather say its incipient and culminating phases, was not
          of this plane. These phases were generated in the pure realm of
          Ideal Light, and having accomplished the round of the whole cycle
          of adaptations and symbolism, the Mysteries returned from whence
          they had come, into the essence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immaterial</span></em> causality. They
          belonged to the highest Gnôsis. And surely this could have never
          obtained its name and fame solely on account of its penetration
          into physiological and especially feminine functions!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a symbol, the
          Serpent had as many aspects and occult meanings as the Tree itself;
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Tree of Life,”</span> with which it
          was emblematically <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page436">[pg
          436]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg436"></a>
          and almost indissolubly connected. Whether viewed as a metaphysical
          or a physical symbol, the Tree and Serpent, jointly, or separately,
          have never been so degraded by antiquity as they are now, in this
          our age of the breaking of idols, not for truth's sake, but to
          glorify the most gross matter. The revelations and interpretations
          in General Forlong's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rivers of Life</span></span> would have
          astounded the worshippers of the Tree and Serpent in the days of
          archaic Chaldean and Egyptian wisdom; and even the early Shaivas
          would have recoiled in horror at the theories and suggestions of
          the author of the said work. <span class="tei tei-q">“The notion of
          Payne Knight and Inman that the Cross or Tau is simply a copy of
          the male organs in a triadic form is radically false,”</span>
          writes Mr. G. Massey, who proves what he says. But this is a
          statement that could be as justly applied to almost all the modern
          interpretations of ancient symbols. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Natural
          Genesis</span></span>, a monumental work of research and thought,
          the most complete on that subject that has ever been published,
          covering as it does a wider field, and explaining much more than
          all the Symbologists who have hitherto written, does not yet go
          beyond the <span class="tei tei-q">“psycho-theistic”</span> stage
          of ancient thought. Nor were Payne Knight and Inman altogether
          wrong; except in entirely failing to see that their interpretations
          of the Tree of Life, as the Cross and Phallus, fitted the symbol
          only in the lowest and latest stage of the evolutionary development
          of the idea of the Giver of Life. It was the last and the grossest
          physical transformation of Nature, in animal, insect, bird and even
          plant; for bi-une, creative magnetism, in the form of the
          attraction of contraries, or sexual polarization, acts in the
          constitution of reptile and bird as it does in that of man.
          Moreover, the modern Symbologists and Orientalists, from first to
          last, being ignorant of the real Mysteries revealed by Occultism,
          can necessarily see but this last stage. If told that this mode of
          procreation, which the whole world of being has now in common on
          this Earth, is but a passing phase, a physical means of furnishing
          the conditions to and producing the phenomena of life, and that it
          will alter with this and disappear with the next Root-Race, they
          would laugh at such a superstitious and unscientific idea. But the
          most learned Occultists assert this because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they know
          it</span></em>. The universe of living beings, of all those which
          procreate their species, is the living witness to the various modes
          of procreation in the evolution of animal and human species and
          races; and the Naturalist ought to sense this truth intuitionally,
          even though he is yet unable to demonstrate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg 437]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg437"></a> it. How could he, indeed, with the
          present modes of thought! The landmarks of the archaic history of
          the Past are few and scarce, and those that men of Science come
          across are mistaken for finger-posts of our little era. Even
          so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“universal (?) history”</span>
          embraces but a tiny field in the almost boundless space of the
          unexplored regions of our latest, Fifth Root-Race. Hence, every
          fresh sign-post, every new glyph of the hoary Past that is
          discovered, is added to the old stock of information, to be
          interpreted on the same lines of preëxisting conceptions, and
          without any reference to the special cycle of thought which that
          particular glyph may belong to. How can Truth ever come to light if
          this method is never changed!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, in the
          beginning of their joint existence as a glyph of Immortal Being,
          the Tree and Serpent were divine imagery, truly. The Tree was
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reversed</span></em>, and its roots were
          generated in Heaven and grew out of the Rootless Root of All-Being.
          Its trunk grew and developed; crossing the planes of the Plerôma,
          it shot out crossways its luxuriant branches, first on the plane of
          hardly differentiated matter, and then downward till they touched
          the terrestrial plane. Thus, the Ashvattha Tree of Life and Being,
          whose destruction alone leads to immortality, is said in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bhagavadgîtâ</span></span> to grow with its
          roots above and its branches below.<a href="#note_654" id="noteref_654" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a> The
          roots represent the Supreme Being, or First Cause, the Logos; but
          one has to go beyond those roots to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unite oneself with
          Krishna</span></em>, who, says Arjuna, is <span class="tei tei-q">“greater than Brahman, and First Cause ... the
          indestructible, that which is, that which is not, and what is
          beyond them.”</span><a href="#note_655" id="noteref_655" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">655</span></span></a> Its
          boughs are Hiranyagarbha (Brahmâ or Brahman in its highest
          manifestations, say Shrîdhara Svâmin and Madhusûdana), the highest
          Dhyân Chohans or Devas. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> are its leaves. He only
          who goes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond</span></em> the roots shall never
          return; that is to say, shall reïncarnate no more during this Age
          of Brahmâ.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is only when
          its pure boughs had touched the terrestrial mud of the Garden of
          Eden, of our Adamic Race, that this Tree became soiled by the
          contact and lost its pristine purity; and that the Serpent of
          Eternity, the Heaven-Born Logos, was finally degraded. In days of
          old, of the Divine Dynasties on Earth, the now dreaded reptile was
          regarded as the first beam of light that radiated from the abyss of
          Divine Mystery. Various were the forms which it was made to assume,
          and numerous the natural symbols adapted to it, as it crossed the
          æons of Time; as from Infinite Time (Kâla) itself it fell into the
          space and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg
          438]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg438"></a>
          time evolved out of human speculation. These forms were cosmic and
          astronomical, theistic and pantheistic, abstract and concrete. They
          became in turn the Polar Dragon and the Southern Cross, the Alpha
          Draconis of the Pyramid, and the Hindû-Buddhist Dragon, which ever
          threatens, yet never swallows the Sun during its eclipses. Till
          then, the Tree remained ever green, for it was sprinkled by the
          Waters of Life; the Great Dragon remained ever divine, so long as
          it was kept within the precincts of the sidereal fields. But the
          Tree grew and its lower boughs at last touched the Infernal
          Regions—our Earth. Then the Great Serpent Nidhögg—he who devours
          the corpses of the evil-doers in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hall
          of Misery”</span> (human life), so soon as they are plunged into
          Hwergelmir, the roaring cauldron (of human passions)—gnawed the
          reversed World-Tree. The worms of materiality covered the once
          healthy and mighty roots, and are now ascending higher and higher
          along the trunk; while the Midgard Snake coiled at the bottom of
          the Seas, encircles the Earth, and, through its venomous breath,
          makes her powerless to defend herself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dragons and
          Serpents of Antiquity are all seven-headed—one head for each Race,
          and <span class="tei tei-q">“every head with seven hairs on
          it,”</span> as the allegory has it. Aye, from Ananta, the Serpent
          of Eternity, which carries Vishnu through the Manvantara; from the
          original primordial Shesha, whose seven heads become <span class="tei tei-q">“one thousand heads”</span> in the Purânic fancy, down
          to the seven-headed Akkadian Serpent. This typifies the Seven
          Principles throughout Nature and in man; the highest or middle head
          being the seventh. It is not of the Mosaic, Jewish Sabbath that
          Philo speaks, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Creation of the World</span></span>, when

          the house on high, as Wisdom (Sophia) built hers with seven
          pillars.... The primary kronotypes were seven, and thus the
          beginning of time in heaven is based on the number and the name of
          seven, on account of the starry demonstrators. The seven stars as
          they turned round annually kept pointing, as it were, with the
          forefinger of the right hand, and describing a circle in the upper
          and lower heaven.</span><a href="#note_657" id="noteref_657" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">657</span></span></a>

            constellations; the lunar zodiac of twenty-eight signs being the

          further elucidation, however. As already stated, what Mr. Gerald
          Massey calls the Four Genii of the four cardinal points; and the
          Chinese, the Black Warrior, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Azure
          Dragon, are called in the Secret Books, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Four Hidden Dragons of Wisdom”</span> and the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Celestial Nâgas.”</span> Now, the
          seven-headed or septenary Dragon-Logos is shown to have, in course
          of time, been split up, so to speak, into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em>
          heptanomic parts or twenty-eight portions. Each week has a distinct
          Occult character in the lunar month; each day of the twenty-eight
          has its special characteristics; for each of the twelve
          constellations, whether separately or in combination with other
          signs, has an Occult influence either for good or for evil. This
          represents the sum of knowledge that men can acquire on this earth;
          yet few are those who acquire it, and still fewer are the wise men
          who get to the root of knowledge symbolized by the great
          Root-Dragon, the Spiritual Logos of these visible signs. But those
          who do, receive the name of Dragons, and they are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Arhats of the Four Truths of the Twenty-eight

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Crocodile is
          the Egyptian Dragon. It was the dual symbol of Heaven and Earth, of
          Sun and Moon, and was made sacred, in consequence of its amphibious
          nature, to Osiris and Isis. According to Eusebius, the Egyptians
          represented the Sun in a Ship as its pilot, this ship being carried
          along by a Crocodile, <span class="tei tei-q">“to show the motion

          Lower being the more swampy of the two <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg441"></a> countries. The Alchemists claim another
          interpretation. They say that the symbol of the Sun in the Ship on
          the Ether of Space meant that the Hermetic Matter is the principle,
          or basis, of Gold, or again the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">philosophical</span></em> Sun; the Water,
          within which the Crocodile is swimming, is that Water, or Matter,
          made liquid; the Ship herself, finally, representing the Vessel of
          Nature, in which the Sun, or the sulphuric, igneous principle, acts
          as a pilot, because it is the Sun which conducts the work by his
          action upon the Moist or Mercury. The above is only for the

          became the type and symbol of evil, and of the Devil, only during

          Gnostics, had their dual Logos: the Good and the Bad Serpent, the
          Agathodæmon and the Kakodæmon. This is demonstrated by the writings
          of Marcus, Valentinus, and many others, and especially in

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The

          exhibited a curious design which might have represented either Isis

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This symbolical
          sentence, in its many-sided forms, is certainly most dangerous and
          iconoclastic in the face of all the dualistic later religions, or
          rather theologies, and especially so in the light of Christianity.
          Yet it is neither just nor correct to say that it is Christianity
          which has conceived and brought forth Satan. As an <span class="tei tei-q">“Adversary,”</span> the opposing Power required by the
          equilibrium and harmony of things in Nature, as Shadow is required
          to make still brighter the Eight, as Night to bring into greater
          relief the Day, and as Cold to make one appreciate the more the
          comfort of Heat, so has Satan ever existed. Homogeneity is one and
          indivisible. But if the homogeneous One and Absolute is no mere
          figure of speech, and if Heterogeneity, in its dualistic aspect, is
          its offspring, its bifurcous shadow or reflection, then even that
          divine Homogeneity must contain in itself the essence of both good
          and evil. If <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> is Absolute,
          Infinite, and the Universal Root of all and everything in Nature
          and its Universe, whence comes Evil or D'Evil if not from the same
          Golden Womb of the Absolute? Thus we are forced either to accept
          the emanation of good and evil, of Agathodæmon and Kakodæmon, as
          offshoots from the same trunk of the Tree of Being, or to resign
          ourselves to the absurdity of believing in two eternal
          Absolutes!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having to trace
          the origin of the idea to the very beginnings of the human mind, it
          is but just, meanwhile, to give his due even to the proverbial
          Devil. Antiquity knew of no isolated, thoroughly and absolutely bad
          <span class="tei tei-q">“God of evil.”</span> Pagan thought
          represented good and evil as twin brothers, born from the same
          mother—Nature; so soon as that thought ceased to be archaic, Wisdom
          passed into Philosophy. In the beginning the symbols of good and
          evil were mere abstractions, Light and Darkness; later their types
          were chosen among the most natural and ever-recurrent periodical
          cosmic phenomena—the Day and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg444"></a> Night, or the Sun and Moon. Then the Hosts of
          the Solar and Lunar Deities were made to represent them, and the
          Dragon of Darkness was contrasted with the Dragon of Light. The
          Host of Satan is a Son of God, no less than the Host of the B'ne
          Alhim, the Children of God who came to <span class="tei tei-q">“present themselves before the Lord,”</span> their
          Father.<a href="#note_665" id="noteref_665" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a>

          individualized shape, until the creation by man, of a <span class="tei tei-q">“one <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></em> personal God,”</span> had
          been accomplished; and then merely as a matter of prime necessity.
          A screen was needed; a scape-goat to explain the cruelty, blunders,
          and but too-evident injustice, perpetrated by him for whom absolute
          perfection, mercy and goodness were claimed. This was the first
          Karmic effect of abandoning a philosophical and logical Pantheism,
          to build, as a prop for lazy man, <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          merciful Father in Heaven,”</span> whose daily and hourly actions,
          as Natura Naturans, the <span class="tei tei-q">“comely Mother but
          stone cold,”</span> belie the assumption. This led to the primal
          twins, Osiris-Typhon, Ormazd-Ahriman, and finally Cain-Abel and the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tutti quanti</span></span> of contraries.</p>

          and Scripture.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the

          human fancy; afterwards, fashioned into a fiendish, deceiving,
          cunning, and jealous God.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the Dragons
          and other Fallen Angels are described in other parts of this work,
          a few words upon the much-slandered Satan will be sufficient. The
          student will do well to remember that, with every people, except
          the Christian nations, the Devil is to this day no worse an entity
          than the opposite aspect, in the dual nature of the so-called
          Creator. This is only natural. One cannot claim God as the
          synthesis of the whole Universe, as Omnipresent and Omniscient and
          Infinite, and then divorce him from Evil. As there is far more Evil
          than Good in the world, it follows on logical grounds that either
          God must include Evil, or stand as the direct cause of it, or else
          surrender his claims to Absoluteness. The Ancients understood this
          so well that their philosophers, now followed by the Kabalists,
          defined Evil as the <span class="tei tei-q">“lining”</span> of God
          or Good; <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Demon est Deus inversus</span></span>, being a
          very old adage. Indeed, Evil is but an antagonizing blind force in
          Nature; it is reäction, opposition, and contrast—evil for some,
          good for others. There is no <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">malum in
          se</span></span>; only the Shadow of Light, without which Light
          could have no existence, even in our perceptions. If Evil
          disappeared, Good would disappear along with it from Earth. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Old Dragon”</span> was pure Spirit before
          he became Matter, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">passive</span></em> before he became
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em>. In the Syro-Chaldean Magic
          both Ophis and Ophiomorphos are joined in the Zodiac in the sign of
          the Androgyne Virgo-Scorpio. Before its fall on earth the Serpent
          was Ophis-Christos, and after its fall it became
          Ophiomorphos-Chrestos. Everywhere the speculations of the Kabalists
          treat of Evil as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Force</span></em>, which is antagonistic, but
          at the same time essential, to Good, as giving it vitality and
          existence, which it could never have otherwise. There would be no
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Life</span></em> possible (in the mâyâvic
          sense) without <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Death</span></em>; no regeneration and
          reconstruction without destruction. Plants would perish in eternal
          sunlight, and so would man, who would become an automaton without
          the exercise of his free will, and his aspiring towards that
          sunlight, which would lose its being and value for him had he
          nothing but light. Good is infinite and eternal only in the
          eternally concealed from us, and this is why we imagine it eternal.
          On the manifested planes, one equilibrates the other. Few are those
          Theists, believers in a Personal God, who do not make of Satan the
          shadow of God; or who, confounding both, do not believe they have a
          right to pray to their idol, asking its help and protection for the
          exercise of and immunity for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg446"></a> their evil and cruel deeds. <span class="tei tei-q">“Lead us not into temptation”</span> is addressed daily
          to <span class="tei tei-q">“our Father, in Heaven,”</span> and not
          to the Devil, by millions of Christian hearts. This they do,
          repeating the very words put into the mouth of their Saviour, and
          yet do not give one thought to the fact that their meaning is
          contradicted point blank by James, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          brother of the Lord”</span>:</p>

          Archangels, rather than believe that Father and Son are a gigantic,
          personified and eternal Lie, we prefer to turn to Pantheism and to
          Pagan philosophy for information.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once that the
          key to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span> is in our hands, the
          scientific and symbolical Kabalah unveils the secret. The Great
          Serpent of the Garden of Eden and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord
          God”</span> are identical, and so are Jehovah and Cain—that Cain
          who is referred to in Theology as the <span class="tei tei-q">“murderer”</span> and the Liar to God! Jehovah tempts
          the King of Israel to number the people, and Satan tempts him to do
          the same in another place. Jehovah turns into the Fiery Serpents to
          bite those he is displeased with; and Jehovah informs the Brazen
          Serpent that heals them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These short, and
          seemingly contradictory, statements in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old
          Testament</span></span>—contradictory because the two Powers are
          separated instead of being regarded as the two faces of one and the
          same thing—are the echoes, distorted out of recognition by
          exotericism and theology, of the universal and philosophical dogmas
          in Nature, so well understood <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg447"></a> by the primitive Sages. We find the same
          groundwork in several personifications in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, only far more ample and
          philosophically suggestive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus Pulastya, a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God,”</span> one of the first
          progeny, is made the progenitor of Demons, the Râkshasas, the
          tempters and the devourers of men. Pishâchâ, a female Demon, is a
          daughter of Daksha, a <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of God”</span>
          too, and a God, and the mother of all the Pishâchas.<a href="#note_669" id="noteref_669" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">669</span></span></a> The
          Demons, so-called in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, are very extraordinary
          Devils when judged from the standpoint of European and orthodox
          views, since all of them, Dânavas, Daityas, Pishâchas, and
          Râkshasas, are represented as extremely pious, following the
          precepts of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, some of them even being
          great Yogins. But they oppose the clergy and ritualism, sacrifices
          and forms, just as the head Yogins do to this day in India, and are
          no less respected for it, though they are permitted to follow
          neither caste nor ritual; hence all those Purânic Giants and Titans
          are called Devils. The missionaries, ever on the watch to show, if
          they can, that the Hindû traditions are nothing better than a
          reflection of the Jewish <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, have evolved a whole
          romance on the alleged identity of Pulastya with Cain, and of the
          Râkshasas with the Cainites, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Accursed,”</span> the cause of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Noachian”</span> Deluge. (See the work of Abbé
          Gorresio, who <span class="tei tei-q">“etymologizes”</span>
          Pulastya's name as meaning the <span class="tei tei-q">“rejected,”</span> hence Cain, if you please). Pulastya
          dwells in Kedara, he says, which means a <span class="tei tei-q">“dug-up place,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“mine,”</span> and Cain is shown, in tradition and the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, as the first worker in
          metals and a miner thereof!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While it is very
          probable that the Gibborim, or Giants, of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
          are the Râkshasas of the Hindûs, it is still more certain that both
          are Atlanteans, and belong to the submerged races. However it may
          be, no Satan could be more persistent in slandering his enemy, or
          more spiteful in his hatred, than the Christian Theologians are in
          cursing him as the father of every evil. Compare their vituperation
          and their opinions about the Devil with the philosophical views of
          the Purânic Sages and their Christ-like mansuetude. When Parâshara,
          whose father was devoured by a Râkshasa, was preparing himself to
          destroy, by magic arts, the whole race, his grandsire, Vasishtha,
          after showing the irate Sage, on his own confession, that there is
          Evil and Karma, but no <span class="tei tei-q">“evil
          Spirits”</span> speaks the following suggestive words:</p>

          Parâshara prayed for, was the destruction of the Spirits of
          Darkness, for his personal revenge. He is called a Pagan, and the
          Christians have doomed him, as such, to Eternal Hell. Yet, in what
          respect is the prayer of sovereigns and generals, who pray before
          every battle for the destruction of their enemy, any better? Such a
          prayer is in every case Black Magic of the worst kind, concealed
          like a demon <span class="tei tei-q">“Mr. Hyde”</span> under a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In human nature,

          Cosmos, the equilibrium must be preserved. The operations of the
          two contraries produce harmony, like the centripetal and
          centrifugal forces, which, being mutually inter-dependent, are
          necessary to each other, <span class="tei tei-q">“in order that
          both should live.”</span> If one should be arrested, the action of
          the other would become immediately self-destructive.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Since the
          personification called Satan has been amply analyzed from its
          triple aspect, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Old Testament</span></span>, Christian
          Theology and the ancient Gentile attitude of thought, those who
          would learn more of the subject are referred to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span><a href="#note_671" id="noteref_671" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">671</span></span></a> and
          the Second Part of Volume II of the present work. The subject is
          here touched upon, and fresh explanations are attempted, for a very
          good reason. Before we can approach the evolution of Physical and
          Divine Man, we have first to master the idea of Cyclic Evolution,
          to acquaint ourselves with the philosophies and beliefs of the four
          Races which preceded our present Race, and to learn what were the
          ideas of those Titans and Giants—Giants, verily, mentally, as well
          as physically. The whole of antiquity was imbued with that
          philosophy which teaches the involution of Spirit into Matter, the
          progressive, downward cyclic descent, or active, self-conscious
          evolution. The Alexandrian Gnostics have sufficiently <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg 449]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg449"></a> divulged the secrets of Initiations,
          and their records are full of the <span class="tei tei-q">“falling
          down of the Æons,”</span> in their double qualification of Angelic
          Beings and Periods; the one the natural evolution of the other. On
          the other hand, Oriental traditions on both sides of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Water,”</span> the Oceans that
          separate the two <span class="tei tei-q">“Easts,”</span> are
          equally full of allegories about the downfall of the Plerôma, or
          that of the Gods and Devas. One and all, they allegorized and
          explained the Fall as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the desire to learn and acquire knowledge—the
          desire to know</span></span>. This is the natural sequence of
          mental evolution, the Spiritual becoming transmuted into the
          Material or Physical. The same law of descent into Materiality and
          of reäscent into Spirituality asserted itself during the Christian
          era, the reäction having only stopped just now, in our own special
          Sub-race.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which was
          allegorized in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pymander</span></span>, perhaps ten
          millenniums ago, for a triune mode of interpretation, and intended
          for a record of an astronomical, anthropological, and even
          alchemical fact, namely, the allegory of the Seven Rectors breaking
          through the Seven Circles of Fire, was dwarfed into one material
          and anthropomorphic interpretation—the Rebellion and Fall of the
          Angels. The multivocal, profoundly philosophical narrative, under
          its poetical form of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Marriage of
          Heaven with Earth,”</span> the love of Nature for Divine Form, and
          the Heavenly Man enraptured with his own beauty mirrored in Nature,
          that is to say, Spirit attracted into Matter, has now become, under
          theological handling, the Seven Rectors disobeying Jehovah,
          self-admiration generating Satanic pride, followed by their Fall,
          Jehovah permitting no worship to be lost save upon himself. In
          short, the beautiful Planet-Angels, the glorious Cyclic Æons of the
          Ancients, have become synthesized in their most orthodox shape in
          Samael, the Chief of the Demons in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmud</span></span>,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that Great Serpent with Twelve Wings that
          draws down after himself, in his Fall, the Solar System, or the
          Titans.”</span> But Schemal—the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">alter
          ego</span></span> and the Sabean type of Samael—in his
          philosophical and esoteric aspect, meant the <span class="tei tei-q">“Year,”</span> in its astrological evil aspect, with
          its twelve months or <span class="tei tei-q">“Wings”</span> of
          unavoidable evils, in Nature. In Esoteric Theogony both Schemal and
          Samael represented a particular divinity.<a href="#note_672" id="noteref_672" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">672</span></span></a> With
          the Kabalists they are the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of the
          Earth,”</span> the Personal God that governs it, and therefore
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">de
          facto</span></span> identical with Jehovah. For the Talmudists
          themselves admit that Samael is a god-name of one of the seven
          Elohim. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg
          450]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg450"></a>
          Kabalists, moreover, show the two, Schemal and Samael, as a
          symbolical form of Saturn, Cronus; the <span class="tei tei-q">“Twelve Wings”</span> standing for the twelve months,
          and the symbol in its collectivity representing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a racial
          cycle</span></em>. Jehovah and Saturn are also glyphically
          identical.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This leads, in
          its turn, to a very curious deduction from a Roman Catholic dogma.
          Many renowned writers belonging to the Latin Church admit that a
          difference exists, and should be made, between the Uranian Titans,
          the antediluvian Giants, who were also Titans, and those
          post-diluvian Giants, in whom the Roman Catholics persist in seeing
          the descendants of the mythical Ham. In clearer words, there is a
          difference to be made between the cosmic, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primordial</span></em> opposing Forces, guided
          by Cyclic Law, the Atlantean human Giants, and the post-diluvian
          great Adepts, whether of the Right or the Left-hand. At the same
          time they show that Michael, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">generalissimo</span></span> of the fighting
          Celestial Host, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bodyguard of Jehovah</span></em>,”</span> as
          it would seem, according to de Mirville, is also a Titan, only with
          the adjective of <span class="tei tei-q">“divine”</span> before the
          cognomen. Thus those <span class="tei tei-q">“Uranides”</span> who
          are called everywhere <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine
          Titans”</span>—and who, having rebelled against Cronus, or Saturn,
          are therefore also shown to be the enemies of Samael, also one of
          the Elohim, and synonymous with Jehovah in his collectivity—are
          identical with Michael and his Host. In short, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">rôles</span></span> are reversed, all the
          combatants are confused, and no student is able to distinguish
          clearly which is which. Esoteric explanation may, however, bring
          some order into this confusion, in which Jehovah becomes Saturn,
          and Michael and his Army, Satan and the Rebellious Angels, owing to
          the indiscreet endeavours of the too faithful zealots to see a
          Devil in every Pagan God. The true meaning is far more
          philosophical, and the legend of the first <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall”</span> of the Angels assumes a scientific
          colouring when correctly understood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cronus stands
          for endless, and hence immovable Duration, without beginning,
          without end, beyond divided Time and beyond Space. Those Angels,
          Genii, or Devas, who were born <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to act in space and
          time</span></em>, that is, to break through the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Seven
          Circles</span></em> of the super-spiritual planes into the
          phenomenal, or circumscribed, super-terrestrial regions, are said
          allegorically to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rebelled</span></em> against Cronus, and
          fought the Lion who was then the one living and highest God. When
          Cronus, in his turn, is represented as mutilating Uranus, his
          father, the meaning of the allegory is very simple. Absolute Time
          is made to become the finite and conditioned; a portion is robbed
          from the whole, thus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg
          451]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg451"></a>
          showing that Saturn, the Father of the Gods, has been transformed
          from Eternal Duration into a limited period. Cronus with his scythe
          cuts down even the longest and, to us, seemingly endless cycles,
          which, for all that, are limited in Eternity, and with the same
          scythe destroys the mightiest rebels. Aye, not one will escape the
          scythe of Time! Praise the God or Gods, or flout one or both, that
          scythe will not tremble one millionth of a second in its ascending
          or descending course.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Titans of
          Hesiod's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theogony</span></span> were copied in Greece
          from the Suras and Asuras of India. These Hesiodic Titans, the
          Uranides, which were once upon a time numbered as only six, have
          been recently discovered, in an old fragment relating to the Greek
          myth, to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em>, the seventh being called
          Phoreg. Thus their identity with the Seven Rectors is fully
          demonstrated. The origin of the War in Heaven and the Fall has, in
          our mind, to be traced unavoidably to India, and perhaps far
          earlier than the Purânic accounts thereof. For the Târakâmaya was
          in a later age, and there are accounts of three distinct Wars to be
          traced in almost every Cosmogony.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first War
          happened in the night of time, between the Gods and (A)-suras, and
          lasted for the period of one Divine Year.<a href="#note_673" id="noteref_673" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a> On
          this occasion the Deities were defeated by the Daityas, under the
          leadership of Hrâda. But afterwards, owing to a device of Vishnu,
          to whom the conquered Gods applied for help, the latter defeated
          the Asuras. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu Purâna</span></span> no interval is
          found between the two Wars. In the Esoteric Doctrine, however, one
          War takes place before the building of the Solar System; another,
          on Earth, at the <span class="tei tei-q">“creation”</span> of man;
          and a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg452"></a> third War is
          mentioned as taking place at the close of the Fourth Race, between
          its Adepts and those of the Fifth Race; that is, between the
          Initiates of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Island”</span> and
          the Sorcerers of Atlantis. We shall notice the first contest, as
          recounted by Parâshara, and endeavour to separate the two accounts,
          which are purposely blended together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is there
          stated that as the Daityas and Asuras were engaged in the duties of
          their respective Orders (Varnas) and followed the paths prescribed

          impossible for the Gods to destroy them. The prayers addressed by
          the Gods to Vishnu are curious, as showing the ideas involved in an

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above is
          quoted as an illustration of the vast field offered by the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> to adverse and erroneous
          criticism, by every European bigot who forms an estimate of an
          alien religion on mere external evidence. Any man accustomed to
          subject what he reads to thoughtful analysis, will see at a glance
          the incongruity of addressing the accepted <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknowable,”</span> the formless, and attributeless
          Absolute, such as the Vedântins define Brahman, as being
          <span class="tei tei-q">“one with the Serpent-Race, double-tongued,
          cruel and insatiable,”</span> thus associating the abstract with
          the concrete, and bestowing adjectives on that which is free from
          any limitations, and conditionless. Even Professor Wilson, who,
          after living surrounded by Brâhmans and Pandits in India for so
          many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page453">[pg 453]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg453"></a> years, ought to have
          known better—even that scholar lost no opportunity of criticizing
          the Hindû Scriptures on this account. Thus, he exclaims:</p>

<span style="font-size: 90%">the Supreme Being is not the inert
          cause of creation only, but exercises the functions of an active

          especially in those of <span class="tei tei-q">“reverend”</span>
          scholars. Universal Soul is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the inert Cause of Creation or

          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Intellectual</span></em> Kosmos, on the
          manifested plane of being. It is Mahat, or Mahâbuddhi, the Great
          Soul, the Vehicle of Spirit, the first primeval reflection of the
          formless <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cause</span></span>, and that which is
          even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond</span></em> Spirit. So much for
          Professor Wilson's uncalled-for fling at the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>. As for the apparently
          incongruous appeal to Vishnu by the defeated Gods, the explanation
          is there, in the text of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu Purâna</span></span>, if Orientalists
          would only notice it. There is Vishnu as Brahmâ, and Vishnu
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in his
          two aspects</span></em>, philosophy teaches. There is but one
          Brahman, <span class="tei tei-q">“essentially Prakriti and
          Spirit.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ignorance

          Brahmâ, <span class="tei tei-q">“the upholder of the earth,”</span>
          when they say:</p>

          a God by his actions. We must either judge these actions by the
          dead-letter narratives, or must accept them allegorically. If we
          compare the two—Vishnu, as the defender and champion of the
          defeated Gods; and Jehovah, the defender and champion of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“chosen”</span> people, so called by
          antiphrasis, no doubt, as it is the Jews who had chosen that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“jealous”</span> God—we shall find that
          both use deceit and cunning. They do so on the principle of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the end justifying the means,”</span> in
          order to have the best of their respective opponents and foes—the
          Demons. Thus while, according to the Kabalists, Jehovah assumes the
          shape of the tempting Serpent in the Garden of Eden, sends Satan
          with a special mission to tempt Job, harasses and wearies Pharaoh
          with Saraï, Abraham's wife, and <span class="tei tei-q">“hardens”</span> another Pharaoh's heart against Moses,
          lest there should be no opportunity for plaguing his victims

            (naked mendicant) with his head shaven ... he thus addressed

          Daityas were seduced by the wily talk of Mâyâmoha, as Eve was
          seduced by the advice of the Serpent. They became apostates to the

          beguiled other Daityas, by means of many other sorts of heresy. In
          a very short time, these Asuras (Daityas), deluded by the Deceiver
          [</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">who was
          Vishnu</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">] abandoned the

            Some reviled the</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">;
            others, the ceremonial of sacrifice; and others, the Brâhmans.
            This (they exclaimed), is a doctrine which will not bear
            discussion: the slaughter (of animals, in sacrifice), is not
            conducive to religious merit. (To say, that) oblations of butter
            consumed in the fire produce any future reward, is the assertion
            of a child.... If it be a fact that a beast slain in sacrifice is
            exalted to heaven, why does not the worshipper slaughter his own
            father?... Infallible utterances do not, great Asuras, fall from
            the skies; it is only assertions founded on reasoning that are
            accepted by me and by other [intelligent] persons like
            yourselves! Thus by numerous methods the Daityas were unsettled
            by the great Deceiver [</span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Reason</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">]....
            When the Daityas had entered on the path of error, the Deities
            mustered all their energies and approached to battle. Then
            followed a combat between the Gods and the Asuras; and the
            latter, who had abandoned the right road, were smitten by the

          A people, whose holy men and sages have left to the world the
          greatest and most sublime philosophies that ever emanated from the
          minds of men, must have known the difference between right and
          wrong. Even a savage can discern white from black, good from bad,
          and deceit from sincerity and truthfulness. Those who had narrated
          this event in the biography of their God, must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg456"></a> have seen that in this case it was that
          God who was the Arch-Deceiver, and the Daityas, who <span class="tei tei-q">“never transgressed the precepts of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>,”</span> who had the sunny
          side in the transaction, and who were the true <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods.”</span> Thence there must have been, and
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there
          is</span></em> a secret meaning hidden under this allegory. In no
          class of society, in no nation, are deceit and craft considered as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">divine</span></em> virtues—except perhaps in
          the clerical classes of Theologians and modern Jesuitism.</p>

          all other works of this kind, passed at a later period into the
          hands of the Temple-Brâhmans, and the old MSS. have, no doubt, been
          further tampered with by sectarians. But there was a time when the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> were esoteric works, and
          so they are still for the Initiates who can read them with the key
          that is in their possession.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
          Brâhman Initiates will ever give out the full meaning of these
          allegories, is a question with which the writer is not concerned.
          The present object is to show that, while honouring the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Creative
          Powers</span></em> in their multiple forms, no philosopher could
          have, or ever has, accepted the allegory for its true spirit,
          except, perhaps, some philosophers belonging to the present
          <span class="tei tei-q">“superior and civilized”</span> Christian
          races. For, as shown, Jehovah is not one whit the superior of
          Vishnu on the plane of ethics. This is why the Occultists, and even
          some Kabalists, whether or not they regard those creative Forces
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as living
          and conscious Entities</span></em>—and one does not see why they
          should not be so accepted—will never confuse the Cause with the
          Effect, and accept the Spirit of the Earth for Parabrahman, or Ain
          Suph. At all events they know well the true nature of what was
          called by the Greeks Father-Æther, Jupiter-Titan, etc. They know
          that the Soul of the Astral Light is divine, and its Body—the
          Light-waves on the lower planes—infernal. This Light is symbolized
          by the <span class="tei tei-q">“Magic Head”</span> in the

          Creative Gods.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To thoroughly
          comprehend the idea underlying every ancient Cosmology necessitates
          the study and comparative analysis of all the great religions of
          antiquity; for it is only by this method that the root-idea can be
          made plain. Exact Science, could it soar so high, in tracing the
          operations of Nature to their ultimate and original sources, would
          call this idea the Hierarchy of Forces. The original,
          transcendental and philosophical conception was one. But as systems
          began to reflect more and more with every age the idiosyncrasies of
          nations, and as the latter, after separating, settled into distinct
          groups, each evolving along its own national or tribal groove, the
          main idea gradually became veiled by the overgrowth of human fancy.
          While in some countries the Forces, or rather the intelligent
          Powers of Nature, received divine honours to which they were hardly
          entitled, in others—as now in Europe and the other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">civilized</span></em> lands—the very thought
          of such Forces being endowed with intelligence seems absurd, and is
          proclaimed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unscientific</span></em>. Therefore one finds
          relief in such statements as are found in the Introduction to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And though it is
          impossible for any Occultist or student of Eastern Esotericism to
          concur in the strange idea that, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          religious conceptions of the most famous nations of antiquity are

          yet glad to find such truths expressed as that: <span class="tei tei-q">“These fairy tales are not senseless stories written

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Precisely so.
          Not only their Religion, but likewise their History. For a myth, in
          Greek μῦθος, means oral tradition, passed from mouth to mouth from
          one generation to the other; and even in the modern etymology the
          term stands for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fabulous</span></em> statement conveying some
          important truth; a tale of some extraordinary personage whose
          biography has become overgrown, owing to the veneration of
          successive generations, with rich popular fancy, but which is no
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholesale</span></em> fable. Like our
          ancestors, the primitive Âryans, we believe firmly in the
          personality and intelligence of more than one phenomenon-producing
          Force in Nature.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As time rolled
          on, the archaic teaching grew dimmer; and the nations more or less
          lost sight of the Highest and One Principle of all things, and
          began to transfer the abstract attributes of the Causeless Cause to
          the caused effects, which became in their turn causative, the
          Creative Powers of the Universe; the great nations thus acted from
          fear of profaning the Idea; the smaller, because they either failed
          to grasp it, or lacked the power of philosophic conception needed
          to preserve it in all its immaculate purity. But one and all, with
          the exception of the latest Âryans, now become Europeans and
          Christians, show this veneration in their Cosmogonies. As Thomas
          Taylor,<a href="#note_686" id="noteref_686" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">686</span></span></a> the
          most intuitional of all the translators of the Greek Fragments,
          shows, no nation has ever conceived the One Principle as the
          immediate creator of the visible Universe, for no sane man would
          credit a planner and architect with having built with his own hands
          the edifice he admires. On the testimony of Damascius in his work,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On First
          Principles</span></span> (Περὶ Πρώτων Ἀρχῶν), they referred to it
          as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Unknown Darkness.”</span> The
          Babylonians passed over this principle in silence. <span class="tei tei-q">“To that God,”</span> says Porphyry, in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On
          Abstinence</span></span> (Περί ἀποχῆς τῶν ἐμψύχων), <span class="tei tei-q">“who is above all things, neither external speech ought
          to be addressed, nor yet that which is inward.”</span> Hesiod
          begins his <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg
          459]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg459"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theogony</span></span> with the words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Chaos of all things was the first
          produced,”</span><a href="#note_687" id="noteref_687" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">687</span></span></a> thus
          allowing the inference that its Cause or Producer must be passed
          over in reverential silence. Homer in his poems ascends no higher
          than Night, which he represents Zeus as reverencing. According to
          all the ancient theologists, and the doctrines of Pythagoras and
          Plato, Zeus, or the immediate Artificer of the Universe, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not the highest
          God</span></em>; any more than Sir Christopher Wren in his
          physical, human aspect is the Mind in him which produced his great
          works of art. Homer, therefore, is not only silent with respect to
          the First Principle, but likewise with respect to those two
          Principles immediately posterior to the First, the Æther and Chaos
          of Orpheus and Hesiod, and the Bound and Infinity of Pythagoras and
          Plato.<a href="#note_688" id="noteref_688" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">688</span></span></a>
          Proclus says of this Highest Principle that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“the Unity of Unities, and beyond the first Adyta ...
          more ineffable than all Silence, and more occult than all Essence
          ... concealed amidst the intelligible Gods.”</span><a href="#note_689" id="noteref_689" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">689</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To what was
          written by Thomas Taylor in 1797—namely, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Jews appear to have ascended no higher ... than the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immediate</span></em> Artificer of the
          Universe,”</span> as <span class="tei tei-q">“Moses introduces a
          darkness on the face of the deep, without even insinuating that
          there was any cause of its existence,”</span><a href="#note_690" id="noteref_690" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> one
          might add something more. Never have the Jews in their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>—a
          purely esoteric, symbolical work—so profoundly degraded their
          metaphorical deity as have the Christians, by accepting Jehovah as
          their one living yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> God.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This First, or
          rather One, Principle was called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Circle of Heaven,”</span> symbolized by the hierogram
          of a Point within a Circle or Equilateral Triangle, the Point being
          the Logos. Thus, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>, wherein Brahmâ is not
          even named. Cosmogony is preluded with the Hiranyagarbha, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Golden Egg,”</span> and Prajâpati (later
          on Brahmâ), from whom emanate all the Hierarchies of <span class="tei tei-q">“Creators.”</span> The Monad, or Point, is the original
          and is the Unit from which follows the entire numeral system. This
          Point is the First Cause, but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span> from which it
          emanates, or of which, rather, it is the expression, the Logos, is
          passed over in silence. In its turn, the universal symbol, the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Point</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg460"></a><span style="font-style: italic">within the
          Circle</span></span>, was not yet the Architect, but the Cause of
          that Architect; and the latter stood to it in precisely the same
          relation as the Point itself stood to the Circumference of the
          Circle, which cannot be defined, according to Hermes Trismegistus.
          Porphyry shows that the Monad and the Duad of Pythagoras are
          identical with Plato's Infinite and Finite, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philebus</span></span>, or what Plato calls
          the ἄπειρον and πέρας. It is the latter only, the Mother, which is
          substantial, the former being the <span class="tei tei-q">“Cause of
          all Unity and measure of all things”</span>;<a href="#note_691" id="noteref_691" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">691</span></span></a> the
          Duad, Mûlaprakriti, the Veil of Parabrahman, being thus shown to be
          the Mother of the Logos and, at the same time, his Daughter—that is
          to say, the object of his perception—the produced producer and the
          secondary cause of it. With Pythagoras, the Monad returns into
          Silence and Darkness, as soon as it has evolved the Triad, from
          which emanate the remaining 7 numbers of the 10 numbers which are
          at the base of the Manifested Universe.</p>

          the warm rays pouring from the Home of Brightness awaken life in
          the Great Waters of Space, the Elements of the First Creation come
          into view, and from them is formed the Giant Ymir, or Örgelmir
          (literally, Seething Clay), Primordial Matter differentiated from
          Chaos. Then comes the Cow Audumla, the Nourisher,<a href="#note_693" id="noteref_693" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a> from
          whom is born Buri, the Producer, whose son Bör (Born), by Bestla,
          the daughter of the Frost-Giants, the sons of Ymir, had three sons,
          Odin, Willi and We, or Spirit, Will, and Holiness. This was when
          Darkness still reigned throughout Space, when the Ases, the
          Creative Powers, or Dhyân Chohans, were not yet evolved, and the
          Yggdrasil, the Tree of the Universe of Time and of Life, had not
          yet grown, and there was, as yet, no Walhalla, or Hall of Heroes.
          The Scandinavian legends of Creation, of our Earth and World, begin
          with Time and human Life. All that precedes it is for them

          wherein All-Father, the Cause of all, dwells. As observed by the
          editor of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Asgard and the Gods</span></span>, though
          these legends have in them the idea of that All-Father, the

          than mentioned in the poems,”</span> not, as he thinks, because
          before the preaching of the Gospel, the idea <span class="tei tei-q">“could not rise to distinct conceptions of the
          Eternal,”</span> but on account of its deep esoteric character.
          Therefore, all the Creative Gods, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Personal</span></em> Deities, begin at the
          secondary stage of Cosmic Evolution. Zeus is born <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, and

            seen by the Logos with a veil thrown over it, and that veil is
            the mighty expanse of Cosmic Matter.... Parabrahman, after having
            appeared on the one hand as the Ego, and on the other as

          as unknown to us as Parabrahman is unknown in reality to the Logos,
          both Eastern Esotericism and the Kabalah, in order to bring the
          Logos within the range of our conceptions, have resolved the
          abstract synthesis into concrete images; viz., into the reflections
          or multiplied aspects of that Logos, or Avalokiteshvara, Brahmâ
          Ormazd, Osiris, Adam Kadmon, call it by any of such names you will;
          which aspects, or manvantaric emanations, are the Dhyân Chohans,
          the Elohim, the Devas, the Amshaspends, etc. Metaphysicians explain
          the root and germ of the latter, according to T. Subba Row, as the
          first manifestation of Parabrahman, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          highest trinity that we are capable of understanding,”</span> which
          is Mûlaprakriti, the Veil, the Logos, and the Conscious Energy of

          of mental and physical perception, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practical</span></em> Occultism can throw the
          Logos into visibility by geometrical figures, which, when closely

          Shekinah, and is, in another synthesis, the Wife, Daughter, and
          Mother of the Heavenly Man, Adam Kadmon, and is even identical with
          him, just as Vâch is identical with Brahmâ, and is called the
          female Logos. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span>, Vâch is <span class="tei tei-q">“Mystic Speech,”</span> by whom Occult Knowledge and

          Divine Vâch, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Queen of Gods”</span>;
          and she is associated, like Sephira with the Sephiroth, with the
          Prajâpatis in their work of creation. Moreover, she is called the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“since it is through her powers, [as Mystic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Speech</span></em>]

          Brahmâ, as the Father of men, performed the work of procreation by

          Sandhyâ, Twilight, and Shatarûpâ, of a hundred forms, is
          incessantly thrown in the teeth of the Brâhmans, as condemning
          their <span class="tei tei-q">“detestable, false religion.”</span>
          Besides the fact, conveniently forgotten by the Europeans, that the
          Patriarch Lot is shown guilty of the same crime under the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">human
          form</span></em>, whereas it was under the form of a buck that

          and not a physiological, meaning attached to the Indian allegory,
          since Vâch is a permutation of Aditi and Mûlaprakriti, or Chaos,
          and Brahmâ a permutation of Nârâyana, the Spirit of God entering

          known except through the luminous Point, the Logos, which knows not
          Parabrahman but only Mûlaprakriti. Similarly Adam Kadmon knew only
          Shekinah, though he was the Vehicle of Ain Suph. And, as Adam
          Kadmon, he is, in the Esoteric interpretation, the total of the
          Number Ten, the Sephiroth, himself being a Trinity, or the three
          attributes of the Incognizable Deity in One.<a href="#note_702" id="noteref_702" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a>

          in their totality Ten; so Brahmâ-Prajâpati, once he became
          separated from, yet identical with Vâch, caused the seven Rishis,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This will help
          the student to understand why Pythagoras esteemed the Deity, the
          Logos, to be the Centre of Unity and Source of Harmony. We say this
          Deity was the Logos, not the Monad that dwelleth in Solitude and
          Silence, because Pythagoras taught that Unity being indivisible is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no
          number</span></em>. And this is also why it was required of the
          candidate, who applied for admittance into his school, that he
          should have already studied as a preliminary step, the sciences of
          Arithmetic, Astronomy, Geometry and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Music</span></em>,
          which were held to be the four divisions of Mathematics.<a href="#note_704" id="noteref_704" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a>
          Again, this explains why the Pythagoreans asserted that the
          doctrine of Numbers, the chief of all in Esotericism, had been
          revealed to man by the Celestial Deities; that the World had been
          called forth out of Chaos by Sound, or Harmony, and constructed
          according to the principles of musical proportion; that the seven
          planets which rule the destiny of mortals have a harmonious motion
          and, as Censorinus says:</p>

          corner of the veil off those wondrous allegories that have been
          thrown over Vâch, the most mysterious of all the Brâhmanical
          Goddesses; she who is termed <span class="tei tei-q">“the

          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>,”</span> it is useless
          to refer the reader to their mystic explanations; and one may as
          well simply quote from the archaic books utterly unknown to the
          Orientalists. These works explain that which so puzzles the
          scholars, namely that the Saptarshis, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind-born Sons”</span> of Brahmâ, are referred to in
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Shatapatha Brâhmana</span></span> under one
          set of names; in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mahâbhârata</span></span> under another set;
          and that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vâyu Purâna</span></span> makes even
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nine</span></em> instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em>
          Rishis, by adding the names of Bhrigu and Daksha to the list. But
          the same occurs in every exoteric Scripture. The Secret Doctrine
          gives a long genealogy of Rishis, but separates them into many
          classes. Like the Gods of the Egyptians, who were divided into
          seven, and even twelve, Classes, so are the Indian Rishis in their
          Hierarchies. The first three Groups are the Divine, the Cosmical
          and the Sublunary. Then come the Solar Gods of our System, the
          Planetary, the Submundane, and the purely Human—the Heroes and the
          Mânushi.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At present,
          however, we are only concerned with the Pre-cosmic, Divine Gods,
          the Prajâpatis, or the Seven Builders. This Group is found
          unmistakably in every Cosmogony. Owing to the loss of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg471"></a> Egyptian archaic documents, since,
          according to M. Maspero, <span class="tei tei-q">“the materials and
          historical data on hand to study the history of the religious
          evolution in Egypt are neither complete nor very often
          intelligible,”</span> the ancient Hymns and inscriptions on the
          tombs must be appealed to, in order to have the statements brought
          forward from the Secret Doctrine partially and indirectly
          corroborated. One such shows that Osiris, like Brahmâ-Prajâpati,
          Adam Kadmon, Ormazd, and so many other Logoi, was the chief and
          synthesis of the Group of <span class="tei tei-q">“Creators”</span>
          or Builders. Before Osiris became the <span class="tei tei-q">“One”</span> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Highest</span></em>
          God of Egypt, he was worshipped at Abydos as the Head, or Leader,
          of the Heavenly Host of the Builders belonging to the higher of the
          three Orders. The Hymn engraved on the votive stele of a tomb from
          Abydos (3rd register) addresses Osiris thus:</p>

          same position as the Archangel, <span class="tei tei-q">“whose name

          says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The seven Amshaspends, who are most

          these Archangels, therefore, are as certainly the Saptarshis of the
          Hindus, though it is next to impossible to class each with its
          Pagan prototype and parallel, since, as in the case of Osiris, they
          have all so <span class="tei tei-q">“many names in towns and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One thing is
          thus undeniably proven. The more we study their Hierarchies and
          find out their identity, the more proofs we acquire that there is
          not one of the past or present <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em>
          Gods, known to us from the earliest days of history, that does not
          belong to the third stage of cosmic manifestation. In every
          religion we find the Concealed Deity forming the ground work; then
          the Ray therefrom, that falls into primordial Cosmic Matter, the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> manifestation; then the
          Androgyne result, the dual Male and Female abstract Force
          personified, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> stage; this finally
          separates itself, in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>, into Seven Forces, called
          the Creative Powers by all the ancient religions, and the Virtues
          of God by the Christians. The later explanations and abstract
          metaphysical qualifications have not prevented the Roman and Greek
          Churches from worshipping these <span class="tei tei-q">“Virtues”</span> under the personifications and
          distinct names of the Seven Archangels. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of

          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmud</span></span>, a distinction between
          these groups is given which is the correct Kabalistical
          explanation. It says:</p>

            (personal) seven Spirits of the Presence [also of the
            planets].</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
          division has to be applied to the primary, secondary and tertiary
          evolution of Gods in every Theogony, if one wishes to translate the
          meaning esoterically. We must not confuse the purely metaphysical
          personifications of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abstract</span></em> attributes of Deity, with
          their reflection—the Sidereal Gods. This reflection, however, is in
          reality the objective expression of the abstraction; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></em>
          Entities and the models formed on that divine Prototype. Moreover,
          the three metaphysical Sephiroth, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“periphrasis of Jehovah,”</span> are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
          Jehovah. It is the latter himself, with the additional titles of
          Adonai, Elohim, Sabbaoth, and the numerous names lavished on him,
          who is the periphrasis of the Shaddai (שדי), the Omnipotent. The
          name is a circumlocution, indeed, a too abundant figure of Jewish
          rhetoric, and has always been denounced by the Occultists. To the
          Jewish Kabalists, and even the Christian Alchemists and
          Rosicrucians, Jehovah was a convenient <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">screen</span></em>,
          unified by the folding of its many panels, and adopted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg473"></a> as a substitute; one name of an
          individual Sephira being as good as another name, for those who had
          the secret. The Tetragrammaton, the Ineffable, the Sidereal
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sum Total,”</span> was invented for no
          other purpose than to mislead the profane and to symbolize life and
          generation.<a href="#note_713" id="noteref_713" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a> The

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Word that is no word,”</span> has to be
          sought in the seven names of the first Seven Emanations, or the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sons of the Fire,”</span> in the secret
          Scriptures of all the great nations, and even in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Zohar</span></span>,
          the Kabalistic lore of the smallest of all of them, viz., the
          Jewish. This word, composed of seven letters in every tongue, is
          found embodied in the architectural remains of every great sacred
          building in the world; from the Cyclopean remains on Easter
          Island—part of a Continent buried under the seas nearer 4,000,000

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall have to
          enter more fully into this subject later on, and to bring practical
          illustrations to prove the statements made in the text.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the present
          it is sufficient to show, by a few instances, the truth of what has
          been asserted at the beginning of this work, namely, that no
          Cosmogony, the world over, with the sole exception of the
          Christian, has ever attributed to the One Highest Cause, the
          Universal Deific Principle, the immediate creation of our earth, or
          man, or anything connected with these. This statement holds as well
          for the Hebrew or Chaldean <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kabalah</span></span> as it does for
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, had the latter been
          ever thoroughly understood and, what is still more important,
          correctly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg
          474]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg474"></a>
          translated.<a href="#note_715" id="noteref_715" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a>
          Everywhere there is either a Logos—a <span class="tei tei-q">“Light
          shining in Darkness,”</span> truly—or the Architect of the Worlds
          is esoterically in the plural number. The Latin Church, paradoxical
          as ever, while applying the epithet of Creator to Jehovah alone,
          adopts a whole Kyriel of names for the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">working</span></em>
          Forces of the latter, names which betray the secret. For if the
          said Forces had nought to do with <span class="tei tei-q">“Creation”</span> so-called, why call them Elohim
          (Alhim), a plural word; Divine Workmen and Energies (Ἐνέργειαι),
          incandescent celestial stones (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lapides igniti
          cœlorum</span></span>); and especially Supporters of the World
          (Κοσμοκράτορες), Governors or Rulers of the World (Rectores Mundi),
          Wheels of the World (Rotæ), Auphanim, Flames and Powers, Sons of
          God (B'ne Alhim), Vigilant Counsellors, etc.?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is often
          asserted, and unjustly, as usual, that China, nearly as old a
          country as India, had no Cosmogony. It was unknown to Confucius,
          and the Buddhists extended their Cosmogony without introducing a
          Personal God,<a href="#note_716" id="noteref_716" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> it is
          complained. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Yi-King</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the very essence of ancient thought and the combined
          work of the most venerated sages,”</span> fails to show a distinct
          Cosmogony. Nevertheless, one existed, and a very distinct one. Only
          as Confucius did not admit of a future life<a href="#note_717" id="noteref_717" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a> and
          the Chinese Buddhists reject the idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One</span></em>
          Creator, accepting one Cause and its numberless effects, they are
          misunderstood by the believers in a Personal God. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Extreme,”</span> as the commencement of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“changes”</span> (transmigrations), is the
          shortest and, perhaps, the most suggestive of all Cosmogonies for
          those who, like the Confucianists, love virtue for its own sake and
          try to do good unselfishly without <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg475"></a> perpetually looking to reward and profit. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Extreme”</span> of Confucius
          produces <span class="tei tei-q">“Two Figures.”</span> These Two
          produce in their turn the <span class="tei tei-q">“Four
          Images”</span>; these again the <span class="tei tei-q">“Eight
          Symbols.”</span> It is complained that though the Confucianists see
          in them <span class="tei tei-q">“heaven, earth and man in
          miniature,”</span> we can see in them anything we like. No doubt,
          and so it is with regard to many symbols, especially those of the
          latest religions. But they who know something of Occult numerals,
          see in these <span class="tei tei-q">“Figures”</span> the symbol,
          however rude, of a harmonious progressive Evolution of Kosmos and
          its Beings, both Heavenly and Terrestrial. And any one who has
          studied the numerical evolution in the primeval Cosmogony of
          Pythagoras—a contemporary of Confucius—can never fail to find in
          his Triad, Tetraktys and Decad, emerging from the One and solitary
          Monad, the same idea. Confucius is laughed at by his Christian
          biographer for <span class="tei tei-q">“talking of
          divination,”</span> before and after this passage, and is
          represented as saying:</p>

          suspended images brighter than the sun and moon. In preparing

          looks at them as they become one and two, and two become four, and
          four become eight, and the other sets <span class="tei tei-q">“three and six,”</span> are laughed to scorn, only
          because his wise symbols are misunderstood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So the author of

          idea</span></em>. The old archaic map of Cosmogony is full of lines
          in the Confucian style, of concentric circles and dots. Yet all
          these represent the most abstract and philosophical conceptions of
          the Cosmogony of our Universe. At all events it may, perhaps,
          answer better to the requirements and the scientific purposes of
          our age, than the cosmogonical essays of St. Augustine and the
          Venerable Bede, though these were published over a millennium later
          than the Confucian.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Confucius, one

          philosopher, the Popes of Rome threatened and even burnt
          <span class="tei tei-q">“heretics”</span> for asserting the same.
          He is laughed at for speaking of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Tortoise.”</span> No unprejudiced person can
          see any great difference between a Tortoise and a Lamb as
          candidates for sacredness, as both are symbols and no more. The Ox,
          the Eagle,<a href="#note_719" id="noteref_719" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">719</span></span></a> and
          the Lion, and occasionally the Dove are the <span class="tei tei-q">“sacred animals”</span> of the Western <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>;
          the first three are found grouped round the Evangelists; the
          fourth, associated with these, a human face, is a Seraph,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a <span class="tei tei-q">“fiery serpent,”</span> the Gnostic Agathodæmon
          probably.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The choice is
          curious, and shows how paradoxical were the first Christians in
          their selections. For why should they have chosen these symbols of
          Egyptian Paganism, when the Eagle is never mentioned in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unclean</span></em>; when the Lion is made a
          point of comparison with Satan, both roaring for men to devour; and
          the Oxen are driven out of the Temple? On the other hand the
          Serpent, brought in as an exemplar of wisdom, is now regarded as
          the symbol of the Devil. The esoteric pearl of Christ's religion,
          degraded into Christian theology, may indeed be said to have chosen
          a strange and unfitting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shell</span></em> to be born in and evolved
          from.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As explained,
          the Sacred Animals and the Flames or Sparks, within the Holy Four,

          representatives of the seven and fourteen Cycles of Existence, or
          Days of Brahmâ, thus answering to the seven Æons, when, at the end
          of the first stage of Evolution, they are transformed into the

          Doubles appear as Heroes, Kings and Sages on this earth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Esoteric
          Doctrine of the East having thus furnished and struck the key-note,
          which, under its allegorical garb, is, as may be seen, as
          scientific as it is philosophical and poetical, every nation has
          followed its lead. It is from the exoteric religions that we have
          to dig out the root-idea before we turn to esoteric truths, lest
          the latter should be rejected. Furthermore, every symbol, in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em> national religion, may be
          read esoterically; and the proof of its being correctly read when
          transliterated into its corresponding numerals and geometrical
          forms, may be obtained from the extraordinary agreement of all
          glyphs and symbols, however much they may externally vary among
          themselves. For in the origin those symbols were all identical.
          Take, for instance, the opening sentences in various Cosmogonies;
          in every case it is a Circle, an Egg, or a Head. Darkness is always
          associated with this first symbol and surrounds it, as is shown in
          the Hindû, the Egyptian, the Chaldeo-Hebrew and even the
          Scandinavian systems. Hence black ravens, black doves, black waters
          and even black flames; the seventh tongue of Agni, the Fire-God
          being called Kâlî, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Black,”</span>
          since it was a black flickering flame. Two <span class="tei tei-q">“black”</span> doves flew from Egypt and, settling on
          the oaks of Dodona, gave their names to the Grecian Gods. Noah
          sends out a <span class="tei tei-q">“black”</span> raven after the
          Deluge, which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page478">[pg
          478]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg478"></a>
          is a symbol for the Cosmic Pralaya, after which began the real
          creation or evolution of our Earth and Humanity. Odin's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“black”</span> ravens fluttered round the
          Goddess Saga and <span class="tei tei-q">“whispered to her of the
          past and of the future.”</span> Now what is the inner meaning of
          all those black birds? It is that they are all connected with the
          primeval Wisdom, which flows out of the pre-cosmic Source of All,
          symbolized by the Head, the Circle or the Egg; and they all have an
          identical meaning and relate to the primordial Archetypal Man, Adam
          Kadmon, the Creative Origin of all things, which is composed of the
          Host of Cosmic Powers—the Creative Dhyân Chohans, beyond which all
          is Darkness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The basic idea underlying the philosophy of the

          positions occupied therein by Rudra and Vishnu, who became the

          Iaô, the Mystery God and the Regent of the Moon, as given in

          that on this account they termed Iaô Hebdomas, while his mother was
          called Ogdoas, because, as he explains, <span class="tei tei-q">“she preserved the number of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first begotten

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
          <span class="tei tei-q">“first begotten Ogdoad”</span> was in
          Theogony the Second Logos, the Manifested, because it was born of
          the Seven-fold First Logos, hence it is the eighth on this
          manifested plane; and in Astrolatry, it was the Sun, Mârttânda, the
          eighth Son of Aditi, whom she rejects while preserving her Seven
          Sons, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the

          as a planet, but as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a central and fixed Star</span></em>. This,
          then, is the second Hebdomad born of the Seven-rayed One, Agni, the
          Sun and what not, only not the seven planets, which are Sûrya's
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Brothers</span></em>, not his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sons</span></em>.

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg 484]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg484"></a> is the Plerôma.
          Ialdabaoth produces from himself these six stellar Spirits: Iaô

          it is they who are the second, or inferior Hebdomad. As to the
          third, it is composed of the seven primeval men, the shadows of the
          Lunar Gods, projected by the first Hebdomad. In this the Gnostics
          did not, as seen, differ much from the Esoteric Doctrine, except
          that they veiled it. As to the charge made by Irenæus, who was
          evidently ignorant of the true tenets of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heretics,”</span> with regard to man being created on
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sixth</span></em> day, and man being created
          on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eighth</span></em>, this relates to the
          mysteries of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner</span></em> man. It will become
          comprehensible to the reader only after he has read Volume II, and
          understood well the Anthropogenesis of the Esoteric Doctrine.</p>

          Ialdabaoth boasts likewise: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am Father
          and God, and there is no one above me,”</span> he exclaims. For
          which his Mother coolly puts him down by saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not lie, Ialdabaoth, for the Father of all, the

          is a good proof that there were three Logoi—besides the Seven born
          of the First—one of these being the Solar Logos. And, again, who
          was that Anthrôpos himself, so much higher than Ialdabaoth? The
          Gnostic records alone can solve this riddle. In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pistis-Sophia</span></span> the four-vowelled
          name Ieou is generally accompanied by the epithet of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Primal, or First Man.”</span> This shows again
          that the Gnôsis was but an echo of our Archaic Doctrine. The names
          answering to Parabrahman, to Brahmâ, and Manu, the first <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinking</span></em> Man, are composed of
          one-vowelled, three-vowelled and seven-vowelled sounds. Marcus,
          whose philosophy was certainly more Pythagorean than anything else,
          speaks of a revelation to him of the seven Heavens sounding each
          one vowel, as they pronounced the seven names of the seven Angelic
          Hierarchies.</p>

          faithful, echo of primitive Wisdom. They are like the 12,000 Divine
          Years of the Gods, a cyclic blind. Every Day of Brahmâ has 14
          Manus, which the Hebrew Kabalists, following, however, in this the
          Chaldeans, have disguised into 12 <span class="tei tei-q">“Hours.”</span><a href="#note_740" id="noteref_740" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a> The
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nuchthemeron</span></span> of Apollonius of

          lies concealed in the perfect Cube,”</span> say the Kabalists. The
          mystic meaning of this is, that the twelve great transformations of
          Spirit into Matter—the 12,000 Divine Years—take place during the
          four great Ages, or the first Mahâyuga. Beginning with the
          metaphysical and the supra-human, it ends in the physical and
          purely human natures of Kosmos and Man. Eastern Philosophy can give
          the number of mortal years that run along the line of spiritual and
          physical evolutions of the seen and the unseen, if Western Science
          fails to do so.</p>

          that, therefore, Brahmâ, Mahat, Îshvara, or whatever name the
          Creative Power may be known by, Creative Gods and all, are simply
          an illusive aspect of Parabrahman in the conception of the
          conceivers; while the other sects identify the Impersonal Cause
          with the Creator, or Îshvara.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mahat, or

          says, <span class="tei tei-q">“was the first product of the

          concerning the Patriarchs, such <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page488">[pg 488]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg488"></a> as Lot and even Adam,<a href="#note_746" id="noteref_746" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> and

          that the Third Creation <span class="tei tei-q">“abounding with the
          quality of goodness,”</span> is termed Ûrdhvasrotas; and a page or
          two further the Ûrdhvasrotas Creation is referred to as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the sixth creation ... or that of the
          divinities.”</span> This shows plainly that earlier as well as
          later Manvantaras have been purposely confused, to prevent the
          profane from perceiving the truth. This is called <span class="tei tei-q">“incongruity”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“contradictions”</span> by the Orientalists.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The three creations beginning with
          Intelligence are elemental, but the six creations which proceed

          Creation was that of Mahat, Intellect being the first in
          manifestation,”</span> we must refer that (specified) creation to
          the first evolution of our System or even our Earth, none of the
          preceding ones being discussed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, but only occasionally

          general, and not specifically to our Manvantara, which begins with
          the same over and over again, thus showing that it refers to
          several distinct Kalpas. For it is said <span class="tei tei-q">“at
          the close of the past [Pâdma] Kalpa the divine Brahmâ awoke from
          his night of sleep and beheld the Universe void.”</span> Then

          gives a correct idea of the Sanskrit words used. Esoteric
          Philosophy is not alone in rejecting the idea of any atom being
          <span class="tei tei-q">“inorganic,”</span> for it is found also in
          orthodox Hindûism. Moreover, Wilson himself says: <span class="tei tei-q">“All the Hindû systems consider vegetable bodies as
          endowed with life.”</span><a href="#note_751" id="noteref_751" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a>
          Charâchara, or the synonymous sthâvara and jangama, is, therefore,

          and <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“conscious and unconscious beings,”</span> etc.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Locomotive and fixed”</span> would be
          better, <span class="tei tei-q">“since trees are considered to
          possess souls.”</span> The Mukhya is the <span class="tei tei-q">“creation,”</span> or rather organic evolution, of the
          vegetable kingdom. In this Secondary Period, the three degrees of
          the elemental or rudimental kingdoms are evolved in this World,
          corresponding, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inversely</span></em> in order, to the three
          Prâkritic Creations, during the Primary Period of Brahmâ's
          activity. As in that Period, in the words of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu
          Purâna</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the first creation
          was that of Mahat or Intellect.... The second was that of the
          Rudimental Principles (Tanmâtras).... The third was ... the
          creation of the senses (Aindriyaka)”</span>; so in this one, the
          order of the Elemental Forces stands thus: (1) the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nascent</span></em>
          Centres of Force, intellectual and physical; (2) the Rudimentary
          Principles, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nerve force</span></em>, so to say; and (3)
          nascent Apperception, which is the Mahat of the lower kingdoms, and
          is especially developed in the third order of Elementals; these are
          succeeded by the objective kingdom of minerals, in which this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“apperception”</span> is entirely latent,
          to re-develop only in the plants. The Mukhya Creation, then, is the
          middle point between the three lower and the three higher kingdoms,
          which represent the seven esoteric kingdoms of Kosmos, and of
          Earth.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg

          seven planes is concerned. It is at this period of evolution that
          the absolutely eternal universal motion, or vibration, that which
          is called in Esoteric language the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great
          Breath,”</span> differentiates into the primordial, first
          manifested Atom. More and more, as chemical and physical sciences
          progress, does this Occult axiom find its corroboration in the
          world of knowledge; the scientific hypothesis, that even the

          differ from each other only in consequence of the various
          distributions of atoms in the molecule or speck of substance, or of

          translation of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hari Vamsha</span></span>, it is said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“The seven Prajâpati, Rudra, Skanda (his
          son) and Sanatkumâra proceeded to create beings.”</span> Whereas,
          as Wilson shows, the original is: <span class="tei tei-q">“These
          seven ... created progeny; and so did Rudra, but Skanda and
          Sanatkumâra, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">restraining their power, abstained</span></em>
          (from creation).”</span> The <span class="tei tei-q">“four orders
          of beings”</span> are referred to sometimes as Ambhâmsi, which
          Wilson renders as <span class="tei tei-q">“literally Waters”</span>
          and believes it <span class="tei tei-q">“a mystic term.”</span> It
          is one, no doubt; but he evidently failed to catch the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          Esoteric meaning. <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Water”</span> stand as the symbol for
          Âkâsha, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Primordial Ocean of
          Space,”</span> on which Nârâyana, the self-born Spirit, moves,
          reclining on that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which is its progeny</span></em>.<a href="#note_761" id="noteref_761" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">761</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“Water is the body of Nara; thus we have

<span class="tei tei-q">“Pure, Purusha created the Waters
          pure.”</span> At the same time Water is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Third</span></em>
          Principle in material Kosmos, and the third in the realm of the
          Spiritual: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em> of Fire, Flame, Âkâsha,
          Ether, Water, Air, Earth, are the cosmic, sidereal, psychic,

          orders of beings to whom the term Ambhâmsi is applied, because they
          are all the product of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Waters</span></em> (mystically), of the
          Âkâshic Ocean, and of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Third</span></em> principle in Nature. In the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span> it is a synonym of Gods.
          Pitris and Men on Earth are the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg495"></a> transformations or rebirths of Gods and
          Demons (Spirits) on a higher plane. Water is, in another sense, the
          feminine principle. Venus Aphrodite is the personified Sea, and the
          Mother of the God of Love, the Generatrix of all the Gods, as much
          as the Christian Virgin Mary is Mare, the Sea, the Mother of the
          Western God of Love, Mercy and Charity. If the student of Esoteric
          Philosophy thinks deeply over the subject, he is sure to find out
          all the suggestiveness of the term Ambhâmsi, in its manifold
          relations to the Virgin in Heaven, to the Celestial Virgin of the
          Alchemists, and even to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all the seven

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Fallen</span></em> Angels, and now call them
          Satan and Demons; as among these heavenly denizens who <span class="tei tei-q">“refuse to create,”</span> the Archangel Michael, the
          greatest patron Saint of the Western and Eastern Churches, under
          his double name of St. Michael and his supposed copy on earth, St.
          George conquering the Dragon, has to be given one of the most
          prominent places.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Kumâras, the
          Mind-born Sons of Brahmâ-Rudra, or Shiva, mystically the howling
          and terrific <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">destroyer of human passions and physical

          the higher spiritual perceptions and the growth of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner</span></em>
          eternal man, are the progeny of Shiva, the Mahâyogî, the great
          patron of all the Yogîs and Mystics of India.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shiva-Rudra is
          the Destroyer, as Vishnu is the Preserver; and both are the
          Regenerators of spiritual as well as of physical Nature. To live as
          a plant, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seed</span></em> must die. To live as a
          conscious entity in the Eternity, the passions and senses of man
          must die before his body does. <span class="tei tei-q">“That to
          live is to die and to die is to live,”</span> has been too little
          understood in the West. Shiva, the Destroyer, is the Creator and
          the Saviour of Spiritual Man, as he is the good gardener of Nature.
          He weeds out the plants, human and cosmic, and kills the passions
          of the physical, to call to life the perceptions of the spiritual,
          man.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Kumâras,

          Angel of the Jews <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">preside</span></em> over Saturn (Shiva or
          Rudra), and the Sabbath, the day of Saturn? Is he not shown of the
          same essence with his Father (Saturn), and called the Son of Time,
          Cronus, or Kâla, a form of Brahmâ (Vishnu and Shiva)? And is not
          Old Time of the Greeks, with its scythe and sand-glass, identical
          with the Ancient of Days of the Kabalists; the latter <span class="tei tei-q">“Ancient”</span> being one with the Hindû Ancient of
          Days, Brahmâ, in his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">triune</span></em> form, whose name is also
          Sanat, the Ancient? Every Kumâra bears the prefix of Sanat and
          Sana. And Shanaishchara is Saturn, the planet Shani, the King
          Saturn, whose Secretary in Egypt was Thot-Hermes the first. They
          are thus identified both with the planet and the God (Shiva), who
          are, in their turn, shown to be the prototypes of Saturn, who is
          the same as Bel, Baal, Shiva, and Jehovah Sabbaoth, the Angel of
          the Face of whom is Mikael—מיכאל, <span class="tei tei-q">“who [is]
          as God.”</span> He is the patron, and guardian Angel of the Jews,
          as Daniel tells us; and, before the Kumâras were degraded, by those
          who were ignorant of their very name, into Demons and Fallen
          Angels, the Greek Ophites, the occultly inclined predecessors and
          precursors of the Roman Catholic Church after its secession and
          separation from the primitive Greek Church, had identified Michael
          with their Ophiomorphos, the rebellious and opposing spirit. This
          means nothing more than the reverse aspect, symbolically, of Ophis,
          the Divine Wisdom or Christos. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Talmud</span></span>,
          Mikael is <span class="tei tei-q">“Prince of Water”</span> and the
          chief of the Seven Spirits, for the same reason that one of his
          many prototypes, Sanatsujâta, the chief of the Kumâras, is called
          Ambhâmsi, <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters,”</span> according to the
          commentary on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu Purâna</span></span>. Why? Because the
          Waters is another name of the Great Deep, the Primordial Waters of
          Space, or Chaos, and also means Mother, Ambâ, meaning Aditi and
          Akâsha, the Celestial Virgin-Mother of the visible Universe.
          Furthermore, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters of the
          Flood”</span> are also called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great
          Dragon,”</span> or Ophis, Ophiomorphos.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rudras will
          be noticed in their septenary character of <span class="tei tei-q">“Fire-Spirits”</span> in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Symbolism”</span> attached to the Stanzas in Volume

          primeval and later forms, and shall use for purposes of comparison
          the Pythagorean numbers side by side with Hebrew metrology. The
          immense importance of the number <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em>
          will thus become evident, as the root number of Nature. We shall

          Elements.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Metaphysically
          and esoterically, there is but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One
          Element</span></em> in Nature, and at the root of it is the Deity;
          and the so-called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seven</span></em> Elements, of which
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five</span></em> have already manifested and
          asserted their existence, are the garment, the veil, of that Deity,
          direct from the essence whereof comes Man, whether considered
          physically, psychically, mentally or spiritually. Four Elements
          only are generally spoken of in later antiquity, while five only
          are admitted in philosophy. For the body of Ether is not fully
          manifested yet, and its noumenon is still the <span class="tei tei-q">“Omnipotent Father Æther,”</span> the synthesis of the
          rest. But what are these Elements, whose compound bodies have now
          been discovered by Chemistry and Physics to contain numberless
          sub-elements, even the sixty or seventy of which no longer embrace
          the whole number suspected? Let us follow their evolution from the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em> beginnings, at any
          rate.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Four
          Elements were fully characterized by Plato when he said that they
          were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">composes</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">decomposes</span></em> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">compound
          bodies</span></em>.”</span> Hence Cosmolatry was never, even in its
          worst aspect, the fetichism which adores or worships the passive
          external form and matter of any object, but looked ever to the
          Noumenon therein. Fire, Air, Water, Earth, were but the visible
          garb, the symbols of the informing, invisible Souls or Spirits, the
          Cosmic Gods, to whom worship was offered by the ignorant, and
          simple, but respectful, recognition by the wiser. In their turn,
          the phenomenal subdivisions of the noumenal Elements were informed
          by the Elementals, so-called, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Nature
          Spirits”</span> of lower grades.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Theogony

          <span class="tei tei-q">“brooding over the Chaos,”</span> the

          close, indeed, that the Hierarchies of these Potencies, or Forces,
          have been classified on a graduated scale of seven from the
          ponderable to the imponderable. They are septenary, not as an
          artificial aid to facilitate their comprehension, but in their real
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cosmic</span></em> gradation, from their
          chemical, or physical, to their purely spiritual composition. Gods
          with the ignorant masses; Gods independent and supreme; Demons with
          the fanatics, who, intellectual as they often may be, are unable to
          understand the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spirit</span></em> of the philosophical
          sentence, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in pluribus unum</span></span>. With the

          principles in them he deals with. It required long millenniums
          before they found themselves finally, in our cultured age, degraded
          into simple chemical elements.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At any rate,
          good Christians, and especially the Biblical Protestants, ought to
          show more reverence for the Four Elements, if they would maintain
          any for Moses. For the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> manifests the
          consideration and mystic significance in which they were held by
          the Hebrew Lawgiver, on every page of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pentateuch</span></span>. The tent which
          contained the Holy of Holies was a Cosmic Symbol, sacred, in one of
          its meanings, to the Elements, the four cardinal points, and Ether.
          Josephus shows it built in white, the colour of Ether. And this
          explains also why, in the Egyptian and the Hebrew temples,
          according to Clemens <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg

          Alexandrinus,<a href="#note_766" id="noteref_766" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">766</span></span></a> a

          profane. By its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em> colours this curtain
          symbolized the four principal Elements, and with the five pillars
          signified the knowledge of the divine that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five</span></em>
          senses can enable man to acquire with the help of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">four</span></em>

          day.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It states that
          from Ether have come all things, and to it all will return; that
          the images of all things are indelibly impressed upon it; and that
          it is the store-house of the germs, or of the remains of all
          visible forms, and even ideas. It appears as if this case strangely
          corroborates our assertion that whatever discoveries may be made in
          our days will be found to have been anticipated by many thousand
          years by our <span class="tei tei-q">“simple-minded

          Rabbins and the later Fathers of the Church, into Jehovah, but
          their origin is identical with that of the Cosmic Gods of all other
          nations. Their symbols, whether born on the shores of the Oxus, on
          the burning sands of Upper Egypt, or in the wild forests, weird and
          glacial, which cover the slopes and peaks of the sacred snowy
          mountains of Thessaly, or again, in the pampas of America—their
          symbols, we repeat, when traced to their source, are ever one and
          the same. Whether Egyptian or Pelasgian, Âryan or Semitic, the
          Genius Loci, the Local God, embraced in its unity all Nature; but
          not especially the four elements any more than one of their
          creations, such as trees, rivers, mounts or stars. The Genius Loci,
          a very late afterthought of the last sub-races of the Fifth
          Root-Race, when the primitive and grandiose meaning had become
          nearly lost, was ever the representative, in his accumulated
          titles, of all his colleagues. It was the God of Fire, symbolized
          by thunder, as Jove or Agni; the God of Water, symbolized by the
          fluvial bull, or some sacred river or fountain, as Varuna, Neptune,
          etc.; the God of Air, manifesting in the hurricane and tempest, as
          Vâyu and Indra; and the God or Spirit of the Earth, who appeared in
          earthquakes, like Pluto, Yama, and so many others.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page501">[pg 501]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg501"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These were the
          Cosmic Gods, ever synthesizing all in one, as found in every
          cosmogony or mythology. Thus, the Greeks had their Dodonean
          Jupiter, who included in himself the four Elements and the four
          cardinal points, and who was recognized, therefore, in old Rome
          under the pantheistic title of Jupiter Mundus; and who now, in
          modern Rome, has become the Deus Mundus, the one Mundane God, who
          is made to swallow all others, in the latest theology, by the
          arbitrary decision of his special ministers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Gods of Fire,
          Air, and Water, they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Celestial</span></em> Gods; as Gods of the
          Lower Region, they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Infernal</span></em> Deities; the latter
          adjective applying simply to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Earth</span></em>.
          They were <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirits of the Earth”</span>
          under their respective names of Yama, Pluto, Osiris, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of the Lower Kingdom,”</span> etc.,
          and their tellurial character sufficiently proves it. The Ancients
          knew of no worse abode after death than the Kâma Loka, the Limbus
          on this Earth.<a href="#note_767" id="noteref_767" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">767</span></span></a> If it
          is argued that the Dodonean Jupiter was identified with Dis, or the
          Roman Pluto with the Dionysus Chthonius, the Subterranean, and with
          Aïdoneus, the King of the Subterranean World, wherein, according to
          Creuzer,<a href="#note_768" id="noteref_768" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">768</span></span></a>
          oracles were rendered, then it will become the pleasure of the
          Occultists to prove that both Aïdoneus and Dionysus are the bases
          of Adonaï, or Iurbo-Adonaï, as Jehovah is called in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Codex
          Nazaræus</span></span>. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not
          worship the Sun, who is named Adonaï, whose name is also Kadush and
          El-El,”</span><a href="#note_769" id="noteref_769" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a> and
          also <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord Bacchus.”</span> Baal-Adonis of
          the Sôds, or Mysteries, of the pre-Babylonian Jews became the
          Adonaï by the Massorah, the later vowelled Jehovah. Hence the Roman
          Catholics are right. All these Jupiters are of the same family; but
          Jehovah has to be included therein to make it complete. The Jupiter
          Aërius or Pan, the Jupiter-Ammon, and the Jupiter-Bel-Moloch, are
          all correlations and one with Iurbo-Adonaï, because they are all
          one Cosmic Nature. It is that Nature and Power which creates the
          specific terrestrial symbol, and the physical and material fabric
          of the latter, which proves the Energy manifesting through it as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extrinsic</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For primitive
          religion was something better than simple preöccupation about

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The four-fold
          Jupiter, as the four-faced Brahmâ, the aërial, the fulgurant, the
          terrestrial, and the marine God, the lord and master of the four
          Elements, may stand as a representative for the great Cosmic Gods
          of every nation. Although deputing power over the fire to
          Hephæstus-Vulcan, over the sea to Poseidon-Neptune, and over the
          Earth to Pluto-Aïdoneus, the Aërial Jove was still all these; for
          Æther, from the first, had preëminence over, and was the synthesis
          of, all the Elements.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tradition tells
          of a grotto, a vast cave in the deserts of Central Asia, whereinto
          light pours, through four seemingly natural apertures, or clefts
          placed crossways at the four cardinal points. From noon till an
          hour before sunset the light streams in, of four different colours,
          as averred, red, blue, orange-gold, and white, owing to some either
          natural or artificially prepared conditions of vegetation and soil.
          The light converges in the centre round a pillar of white marble
          with a globe upon it, which represents our earth. It is named the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Grotto of Zarathustra.”</span></p>

          the arts and sciences of the Fourth Race, the Atlanteans, the
          phenomenal manifestation of the Four Elements, which were justly
          attributed by these believers to the intelligent interference of
          the Cosmic Gods, assumed a scientific character. The Magic of the
          ancient priests consisted, in those days, in addressing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their Gods in their

          Paul, has no right to pick out from the latter those sentences only
          which he chooses to accept, to the rejection of others; and St.
          Paul teaches most undeniably the existence of Cosmic Gods and their
          presence among us. Paganism preached a dual and simultaneous
          evolution, a <span class="tei tei-q">“creation”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">spiritualem ac
          mundanum</span></span>, as the Roman Church has it, ages before the

          little with respect to Divine Hierarchies since the most palmy days
          of Paganism, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Idolatry.”</span> Names
          alone have changed, together with claims which have now become
          false pretences. For when, for instance, Plato put in the mouth of
          the Highest Principle (Father Æther or Jupiter) the words,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Gods of the Gods of whom I am the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">maker</span></em>, as I am the father of all
          their works,”</span> he knew the spirit of this sentence as fully,
          we suspect, as St. Paul did, when saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“For though there be that are called Gods, whether in
          Heaven or in Earth, as there be Gods many and Lords

          guarded terms.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We cannot be
          taken to task by the Protestants for interpreting the verse from
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Corinthians</span></span> as we do; for, if
          the translation in the English <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
          is made ambiguous, it is not so in the original texts, and the
          Roman Catholic Church accepts the words of the Apostle in their
          true sense. For a proof see St. Dionysius, the Areopagite, who was
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">directly inspired</span></em> by the
          Apostle,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“who wrote under his
          dictation,”</span> as we are assured by the Marquis de Mirville,
          whose works are approved by Rome, and who says, commenting on that
          special verse: <span class="tei tei-q">“And, though there are (in
          fact) they who are called Gods, for it seems there are really

          this day, to the same <span class="tei tei-q">“God of Wind and
          Water”</span>? They do; because special prayers for rain, dry
          weather, trade-winds and the calming of storms on the seas, exist
          to this hour in the prayer-books of the three Christian Churches;
          and the several hundred sects of the Protestant religion offer them
          to their God upon every threat of calamity. The fact that they are
          no more answered by Jehovah, than they were, probably, by Jupiter
          Pluvius, does not alter the fact of these prayers being addressed
          to the Power, or Powers, supposed to rule over the Elements, or of
          these Powers being identical in Paganism and Christianity; or have
          we to believe that such prayers are crass idolatry and absurd
          <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition”</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>
          when addressed by a Pagan to his <span class="tei tei-q">“idol,”</span> and that the same superstition is
          suddenly transformed into <span class="tei tei-q">“praiseworthy
          piety”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“religion”</span>
          whenever the name of the celestial addressee is changed? But the
          tree <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> known by its fruit. And the
          fruit of the Christian tree being no better than that of the tree
          of Paganism, why should the former command more reverence than the
          latter?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, when we
          are told by the Chevalier Drach, a converted Jew, and by the
          Marquis de Mirville, a Roman Catholic fanatic of the French
          aristocracy, that in Hebrew <span class="tei tei-q">“lightning”</span> is a synonym of <span class="tei tei-q">“fury,”</span> and is always handled by the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“evil”</span> Spirit; that Jupiter Fulgur
          or Fulgurans is also called by the Christians Elicius, and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page506">[pg 506]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg506"></a> denounced as the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“soul of lightning,”</span> its

          have either to apply the same explanation and definitions to the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord God of Israel,”</span> under the same
          circumstances, or renounce our right of abusing the Gods and creeds
          of other nations.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
          statements, emanating as they do from two ardent and learned Roman
          Catholics, are, to say the least, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dangerous</span></em>, in the presence of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> and its prophets. Indeed,
          if Jupiter, the <span class="tei tei-q">“chief Dæmon of the Pagan
          Greeks,”</span> hurled his deadly thunder-bolts and lightnings at
          those who excited his wrath, so did the Lord God of Abraham and
          Jacob. For we read that:</p>

          them.</span><a href="#note_778" id="noteref_778" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Athenians
          are accused of having sacrificed to Boreas; and this <span class="tei tei-q">“Dæmon”</span> is charged with having submerged and
          wrecked 400 ships of the Persian fleet on the rocks of Mount
          Pelion, and of having become so furious that all the Magi of Xerxes
          could hardly counteract him by offering contra-sacrifices to
          Thetis.<a href="#note_779" id="noteref_779" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> Very
          fortunately, no authenticated instance is on the records of
          Christian wars, showing a like catastrophe on the same scale
          happening to one Christian fleet, owing to the <span class="tei tei-q">“prayers”</span> of its enemy—another Christian nation.
          But this is from no fault of theirs, for each prays as ardently to
          Jehovah for the destruction of the other, as the Athenians prayed
          to Boreas. Both resorted to a neat little piece of black magic
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">con
          amore</span></span>. Such abstinence from divine interference being
          hardly due to lack of prayers, sent to a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">common</span></em>
          Almighty God for mutual destruction, where, then, shall we draw the
          line between Pagan and Christian? And who can doubt that all
          Protestant England would rejoice and offer thanks to the Lord, if
          during some future war, 400 ships of the hostile fleet were to be
          wrecked owing to such holy prayers? What is, then, the difference,
          we ask again, between a Jupiter, a Boreas, and a Jehovah? No more
          than this: The crime of one's own next-of-kin, say of one's father,
          is always excused and often exalted, whereas the crime of our
          neighbour's parent is ever gladly punished by hanging. Yet the
          crime is the same.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“blessings of Christianity”</span> do not
          seem to have made any appreciable advance on the morals of the
          converted Pagans.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above is not
          a defence of Pagan Gods, nor is it an attack on the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg507"></a> Christian Deity, nor does it mean
          belief in either. The writer is quite impartial, and rejects the
          testimony in favour of both, neither praying to, believing in, nor
          dreading any such <span class="tei tei-q">“personal”</span> and
          anthropomorphic God. The parallels are brought forward simply as
          one more curious exhibition of the illogical and blind fanaticism
          of the civilized theologian. For, so far, there is not a very great
          difference between the two beliefs, and there is none in their
          respective effects upon <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morality</span></em>, or spiritual nature. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“light of Christ”</span> shines upon as
          hideous features of the animal man now, as the <span class="tei tei-q">“light of Lucifer”</span> did in days of old. Says the
          missionary Lavoisier, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal des Colonies</span></span>:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">These unfortunate heathens in their superstition
          regard even the Elements as something that has comprehension!...
          They still have faith in their idol Vâyu—the God or, rather, Demon
          of the Wind and Air ... they firmly believe in the efficacy of
          their prayers, and in the powers of their Brâhmans over the winds
          and storms.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reply to
          this, we may quote from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Luke</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“And he [Jesus] arose and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">rebuked the wind and
          the raging of the water, and they ceased and there was a
          calm</span></span>.”</span><a href="#note_780" id="noteref_780" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a> And
          here is another quotation from a Prayer Book: <span class="tei tei-q">“O Virgin of the Sea, blessed Mother and Lady of the
          Waters, stay thy waves.”</span> This prayer of the Neapolitan and
          Provençal sailors, is copied textually from that of the Phœnician
          mariners to their Virgin-Goddess Astarte. The logical and
          irrepressible conclusion arising from the parallels brought
          forward, and the denunciation of the missionary, is that the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">commands</span></em> of the Brâhmans to their
          Element-Gods <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not remaining</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“ineffectual,”</span> the power of the Brâhmans is thus
          placed on a par with that of Jesus. Moreover, Astarte is shown not
          a whit weaker in potency than the <span class="tei tei-q">“Virgin
          of the Sea”</span> of Christian sailors. It is not enough to give a
          dog a bad name, and then hang him; the dog has to be proven guilty.
          Boreas and Astarte may be <span class="tei tei-q">“Devils”</span>
          in theological fancy, but, as just remarked, the tree has to be
          judged by its fruit. And once the Christians are shown to be as
          immoral and as wicked as the Pagans ever were, what benefit has
          Humanity derived from its change of Gods and Idols?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which God
          and the Christian Saints are justified in doing, becomes in simple
          mortals a crime, if successful. Sorcery and incantations are now
          regarded as fables; yet from the Institutes of Justinian down to
          the laws of England and America against witchcraft—obsolete
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page508">[pg 508]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg508"></a> but not repealed to
          this day—such incantations, even when only suspected, were punished
          as criminal. Why punish a chimera? And still we read of
          Constantine, the Emperor, sentencing to death the philosopher
          Sopatrus for <span class="tei tei-q">“unchaining the winds,”</span>
          and thus preventing ships laden with grain from arriving in time to
          put an end to famine. Pausanias is derided when he affirms that he
          saw with his own eyes <span class="tei tei-q">“men who by simple
          prayers and incantations”</span> stopped a strong hail-storm. This
          does not prevent modern Christian writers from advising prayer
          during storm and danger, and believing in its efficacy. Hoppo and
          Stadlein, two magicians and sorcerers, were sentenced to death for
          <span class="tei tei-q">“throwing charms on fruit”</span> and
          transferring a harvest by magic arts from one field to another,
          hardly a century ago, if we can believe Sprenger, the famous
          writer, who vouches for it: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Qui fruges
          excantassent segetem pellicentes
          incantando</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us close by
          reminding the reader that, without the smallest shadow of
          superstition, one may believe in the dual nature of every object on
          Earth, in spiritual and material, in visible and invisible Nature,
          and that Science virtually proves this, while denying its own
          demonstration. For if, as Sir William Grove says, the electricity
          we handle is but the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">result</span></em> of ordinary matter affected
          by something invisible, the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ultimate</span></em> generating power”</span>
          of every Force, the <span class="tei tei-q">“one omnipresent
          influence,”</span> then it only becomes natural that one should
          believe as the Ancients did; namely, that every Element is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dual</span></em> in its nature. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ethereal Fire is the emanation of the Kabir proper;
          the Aërial is but the union [correlation] of the former with
          Terrestrial Fire, and its guidance and application on our earthly
          plane belongs to a Kabir of a lesser dignity”</span>—an Elemental,
          perhaps, as an Occultist would call it; and the same may be said of
          every Cosmic Element.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No one will deny
          that the human being is possessed of various forces, magnetic,
          sympathetic, antipathetic, nervous, dynamical, occult, mechanical,
          mental, in fact of every kind of force; and that the physical
          forces are all biological in their essence, seeing that they
          intermingle with, and often merge into, those forces that we have
          named intellectual and moral, the first being the vehicles, so to
          say, the upâdhis, of the second. No one, who does not deny soul in
          man, would hesitate in saying that their presence and commingling
          are the very essence of our being; that they constitute the Ego in
          man, in fact. These potencies have their physiological, physical,
          mechanical, as well as their nervous, ecstatic, clairaudient, and
          clairvoyant phenomena, which are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg509"></a> now regarded and recognized as perfectly
          natural, even by Science. Why should man be the only exception in
          Nature, and why cannot even the Elements have their Vehicles, their
          Vâhanas, in what we call the Physical Forces? And why, above all,
          should such beliefs be called <span class="tei tei-q">“superstition”</span> along with the religions of
          old?</p>

          Kwan-Yin.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Like
          Avalokiteshvara, Kwan-Shi-Yin has passed through several
          transformations, but it is an error to say of him that he is a
          modern invention of the Northern Buddhists, for under another
          appellation he has been known from the earliest times. The Secret
          Doctrine teaches that: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">He who is the first
          to appear at Renovation will be the last to come before
          Reäbsorption</span></span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pralaya</span></span>]”</span>. Thus the Logoi
          of all nations, from the Vedic Vishvakarman of the Mysteries down
          to the Saviour of the present civilized nations, are the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Word”</span> who was in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Beginning,”</span> or the reäwakening of the
          energizing Powers of Nature, with the One <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Absolute</span></span>. Born of Fire and
          Water, before these became distinct Elements, It was the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Maker,”</span> the fashioner or modeller,
          of all things. <span class="tei tei-q">“Without him was not
          anything made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the
          light of men,”</span> who finally may be called as he ever has
          been, the Alpha and the Omega of Manifested Nature. <span class="tei tei-q">“The great Dragon of Wisdom is born of Fire and Water,
          and into Fire and Water will all be reäbsorbed with
          him.”</span><a href="#note_781" id="noteref_781" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> As
          this Bodhisattva is said <span class="tei tei-q">“to assume any
          form he pleases,”</span> from the beginning of a Manvantara to its
          end, though his special birthday, or memorial day, is celebrated
          according to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Kin-kwang-ming-King</span></span>, or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Luminous Sûtra of Golden Light,”</span> in
          the second month on the nineteenth day, and that of Maitreya
          Buddha, in the first month on the first day, yet the two are one.
          He will appear as Maitreya Buddha, the last of the Avatâras and
          Buddhas, in the Seventh Race. This belief and expectation are
          universal throughout the East. Only it is not in the Kali Yuga, our
          present terrifically materialistic age of Darkness, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Black Age,”</span> that a new Saviour of
          Humanity can ever appear. The Kali Yuga is <span class="tei tei-q">“l'Age d'Or”</span> (!) only in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mystic</span></em>
          writings of some French pseudo-Occultists.<a href="#note_782" id="noteref_782" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page511">[pg 511]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg511"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence the ritual
          in the exoteric worship of this Deity was founded on magic. The
          Mantras are all taken from special books kept secret by the
          priests, and each is said to work a magical effect; as the reciter
          or reader, by simply chanting them, produces a secret causation
          which results in immediate effects. Kwan-Shi-Yin is
          Avalokiteshvara, and both are forms of the Seventh Universal
          Principle; while in its highest metaphysical character this Deity
          is the synthetic aggregation of all the Planetary Spirits, Dhyân
          Chohans. He is the <span class="tei tei-q">“Self-Manifested”</span>; in short, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Son of the Father.”</span> Crowned with seven dragons,
          above his statue there appears the inscription Pu-tsi-k'iun-ling,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the universal Saviour of all living
          beings.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course the
          name given in the archaic volume of the Stanzas is quite different,
          but Kwan-Yin is a perfect equivalent. In a temple of P'u-to, the
          sacred island of the Buddhists in China, Kwan-Shi-Yin is
          represented floating on a black aquatic bird (Kâlahamsa), and
          pouring on the heads of mortals the elixir of life, which, as it
          flows, is transformed into one of the chief Dhyâni-Buddhas, the
          Regent of a star called the <span class="tei tei-q">“Star of
          Salvation.”</span> In his third transformation Kwan-Yin is the
          informing Spirit or Genius of Water. In China the Dalaï-Lama is
          believed to be an incarnation of Kwan-Shi-Yin, who in his third
          terrestrial appearance was a Bodhisattva, while the Teshu Lama is
          an incarnation of Amitâbha Buddha, or Gautama.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
          remarked <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">en passant</span></span> that a writer must
          indeed have a diseased imagination to discover phallic worship
          everywhere, as do McClatchey and Hargrave Jennings. The first
          discovers <span class="tei tei-q">“the old phallic gods,
          represented under two evident symbols, the Kheen or Yang, which is
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">membrum virile</span></span>, and the Khw-an
          or Yin, the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pudendum muliebre</span></span>.”</span><a href="#note_783" id="noteref_783" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">783</span></span></a> Such
          a rendering seems the more strange as Kwan-Shi-Yin
          (Avalokiteshvara) and Kwan-Yin, besides being now the patron
          Deities of the Buddhist ascetics, the Yogîs of Tibet, are the Gods
          of chastity, and are, in their esoteric meaning, not even that
          which is implied in the rendering of Mr. Rhys Davids' <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddhism</span></span>: <span class="tei tei-q">“The name Avalokiteshvara ... means <span class="tei tei-q">‘the Lord who looks down from on
          high’</span>.”</span><a href="#note_784" id="noteref_784" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">784</span></span></a> Nor
          is Kwan-Shi-Yin the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of the Buddhas
          present in the Church,”</span> but, literally interpreted, it means
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord that is seen.”</span> and in one
          sense, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Divine Self perceived by
          Self”</span>—the human Self—that is, the Âtman or Seventh
          Principle, merged in the Universal, perceived by, or the object of
          perception to, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page512">[pg
          512]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg512"></a>
          Buddhi, the Sixth Principle, or Divine Soul in man. In a still
          higher sense, Avalokiteshvara-Kwan-Shi-Yin, referred to as the
          seventh Universal Principle, is the Logos perceived by the
          Universal Buddhi, or Soul, as the synthetic aggregate of the
          Dhyâni-Buddhas; and is not the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit of
          Buddha present in the Church,”</span> but the Omnipresent Universal
          Spirit manifested in the temple of Kosmos or Nature. This
          Orientalistic etymology of Kwan and Yin is on a par with that of
          Yoginî, which, we are told by Mr. Hargrave Jennings, is a Sanskrit
          word, <span class="tei tei-q">“in the dialects pronounced Jogi or
          Zogee (!), and is ... equivalent with Sena, and exactly the same as
          Duti or Dutica,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, a sacred prostitute of the
          temple, worshipped as Yoni or Shakti.<a href="#note_785" id="noteref_785" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“The books of morality [in India] direct a
          faithful wife to shun the society of Yogini or females who have
          been adored as Sacti.”</span><a href="#note_786" id="noteref_786" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a>
          Nothing should surprise us after this. And it is, therefore, with
          hardly a smile that we find another preposterous absurdity quoted
          about <span class="tei tei-q">“Budh,”</span> as being a name
          <span class="tei tei-q">“which signifies not only the sun as the
          source of generation but also the male organ.”</span><a href="#note_787" id="noteref_787" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> Max
          Müller, in treating of <span class="tei tei-q">“False
          Analogies,”</span> says that <span class="tei tei-q">“the most
          celebrated Chinese scholar of his time, Abel Rémusat ... maintains
          that the three syllables I Hi Wei [in the fourteenth chapter of the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Tao-te-King</span></span>] were meant for
          Je-ho-vah”</span>;<a href="#note_788" id="noteref_788" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a> and
          again, Father Amyot <span class="tei tei-q">“felt certain that the
          three persons of the Trinity could be recognized”</span> in the
          same work. And if Abel Rémusat, why not Hargrave Jennings? Every
          scholar will recognize the absurdity of ever seeing in Budh, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“enlightened”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“awakened,”</span> a <span class="tei tei-q">“phallic
          symbol.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Kwan-Shi-Yin,
          then, is <span class="tei tei-q">“the Son identical with his
          Father,”</span> mystically, or the Logos, the Word. He is called
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Dragon of Wisdom,”</span> in Stanza
          III, for all the Logoi of all the ancient religious systems are
          connected with, and symbolized by, serpents. In old Egypt, the God
          Nahbkoon, <span class="tei tei-q">“he who unites the
          doubles,”</span> was represented as a serpent on human legs, either
          with or without arms. This was the Astral Light reüniting by its
          dual physiological and spiritual potency the Divine-Human to its
          purely Divine Monad, the Prototype in <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven”</span> or Nature. It was the emblem of the
          resurrection of Nature; of Christ with the Ophites; and of Jehovah
          as the brazen serpent healing those who looked at him. The serpent
          was also an emblem of Christ with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page513">[pg 513]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg513"></a> the Templars, as is shown by the Templar
          degree in Masonry. The symbol of Knooph (Khnoom also), or the Soul
          of the World, says Champollion, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
          represented among other forms under that of a huge serpent on human
          legs; this reptile, being the emblem of the Good Genius and the
          veritable Agathodæmon, is sometimes bearded.”</span><a href="#note_789" id="noteref_789" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> This
          sacred animal is thus identical with the serpent of the Ophites,
          and is figured on a great number of engraved stones, called Gnostic
          or Basilidean gems. It appears with various heads, human and
          animal, but its gems are always found inscribed with the name
          ΧΝΟΥΒΙΣ (ChNOUBIS). This symbol is identical with one which;
          according to Jamblichus and Champollion, was called the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“First of the Celestial Gods,”</span> the
          God Hermes, or Mercury, with the Greeks, to which God Hermes
          Trismegistus attributes the invention of, and the first initiation
          of men into, Magic; and Mercury is Budh, Wisdom, Enlightenment, or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Reäwakening”</span> into the divine
          Science.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To close,
          Kwan-Shi-Yin and Kwan-Yin are the two aspects, male and female, of
          the same principle in Kosmos, Nature and Man, of Divine Wisdom and
          Intelligence. They are the Christos-Sophia of the mystic Gnostics,
          the Logos and its Shakti. In their longing for the expression of
          some mysteries never to be wholly comprehended by the profane, the
          Ancients, knowing that nothing could be preserved in human memory
          without some outward symbol, have chosen the, to us, often
          ridiculous images of the Kwan-Yins to remind man of his origin and
          inner nature. To the impartial, however, the Madonnas in crinolines
          and the Christs in white kid gloves must appear far more absurd
          than the Kwan-Shi-Yin and Kwan-Yin in their dragon-garb. The
          subjective can hardly be expressed by the objective. Therefore,
          since the symbolic formula attempts to characterize that which is
          above scientific reasoning, and is as often far beyond our
          intellects, it must needs go beyond that intellect in some shape or
          other, or else it will fade out from human remembrance.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Section I. Reasons for These
          Addenda.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many of the
          doctrines contained in the foregoing seven Stanzas and Commentaries
          having been studied and critically examined by some Western
          Theosophists, certain of the Occult Teachings have been found
          wanting from the ordinary stand-point of modern scientific
          knowledge. They seemed to encounter insuperable difficulties in the
          way of their acceptance, and to require reconsideration in view of
          scientific criticism. Some friends have already been tempted to
          regret the necessity of so often calling in question the assertions
          of Modern Science. It appeared to them—and I here repeat only their
          arguments—that <span class="tei tei-q">“to run counter to the
          teachings of its most eminent exponents, was to court a premature
          discomfiture in the eyes of the Western World.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is,
          therefore, desirable to define, once and for all, the position
          which the writer, who does not in this agree with her friends,
          intends to maintain. So far as Science remains what in the words of
          Prof. Huxley it is, viz., <span class="tei tei-q">“organized common
          sense”</span>; so far as its inferences are drawn from accurate
          premisses, its generalizations resting on a purely inductive basis,
          every Theosophist and Occultist welcomes respectfully and with due
          admiration its contributions to the domain of cosmological law.
          There can be no possible conflict between the teachings of Occult
          and so-called exact Science, wherever the conclusions of the latter
          are grounded on a substratum of unassailable fact. It is only when
          its more ardent exponents, over-stepping the limits of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page518">[pg 518]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg518"></a> observed phenomena in order to
          penetrate into the arcana of Being, attempt to wrench the formation
          of Kosmos and its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></em> Forces from Spirit, and to
          attribute all to blind Matter, that the Occultists claim the right
          of disputing and calling in question their theories. Science
          cannot, owing to the very nature of things, unveil the mystery of
          the Universe around us. Science can, it is true, collect, classify,
          and generalize upon phenomena; but the Occultist, arguing from
          admitted metaphysical data, declares that the daring explorer, who
          would probe the inmost secrets of Nature, must transcend the narrow
          limitations of sense, and transfer his consciousness into the
          region of Noumena and the sphere of Primal Causes. To effect this,
          he must develop faculties which, save in a few rare and exceptional
          cases, are absolutely dormant, in the constitution of the
          off-shoots of our present Fifth Root-Race in Europe and America. He
          can in no other conceivable manner collect the facts on which to
          base his speculations. Is this not apparent on the principles of
          Inductive Logic and Metaphysics alike?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other
          hand, whatever the writer may do, she will never be able to satisfy
          both Truth and Science. To offer the reader a systematic and
          uninterrupted version of the Archaic Stanzas is impossible. A gap
          of 43 verses or shlokas has to be left between the 7th, already
          given, and the 51st, which is the subject of Book II, though the
          latter are made to run as from 1 onwards, for easier reading and
          reference. The mere appearance of man on Earth occupies an equal
          number of Stanzas, which minutely describe his primal evolution
          from the human Dhyân Chohans, the state of the Globe at that time,
          etc., etc. A great number of names referring to chemical substances
          and other compounds, which have now ceased to combine together, and
          are therefore unknown to the later offshoots of our Fifth Race,
          occupy a considerable space. As they are simply untranslatable, and
          would remain in every case inexplicable, they are omitted, along
          with those which cannot be made public. Nevertheless, even the
          little that is given will irritate every follower and defender of
          dogmatic materialistic Science who happens to read it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In view of the
          criticism offered, it is proposed, before proceeding to the
          remaining Stanzas, to defend those already given. That they are not
          in perfect accord or harmony with Modern Science, we all know. But
          had they been as much in agreement with the views of modern
          knowledge as is a lecture by Sir William Thomson, they would have
          been rejected all the same. For they teach belief in conscious
          Powers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page519">[pg
          519]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg519"></a>
          and Spiritual Entities; in terrestrial, semi-intelligent, and
          highly intellectual Forces on other planes;<a href="#note_790" id="noteref_790" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> and
          in Beings that dwell around us in spheres imperceptible, whether
          through telescope or microscope. Hence the necessity of examining
          the beliefs of materialistic Science, of comparing its views about
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elements”</span> with the opinions of
          the Ancients, and of analysing the physical Forces as they exist in
          modern conceptions, before the Occultists admit themselves to be in
          the wrong. We shall touch upon the constitution of the Sun and
          planets, and the Occult characteristics of what are called Devas
          and Genii, and are now termed by Science, Forces, or <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of motion,”</span> and see whether Esoteric
          belief is defensible or not. Notwithstanding the efforts made to
          the contrary, an unprejudiced mind will discover that under
          Newton's <span class="tei tei-q">“agent, material or
          immaterial,”</span><a href="#note_791" id="noteref_791" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a> the
          agent which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes gravity</span></em>, and in his
          personal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">working</span></em> God, there is just as much
          of the metaphysical Devas and Genii, as there is in Kepler's
          Angelus Rector conducting each planet, and in the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">species
          immateriata</span></span> by which the celestial bodies were
          carried along in their courses, according to that Astronomer.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Volume II, we
          shall have to openly approach dangerous subjects. We must bravely
          face Science and declare, in the teeth of materialistic learning,
          of Idealism, Hylo-Idealism, Positivism and all-denying modern
          Psychology, that the true Occultist believes in <span class="tei tei-q">“Lords of Light”</span>; that he believes in a Sun,
          which—far from being simply a <span class="tei tei-q">“lamp of
          day”</span> moving in accordance with physical law, and far from
          being merely one of those Suns, which, according to Richter,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“are sun-flowers of a higher
          light”</span>—is, like milliards of other Suns, the dwelling or the
          vehicle of a God, and of a host of Gods.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this dispute,
          of course, it is the Occultists who will be worsted. They will be
          considered, on the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">primâ facie</span></span> aspect of the
          question, to be ignoramuses, and will be labelled with more than
          one of the usual epithets given to those whom the superficially
          judging public, itself ignorant of the great underlying truths in
          Nature, accuses of believing in mediæval superstitions. Let it be
          so. Submitting beforehand to every criticism in order to go on with
          their task, they only claim the privilege of showing that the
          Physicists are as much at loggerheads among themselves in their
          speculations, as these speculations are with the teachings of
          Occultism.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page520">[pg
          520]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg520"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Sun is
          Matter, and the Sun is Spirit. Our ancestors, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Heathen,”</span> like their modern successors, the
          Parsîs, were, and are, wise enough in their generation to see in it
          the symbol of Divinity, and at the same time to sense within,
          concealed by the physical symbol, the bright God of Spiritual and
          Terrestrial Light. Such belief can be regarded as a superstition
          only by rank Materialism, which denies Deity, Spirit, Soul, and
          admits no intelligence outside the mind of man. But if too much
          wrong superstition bred by <span class="tei tei-q">“Churchianity,”</span> as Laurence Oliphant calls it,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“renders a man a fool,”</span> too much
          scepticism makes him mad. We prefer the charge of folly in
          believing too much, to that of a madness which denies everything,
          as do Materialism and Hylo-Idealism. Hence, the Occultists are
          fully prepared to receive their dues from Materialism, and to meet
          the adverse criticism which will be poured on the author of this
          work, not for writing it, but for believing in that which it
          contains.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore the
          discoveries, hypotheses, and unavoidable objections which will be
          brought forward by the scientific critics must be anticipated and
          disposed of. It has also to be shown how far the Occult Teachings
          depart from Modern Science, and whether the ancient or the modern
          theories are the more logically and philosophically correct. The
          unity and mutual relations of all parts of Kosmos were known to the
          Ancients, before they became evident to modern Astronomers and
          Philosophers. And even if the external and visible portions of the
          Universe, and their mutual relations, cannot be explained in
          Physical Science, in any other terms than those used by the
          adherents of the mechanical theory of the Universe, it does not
          follow that the Materialist, who denies that the Soul of Kosmos
          (which appertains to Metaphysical Philosophy) exists, has the right
          to trespass upon that metaphysical domain. That Physical Science is
          trying to, and actually does, encroach upon it, is only one more
          proof that <span class="tei tei-q">“might is right”</span>; it does
          not justify the intrusion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another good
          reason for these Addenda is this. Since only a certain portion of
          the Secret Teachings can be given out in the present age, the
          doctrines would never be understood even by Theosophists, if they

          most, be only temporary. People have laughed at everything unusual,

          by accepting it. Materialism and Scepticism are evils that must
          remain in the world so long as man has not quitted his present

          are equilibrated by Intuition and a natural Spirituality, every
          being afflicted with such feelings will see in himself nothing
          better than a bundle of flesh, bones, and muscles, with an empty
          garret inside, which serves the purpose of storing his sensations
          and feelings. Sir Humphrey Davy was a great Scientist, as deeply

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now
          Occultism puts to Science the question: Is light a body, or is it
          not? Whatever the answer of the latter, the former is prepared to
          show that, to this day, the most eminent Physicists have no real
          knowledge on the subject. To know what light is, and whether it is
          an actual substance or a mere undulation of the <span class="tei tei-q">“ethereal medium,”</span> Science has first to learn
          what Matter, Atom, Ether, Force, are in reality. Now, the truth is,
          that it knows nothing of any of these, and admits its ignorance. It
          has not even agreed what to believe in, as dozens of hypotheses on
          the same subject, emanating from various and very eminent
          Scientists, are antagonistic to each other and often
          self-contradictory. Thus their learned speculations may, with a
          stretch of good-will, be accepted as <span class="tei tei-q">“working hypotheses”</span> in a secondary sense, as
          Stallo puts it. But being radically inconsistent with each other,
          they must finally end by mutually destroying themselves. As
          declared by the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Concepts of Modem Physics</span></span>:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It must not be forgotten that the several
          departments of science are simply arbitrary divisions of science at
          large. In these several departments the same physical object may be
          considered under different aspects. The physicist may study its
          molecular relations, while the chemist determines its atomic
          constitution. But when they both deal with the same element or
          agent, it cannot have one set of properties in physics, and another
          set contradictory of them, in chemistry. If the physicist and
          chemist alike assume the existence of ultimate atoms absolutely
          invariable in bulk and weight, the atom cannot be a cube or oblate
          spheroid for physical, and a sphere for chemical purposes. A group
          of constant atoms cannot be an aggregate of extended and absolutely
          inert and impenetrable masses in a crucible or retort, and a system
          of mere centres of force as part of a magnet or of a Clamond

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The eminent

          assigned to this unique being, the foundation of all that exists.
          Now, from the first examination of the particular systems proposed,
          one finds the strangest deception; one perceives that the atom of
          the chemist, the atom of the physicist, that of the metaphysician,
          and that of the mathematician ... have absolutely nothing in common
          but the name! The inevitable result is the existing subdivision of
          our sciences, each of which, in its own little pigeon-hole,
          constructs an atom which satisfies the requirements of the
          phenomena it studies, without troubling itself in the least about
          the requirements proper to the phenomena of the neighbouring
          pigeon-hole. The metaphysician banishes the principles of
          attraction and repulsion as dreams; the mathematician, who analyses
          the laws of elasticity and those of the propagation of light,
          admits them implicitly, without even naming them.... The chemist

          There is no agreement even in one and the same science as to the

            indebted, to Sir William Grove. It was he who in a lecture at the

            Science divorced from such <span class="tei tei-q">“dreams,”</span> tortured and often ignored in the
            maze of contradictory theories and hypotheses. A very good
            corroboration of this charge lies in the fact that Science finds
            itself absolutely compelled to accept the <span class="tei tei-q">“hypothetical”</span> Ether, and to try to explain it
            on the materialistic grounds of atomo-mechanical laws. This
            attempt has led directly to the most fatal discrepancies and
            radical inconsistencies <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg

            between the assumed nature of Ether and its physical behaviour. A
            second proof is found in the many contradictory statements made
            about the Atom—the most metaphysical object in creation.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, what does
            the modern science of Physics know of Ether, the first concept of
            which belongs undeniably to ancient Philosophers, the Greeks
            having borrowed it from the Âryans, and the origin of modern
            Ether being found in, and disfigured from, Âkâsha? This
            disfigurement is claimed as a modification and refinement of the
            idea of Lucretius. Let us then examine the modern concept, from
            several scientific volumes containing the admissions of the
            Physicists themselves.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Stallo

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Stallo then
            points out the change caused by the kinetic theories; that from
            the date of the dynamical theory of heat, Ether was chosen in
            Optics as a substratum for luminous undulations. Next, in order
            to explain the dispersion and polarization of light, Physicists
            had to resort once more to their <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific imagination,”</span> and forthwith
            endowed the Ether with (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) atomic or molecular
            structure, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) with an enormous
            elasticity, <span class="tei tei-q">“so that its resistance to
            deformation far exceeded that of the most rigid elastic

            essential discontinuity of Matter</span></em>, hence of Ether.
            After having accepted this discontinuity, in order to account for
            dispersion and polarization, theoretical impossibilities were
            discovered with regard to such dispersion. Cauchy's <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific imagination”</span> saw in Atoms
            <span class="tei tei-q">“material points without
            extension,”</span> and he proposed, in order to obviate the most
            formidable obstacles to the undulatory theory (namely, some
            well-known mechanical theorems which stood in the way), to assume
            that the ethereal medium of propagation, instead of being
            continuous, should consist of particles separated by sensible
            distances. Fresnel rendered the same service to the phenomena of
            polarization. E. B. Hunt upset the theories of both.<a href="#note_800" id="noteref_800" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">800</span></span></a>

            <span class="tei tei-q">“atomo-mechanicalists”</span>—cling to
            them with desperate tenacity. The supposition of an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">atomic</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">molecular
            constitution</span></em> of Ether is upset, moreover, by
            thermo-dynamics, for Clerk Maxwell showed that such a medium
            would be simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">gas</span></em>.<a href="#note_801" id="noteref_801" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a> The
            hypothesis of <span class="tei tei-q">“finite intervals”</span>
            is thus proven of no avail as a supplement to the undulatory
            theory. Besides, eclipses fail to reveal any such variation of
            colour as is supposed by Cauchy, on the assumption that the
            chromatic rays are propagated with different velocities.
            Astronomy has pointed out more than one phenomenon absolutely at

            the Esoteric Teaching in the very arsenal of Modern Science. The

            plane of perception and being, and it can neither be analyzed by
            scientific apparatus, nor appreciated or even conceived by the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“scientific imagination,”</span> unless
            the possessors thereof study the Occult Sciences. That which
            follows proves this statement.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clearly
            demonstrated by Stallo as regards the crucial problems of modern
            Physics, as was done by De Quatrefages and several others in
            those of Anthropology, Biology, etc., that, in their efforts to
            support their individual hypotheses and systems, most of the
            eminent and learned Materialists very often utter the greatest
            fallacies. Let us take the following case. Most of them reject
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span>—one of the
            fundamental principles in the question of Æther or Âkâsha in
            Occultism—while, as Stallo justly observes, there is no physical
            action <span class="tei tei-q">“which, on close examination, does
            not resolve itself into <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">actio in
            distans</span></span>”</span>; and he proves it.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now,
            metaphysical arguments, according to Professor Lodge,<a href="#note_803" id="noteref_803" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a> are
            <span class="tei tei-q">“unconscious appeals to
            experience.”</span> And he adds that if such an experience
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not
            conceivable</span></em>, then it does not exist. In his own
            words:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And thereupon,
            toward the end of his lecture, the Professor indicates that the
            explanation of cohesion, as well as of gravity, <span class="tei tei-q">“is to be looked for in the vortex-atom theory of Sir
            William Thomson.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless
            to stop to inquire whether it is to this vortex-atom theory,
            also, that we have to look for the dropping down on earth of the
            first life-germ by a passing meteor or comet—Sir William
            Thomson's hypothesis. But Prof. Lodge might be reminded of the
            wise criticism on his lecture in Stallo's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Concepts of Modem
            Physics</span></span>. Noticing the above-quoted declaration by
            the Professor, the author asks</p>

            theory are familiar, or even possible, facts of experience? For,
            if they are not, clearly that theory is obnoxious to the same
            criticism which is said to invalidate the assumption of</span>

            able critic shows clearly what the Ether is not, nor can ever be,
            notwithstanding all scientific claims to the contrary. And thus
            he opens widely, if unconsciously, the entrance door to our
            Occult Teachings. For, as he says:</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page530">[pg 530]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg530"></a>

              Hence this theory, instead of being, as is claimed, a reduction

              the contrary, a reduction of a fact which is perfectly

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A <span class="tei tei-q">“phantom,”</span> indeed, which can be made
            apprehensible only by Occultism. From such scientific Metaphysics
            to Occultism there is hardly one step. Those Physicists who hold
            the view that the atomic constitution of Matter is consistent
            with its penetrability, need not go far out of their way to be
            able to account for the greatest phenomena of Occultism, now so
            derided by Physical Scientists and Materialists. Cauchy's
            <span class="tei tei-q">“material points without

            extension, as a chief factor in phenomenal manifestations, ought
            to suggest themselves very easily as a clear possibility, at any
            rate to those few scientific minds <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg531"></a> which accept M. Cauchy's views. For,
            disposing of that property of Matter which they call
            impenetrability, by simply regarding the Atoms as <span class="tei tei-q">“material points exerting on each other attractions
            and repulsions which vary with the distances that separate
            them,”</span> the French theorist explains that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">From this it follows that, if it pleased the
            author of nature simply to modify the laws according to which the
            atoms attract or repel each other, we might instantly see the
            hardest bodies penetrating each other, the smallest particles of
            matter occupying immense spaces, or the largest masses reducing
            themselves to the smallest volumes, the entire universe
            concentrating itself, as it were, in a single
              point.</span><a href="#note_809" id="noteref_809" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a></p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Section III. Is Gravitation a
          Law?</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The corpuscular
          theory has been unceremoniously put aside; but gravitation—the
          principle that all bodies attract each other with a force
          proportional directly to their masses, and inversely to the squares
          of the distances between them—survives to this day and reigns,
          supreme as ever, in the alleged ethereal waves of Space. As a
          hypothesis, it had been threatened with death for its inadequacy to
          embrace all the facts presented to it; as a physical law, it is the
          King of the late and once all-potent <span class="tei tei-q">“Imponderables.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“It is
          little short of blasphemy ... an insult to Newton's grand memory to
          doubt it!”</span>—is the exclamation of an American reviewer of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span>. Well; what is finally that invisible and
          intangible God in whom we should believe on blind faith?
          Astronomers who see in gravitation an easy-going solution for many
          things, and a universal force which allows them to calculate
          planetary motions, care little about the Cause of Attraction. They
          call Gravity a law, a cause in itself. We call the forces acting
          under that name effects, and very secondary effects, too. One day
          it will be found that the scientific hypothesis does not answer
          after all; and then it will follow the corpuscular theory of light,
          and be consigned to rest for many scientific æons in the archives
          of all exploded speculations. Has not Newton himself expressed
          grave doubts about the nature of Force and the corporeality of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Agents,”</span> as they were then called?
          So has Cuvier, another scientific light shining in the night of
          research. He warns his readers, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Révolution du
          Globe</span></span>, about the doubtful nature of the so-called
          Forces, saying that <span class="tei tei-q">“it is not so sure
          whether those agents were not after all Spiritual Powers
          [<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">des
          agents spirituels</span></span>].”</span> At the outset of his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Principia</span></span>, Sir Isaac Newton took
          the greatest care to impress upon his school that he did not use
          the word <span class="tei tei-q">“attraction,”</span> with regard
          to the mutual action of bodies in a physical sense. To him it was,
          he said, a purely mathematical conception, involving no
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page533">[pg 533]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg533"></a> consideration of
          real and primary physical causes. In a passage of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Principia</span></span>,<a href="#note_810" id="noteref_810" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a> he
          tells us plainly that, physically considered, attractions are
          rather impulses. In Section xi (Introduction), he expresses the
          opinion that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is some subtle spirit
          by the force and action of which all movements of matter are
          determined”</span>;<a href="#note_811" id="noteref_811" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a> and
          in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Third Letter</span></span> to Bentley he
          says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It is inconceivable that inanimate brute matter
          should, without the mediation of something else</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">which is not
          material</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, operate upon and
          affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if
          gravitation, in the sense of Epicurus, be essential and inherent in
          it.... That gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to
          matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance,
          through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else by and
          through which their action may be conveyed from one to another, is
          to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man, who has in
          philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever
          fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly
          according to certain laws; but</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">whether this agent be material
          or immaterial</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">I have left
          to the consideration of my readers.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this, even
          Newton's contemporaries got frightened—at the apparent return of
          Occult Causes into the domain of Physics. Leibnitz called his
          principle of attraction <span class="tei tei-q">“an incorporeal and
          inexplicable power.”</span> The supposition of an attractive
          faculty and a perfect void was characterized by Bernoulli as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“revolting,”</span> the principle of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">actio in distans</span></span> finding then no
          more favour than it does now. Euler, on the other hand, thought the
          action of gravity was due to either a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit</span></span>
          or some subtle medium. And yet Newton knew of, if he did not
          accept, the Ether of the Ancients. He regarded the intermediate
          space between the sidereal bodies as vacuum. Therefore he believed
          in <span class="tei tei-q">“subtle Spirit”</span> and Spirits as we
          do, guiding the so-called attraction. The above-quoted words of the
          great man have produced poor results. The <span class="tei tei-q">“absurdity”</span> has now become a dogma in the case
          of pure Materialism, which repeats: <span class="tei tei-q">“No
          Matter without Force, no Force without Matter; Matter and Force are
          inseparable, eternal and indestructible [<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>];
          there can be no independent Force, since all Force is an inherent
          and necessary property of Matter [<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">false</span></em>];
          consequently, there is no immaterial Creative Power.”</span> Oh,
          poor Sir Isaac!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, leaving
          aside all the other eminent men of Science who agreed in opinion
          with Euler and Leibnitz, the Occultists claim as their authorities
          and supporters Sir Isaac Newton and Cuvier only, as above cited,
          they need fear little from Modern Science, and may loudly and
          proudly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page534">[pg
          534]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg534"></a>
          proclaim their beliefs. But the hesitation and doubts of the above
          cited authorities, and of many others, too, whom we could name, did
          not in the least prevent scientific speculation from wool-gathering
          in the fields of brute matter just as before. First it was matter
          and an imponderable fluid distinct from it; then came the
          imponderable fluid so much criticized by Grove; then Ether, which
          was at first discontinuous and then became continuous; after which
          came the <span class="tei tei-q">“mechanical”</span> Forces. These
          have now settled in life as <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of
          motion,”</span> and the Ether has become more mysterious and
          problematical than ever. More than one man of Science objects to
          such crude materialistic views. But then, from the days of Plato,
          who repeatedly asks his readers not to confuse <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incorporeal</span></em> Elements with their
          Principles—the transcendental or spiritual Elements; from those of
          the great Alchemists, who, like Paracelsus, made a great difference
          between a phenomenon and its cause, or the Noumenon; to Grove, who,
          though he sees <span class="tei tei-q">“no reason to divest
          universally diffused matter of the functions common to all
          matter,”</span> yet uses the term Forces where his critics,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“who do not attach to the word any idea of
          a specific action,”</span> say Force; from those days to this,
          nothing has proved competent to stem the tide of brutal
          Materialism. Gravitation is the sole cause, the acting God, and
          Matter is its prophet, said the men of Science only a few years
          ago.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They have
          changed their views several times since then. But do the men of
          Science understand the innermost thought of Newton, one of the most
          spiritual-minded and religious men of his day, any better now than
          they did then? It is certainly to be doubted. Newton is credited
          with having given the death-blow to the Elemental Vortices of
          Descartes—the idea of Anaxagoras, resurrected, by the bye—though
          the last modern <span class="tei tei-q">“vortical atoms”</span> of
          Sir William Thomson do not, in truth, differ much from the former.
          Nevertheless, when his disciple Forbes wrote in the Preface to the
          chief work of his master a sentence declaring that <span class="tei tei-q">“attraction was the cause of the system,”</span> Newton
          was the first to solemnly protest. That which in the mind of the
          great mathematician assumed the shadowy, but firmly rooted image of
          God, as the Noumenon of all,<a href="#note_812" id="noteref_812" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a> was
          called more philosophically by ancient and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page535">[pg 535]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg535"></a> modern Philosophers and
          Occultists—<span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> or the creative
          fashioning Powers. The modes of expression may have been different,
          and the ideas more or less philosophically enunciated by all sacred
          and profane Antiquity; but the fundamental thought was the
          same.<a href="#note_813" id="noteref_813" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> For
          Pythagoras the Forces were Spiritual Entities, Gods, independent of
          planets and Matter as we see and know them on Earth, who are the
          rulers of the Sidereal Heaven. Plato represented the planets as
          moved by an intrinsic Rector, one with his dwelling, like
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a boatman in his boat.”</span> As for
          Aristotle, he called those rulers <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">immaterial</span></em>
          substances”</span>;<a href="#note_814" id="noteref_814" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a>
          though as one who had never been initiated, he rejected the Gods as
          Entities.<a href="#note_815" id="noteref_815" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> But
          this did not prevent him from recognizing the fact that the stars
          and planets <span class="tei tei-q">“were not inanimate masses but
          acting and living bodies indeed.”</span> As if sidereal spirits
          were the <span class="tei tei-q">“diviner portions of their
          phenomena (τὰ θειότερα τῶν φανερῶν).”</span><a href="#note_816" id="noteref_816" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we look for
          corroboration in more modern and scientific times, we find Tycho
          Brahe recognizing in the stars a triple force, divine, spiritual
          and vital. Kepler, putting together the Pythagorean sentence,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Sun, guardian of Jupiter,”</span> and
          the verses of David, <span class="tei tei-q">“He placed his throne
          in the Sun,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord is the
          Sun,”</span> etc., said that he understood perfectly how the
          Pythagoreans could believe that all the Globes disseminated through
          Space were rational Intelligences (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">facultates
          ratiocinativæ</span></span>), circulating round the Sun,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“in which resides a pure spirit of fire;
          the source of the general harmony.”</span><a href="#note_817" id="noteref_817" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When an
          Occultist speaks of Fohat, the energizing and guiding Intelligence
          in the Universal Electric or Vital Fluid, he is laughed at.
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page536">[pg 536]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg536"></a> Withal, as now
          shown, the nature neither of electricity, nor of life, nor even of
          light, is to this day understood. The Occultist sees in the
          manifestation of every force in Nature, the action of the quality,
          or the special characteristic of its Noumenon; which Noumenon is a
          distinct and intelligent Individuality <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">on the other side of
          the manifested mechanical Universe</span></span>. Now the Occultist
          does not deny—on the contrary he will support the view—that light,
          heat, electricity and so on are affections, not properties or
          qualities, of Matter. To put it more clearly: Matter is the
          condition, the necessary basis or vehicle, a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sine quâ
          non</span></span>, for the manifestation of these Forces, or
          Agents, on this plane.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But in order to
          gain the point, the Occultists have to examine the credentials of
          the law of gravity, first of all, of <span class="tei tei-q">“Gravitation, the King and Ruler of Matter,”</span>
          under every form. To do so effectually, the hypothesis, in its
          earliest appearance, has to be recalled to mind. To begin with, is
          it Newton who was the first to discover it? The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Athenæum</span></span> of Jan. 26, 1867, has
          some curious information upon this subject. It says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Positive evidence can be adduced that Newton
          derived all his knowledge of Gravitation and its laws from Bœhme,
          with whom Gravitation or Attraction is the first property of
          Nature.... For with him, his [Bœhme's] system shows us the inside
          of things, while modern physical science is content with looking at
          the outside.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then again:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The science of electricity, which was not yet in
          existence when he [Bœhme] wrote, is there anticipated [in his
          writings]; and not only does Bœhme describe all the now known
          phenomena of that force, but he even gives us the origin,
          generation, and birth of electricity, itself.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus Newton,
          whose profound mind easily read between the lines, and fathomed the
          spiritual thought of the great Seer, in its mystic rendering, owes
          his great discovery to Jacob Bœhme, the nursling of the Genii,
          Nirmânakâyas who watched over and guided him, of whom the author of
          the article in question so truly remarks:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Every new scientific discovery goes to prove his
          profound and intuitive insight into the most secret workings of
          Nature.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And having
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">discovered</span></em> gravity, Newton, in
          order to render possible the action of attraction in space, had, so
          to speak, to annihilate every physical obstacle capable of impeding
          its free action; Ether among others, though he had more than a
          presentiment of its existence. Advocating the corpuscular theory,
          he made an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute vacuum</span></em> between the
          heavenly bodies. Whatever may have been his suspicions and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page537">[pg 537]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg537"></a> inner convictions

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Anyhow, it is

          and exposed it. And now Modern Science, however ungracefully,
          vindicates Archaic Knowledge, and has, moreover, to vindicate
          Newton's character and powers of observation at this late hour,
          after having neglected, for one century and a half, to pay any
          attention to such very important passages—perchance, because it was
          wiser not to attract any notice to them. Better late than
          never!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now Father

          when it, or both, shall be replaced by something else. Three
          hundred years ago it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plenum</span></em> everywhere, then it became
          one dismal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vacuity</span></em>; later still the sidereal

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we will not

          for the very backbone and marrow of their correlations and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“newest”</span> discoveries, and this may
          well afford good hope to the Occultists for their minor Gods. For
          we believe in Le Couturier's prophecy about gravitation. We know
          the day is approaching when an absolute reform will be demanded in
          the present modes of Science by the Scientists themselves, as was
          done by Sir William Grove, F.R.S. Till that day there is nothing to
          be done. For if gravitation were dethroned to-morrow, the
          Scientists would discover some other new mode of mechanical motion
          the day after.<a href="#note_822" id="noteref_822" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">822</span></span></a> Rough
          and up-hill is the path of true Science, and its days are full of
          vexation of spirit. But in the face of its <span class="tei tei-q">“thousand”</span> contradictory hypotheses offered as
          explanations of physical phenomena, there has been no better
          hypothesis than <span class="tei tei-q">“motion”</span>—however
          paradoxically interpreted by Materialism. As may be found in the
          first pages of this Volume, Occultists have nothing to say against
          Motion,<a href="#note_823" id="noteref_823" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">823</span></span></a> the

          the shadow of something in Space, they believe in smaller
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Breaths,”</span> which, living,
          intelligent and independent of all but Law, blow in every direction
          during manvantaric periods. These Science will reject. But whatever
          may be made to replace attraction, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alias</span></em>
          gravitation, the result will be the same. Science will be as far
          then from the solution of its difficulties as it is now, unless it
          comes to some compromise with Occultism, and even with Alchemy—a
          supposition which will be regarded as an impertinence, but remains,
          nevertheless, a fact. As Faye says:</p>

          concussion, heat or motion of the particles is generated; and thus
          the motion continues, so that if we could venture to extend such

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, supposing
          attraction or gravitation should be given up in favour of the Sun
          being a huge magnet—a theory already accepted by some Physicists—a
          magnet that acts on the planets as attraction is now supposed to
          do, whereto, or how much farther, would it lead the Astronomers
          from where they are now? Not an inch farther. Kepler came to this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“curious hypothesis”</span> nearly 300
          years ago. He had not discovered the theory of attraction and
          repulsion in Kosmos, for it was known from the days of Empedocles,
          by whom the two opposite forces were called <span class="tei tei-q">“love”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“hate”</span>—words implying the same idea. But Kepler
          gave a pretty fair description of cosmic magnetism. That such
          magnetism exists in Nature, is as certain as that gravitation does
          not; not at any rate, in the way in which it is taught by Science,
          which has never taken into consideration the different modes in
          which the dual Force, that Occultism calls attraction and
          repulsion, may act within our Solar System, the Earth's atmosphere

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">True, that since
          1860 the Nebular Theory has sprung up, and being better known, a
          few identical phenomena were supposed to be observed beyond the
          Solar System. Yet the great man is quite right; and no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earths</span></em>
          or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">moons</span></em> can be found, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except in
          appearance</span></em>, beyond, or of the same order of Matter as
          found in, our System. Such is the Occult Teaching.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was proven
          by Newton himself; for there are many phenomena in our Solar
          System, which he confessed his inability to explain by the law of
          gravitation; <span class="tei tei-q">“such were the uniformity in
          the directions of planetary movements, the nearly circular forms of
          the orbits, and their remarkable conformity to one
          plane.”</span><a href="#note_827" id="noteref_827" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a> And
          if there is one single exception, then the law of gravitation has
          no right to be referred to as a universal law. <span class="tei tei-q">“These adjustments,”</span> we are told, <span class="tei tei-q">“Newton, in his general Scholium, pronounces to be
          <span class="tei tei-q">‘the work of an intelligent and
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page541">[pg 541]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg541"></a> all-powerful
          Being’</span>.”</span> Intelligent that <span class="tei tei-q">“Being”</span> may be; as to <span class="tei tei-q">“all-powerful,”</span> there would be every reason to
          doubt the claim. A poor <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> he,
          who would work upon minor details and leave the most important to
          secondary forces! The poverty of this argument and logic is
          surpassed only by that of Laplace, who, seeking very correctly to
          substitute Motion for Newton's <span class="tei tei-q">“all-powerful Being,”</span> and ignorant of the true
          nature of that Eternal Motion, saw in it a blind physical law.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Might not those arrangements be an effect
          of the laws of motion?”</span> he asks, forgetting, as do all our
          modern Scientists, that this law and this motion are a vicious
          circle, so long as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nature of both</span></em> remains
          unexplained. His famous answer to Napoleon: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Dieu est devenu une hypothèse
          inutile</span></span>,”</span> could be correctly made only by one
          who adhered to the philosophy of the Vedântins. It becomes a pure
          fallacy, if we exclude the interference of operating, intelligent,
          powerful (never <span class="tei tei-q">“all-powerful”</span>)
          Beings, who are called <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we would ask
          the critics of the mediæval Astronomers, why should Kepler be
          denounced as most unscientific, for offering just the same solution
          as did Newton, only showing himself more sincere, more consistent
          and even more logical? Where may be the difference between Newton's
          <span class="tei tei-q">“all-powerful Being”</span> and Kepler's
          Rectores, his Sidereal and Cosmic Forces, or Angels? Kepler again
          is criticized for his <span class="tei tei-q">“curious hypothesis
          which made use of a vortical movement within the solar
          system,”</span> for his theories in general, and for favouring

          modern men of Science, as will be shown—Hunt, if Metcalfe is to be

          constant motion and restoration of the Sun's energy and planetary
          motion, he provided the perpetual care of a Spirit, or Spirits. The
          whole of Antiquity believed in this idea. The Occultists do not use
          the word Spirit, but say Creative Forces, which they endow with
          intelligence. But we may call them Spirits also. We shall be taken
          to task for contradiction. It will be said that while we deny God,
          we admit Souls and operative Spirits, and quote from bigoted Roman
          Catholic writers in support of our argument. To this we reply: We
          deny the anthropomorphic God of the Monotheists, but never the
          Divine Principle in Nature. We combat Protestants and Roman
          Catholics on a number of dogmatic theological beliefs of human and
          sectarian origin. We agree with them in their belief in Spirits and
          intelligent operative Powers, though we do not worship <span class="tei tei-q">“Angels”</span> as the Roman Latinists do.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This theory is
          tabooed a great deal more on account of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirit”</span> that is given room in it, than of
          anything else. Herschell, the elder, believed in it likewise, and
          so do several modern Scientists. Nevertheless Professor Winchell
          declares that <span class="tei tei-q">“a hypothesis more fanciful,
          and less in accord with the requirements of physical principles,
          has not been offered in ancient or modern times.”</span><a href="#note_831" id="noteref_831" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same was
          said, once upon a time, of the universal Ether, and now it is not
          only accepted perforce, but is advocated as the only possible
          theory to explain certain mysteries.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Grove's ideas,
          when he first enunciated them in London about 1840, were denounced
          as unscientific; nevertheless, his views on the Correlation of
          Forces are now universally accepted. It would, very likely, require
          one more conversant with Science than is the writer, to combat with
          any success some of the now prevailing ideas about gravitation and
          other similar <span class="tei tei-q">“solutions”</span> of cosmic
          mysteries. But, let us recall a few objections that came from
          recognized men of Science; from Astronomers and Physicists of
          eminence, who rejected the theory of rotation, as well as that of
          gravitation. Thus one reads in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">French
          Encyclopædia</span></span> that <span class="tei tei-q">“Science
          agrees, in the face of all its representatives, that it is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">impossible</span></em> to explain the

            magnetic force, which acts, just as gravitation does, in a
            straight line, and varies inversely as the square of the
            distance.<a href="#note_844" id="noteref_844" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a></p>

            this, nor the other, can ever help any of the numerous hypotheses
            about the origin and permanency of rotation to escape from this
            squirrel's wheel, any more than can the theory of gravity itself.
            This mystery is the Procrustean bed of Physical Science. If
            Matter is passive, as we are now taught, the simplest movement
            cannot be said to be an essential property of Matter—the latter
            being considered simply as an inert mass. How, then, can such a
            complicated movement, compound and multiple, harmonious and
            equilibrated, lasting in the eternities for millions and millions
            of years, be attributed simply to its own inherent force, unless
            the latter is an Intelligence? A physical will is something new—a
            conception that the Ancients would never have entertained,
            indeed! For over a century all distinction between body and force

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Methinks the
            Count de Maistre was right in solving the question in his own
            theological way. He cuts the Gordian knot by saying:—<span class="tei tei-q">“The planets rotate because they are made to rotate
            ... and the modern physical system of the universe is a physical
            impossibility.”</span><a href="#note_849" id="noteref_849" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> For
            did not Herschell say the same thing when he remarked that there
            is a Will needed to impart a circular motion, and another Will to
            restrain it?<a href="#note_850" id="noteref_850" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a>
            This shows and explains how a retarded planet is cunning enough
            to calculate its time so well as to hit off its arrival at the
            fixed minute. For, if Science sometimes succeeds, with great
            ingenuity, in explaining some of such stoppages, retrograde
            motions, angles outside the orbits, etc., by appearances
            resulting from the inequality of their progress and ours in the
            course of our mutual and respective orbits, we still know that
            there are others, and <span class="tei tei-q">“very real and
            considerable deviations,”</span> according to Herschell,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“which cannot be explained except by the
            mutual and irregular action of those planets and by the
            perturbing influence of the sun.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We understand,
            however, that there are, besides those little and accidental
            perturbations, continuous perturbations called <span class="tei tei-q">“secular”</span>—because of the extreme slowness with
            which the irregularity increases and affects the relations of the
            elliptic movement—and that these perturbations can be corrected.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a series of
            scientific works on Astronomy and the Nebular Theory, written
            between 1865 and 1866, the present writer, a poor tyro in
            Science, has counted in a few hours, no less than thirty-nine
            contradictory hypotheses offered as explanations for the
            self-generated, primitive rotatory motion of the heavenly bodies.
            The writer is no Astronomer, no Mathematician, no Scientist; but
            she was obliged to examine these errors in defence of Occultism,
            in general, and what is still more important, in order to support
            the Occult Teachings concerning Astronomy and Cosmology.
            Occultists were threatened with terrible penalties for
            questioning scientific truths. But now they feel braver; Science
            is less secure in its <span class="tei tei-q">“impregnable”</span> position than they were led to
            expect, and many of its strongholds are built on very shifting
            sands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, even
            this poor and unscientific examination of it has been useful, and
            it has certainly been very instructive. We have learned a good
            many things, in fact, having especially studied with particular
            care those astronomical data, that would be the most likely to
            clash with our heterodox and <span class="tei tei-q">“superstitious”</span> beliefs.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, for
            instance, we have found there, concerning gravitation, the axial
            and orbital motions, that synchronous movement having been once
            overcome, in the early stage, this was enough to originate a
            rotatory motion till the end of Manvantara. We have also come to
            know, in all the aforesaid combinations of possibilities with
            regard to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page550">[pg

            incipient rotation, most complicated in every case, some of the
            causes to which it may have been due, as well as some others to
            which it ought and should have been due, but, in some way or
            other, was not. Among other things, we are informed that
            incipient rotation may be provoked with equal ease in a mass in
            igneous fusion, and in one that is characterized by glacial
            opacity.<a href="#note_855" id="noteref_855" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a>
            That gravitation is a law which nothing can overcome, but which
            is, nevertheless, overcome, in and out of season, by the most
            ordinary celestial or terrestrial bodies—the tails of impudent
            comets, for instance. That we owe the universe to the holy
            Creative Trinity, called Inert Matter, Senseless Force and Blind
            Chance. Of the real essence and nature of any of these three,
            Science knows nothing, but this is a trifling detail. Ergo, we
            are told that, when a mass of cosmic or nebular Matter—whose
            nature is entirely unknown, and which may be in a state of fusion
            (Laplace), or dark and cold (Thomson), for <span class="tei tei-q">“this intervention of heat is itself a pure
            hypothesis”</span> (Faye)—decides to exhibit its mechanical
            energy under the form of rotation, it acts in this wise. It (the
            mass) either bursts into spontaneous conflagration, or it remains
            inert, tenebrous, and frigid, both states being equally capable
            of sending it, without any adequate cause, spinning through Space
            for millions of years. Its movements may be retrograde, or they
            may be direct, about a hundred various reasons being offered for
            both motions, in about as many hypotheses; anyhow, it joins the
            maze of stars, whose origin belongs to the same miraculous and
            spontaneous order—for:</p>

          Physics Or Metaphysics?</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If there is
          anything like progress on earth, Science will some day have to give
          up, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nolens volens</span></span>, such monstrous
          ideas as her physical, self-guiding laws, void of Soul and Spirit,
          and will then have to turn to the Occult Teachings. It has already
          done so, however altered may be the title-pages and revised
          editions of the Scientific Catechism. It is now over half a century
          since, in comparing modern with ancient thought, it was found that,
          however different our Philosophy may appear from that of our
          ancestors, it is, nevertheless, composed only of additions and
          subtractions taken from the old Philosophy and transmitted drop by
          drop through the filter of antecedents.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This fact was
          well known to Faraday, and to other eminent men of Science. Atoms,
          Ether, Evolution itself—all come to Modern Science from ancient
          notions, all are based on the conceptions of the archaic nations.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Conceptions”</span> for the profane, under
          the shape of allegories; plain truths taught during the Initiations
          to the Elect, which truths have been partially divulged through
          Greek writers and have descended to us. This does not mean that
          Occultism has ever had the same views on Matter, Atoms and Ether as
          may be found in the exotericism of the classical Greek writers.
          Yet, if we may believe Mr. Tyndall, even Faraday was an
          Aristotelean, and was more an Agnostic than a Materialist. In his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Faraday,
          as a Discoverer</span></span>,<a href="#note_860" id="noteref_860" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a> the
          author shows the great Physicist using <span class="tei tei-q">“old
          reflections of Aristotle”</span> which are <span class="tei tei-q">“concisely found in some of his works.”</span> Faraday,
          Boscovitch, and all others, however, who see, in the Atoms and
          molecules, <span class="tei tei-q">“centres of force,”</span> and
          in the corresponding element, Force, an Entity by itself, are far
          nearer the truth, perchance, than those, who, denouncing them,
          denounce at the same time the <span class="tei tei-q">“old
          corpuscular Pythagorean theory”</span>—one, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page553">[pg 553]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg553"></a> by the way, which never passed to
          posterity as the great Philosopher really taught it—on the ground
          of its <span class="tei tei-q">“delusion that the conceptual
          elements of matter can be grasped as separate and real
          entities.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief and
          most fatal mistake and fallacy made by Science, in the view of the
          Occultists, lies in the idea of the possibility of such a thing
          existing in Nature as inorganic, or dead Matter. Is anything dead
          or inorganic which is capable of transformation or
          change?—Occultism asks. And is there anything under the sun which
          remains immutable or changeless?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a thing to
          be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dead</span></em> implies that it had been at
          some time <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">living</span></em>. When, at what period of
          cosmogony? Occultism says that in all cases Matter is the most
          active, when it appears inert. A wooden or a stone block is
          motionless and impenetrable to all intents and purposes.
          Nevertheless, and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span>, its particles are in
          ceaseless eternal vibration which is so rapid that to the physical
          eye the body seems absolutely devoid of motion; and the spacial
          distance between those particles in their vibratory motion
          is—considered from another plane of being and perception—as great
          as that which separates snow flakes or drops of rain. But to
          Physical Science this will be an absurdity.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This fallacy is
          nowhere better illustrated than in the scientific work of a German
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">savant</span></span>, Professor Philip
          Spiller. In this cosmological treatise, the author attempts to
          prove that:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">No material constituent of a body, no atom, is in
          itself originally endowed with force, but that every such atom is
          absolutely dead, and without any inherent power to act at a
          distance.</span><a href="#note_861" id="noteref_861" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">861</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This statement,
          however, does not prevent Spiller from enunciating an Occult
          doctrine and principle. He asserts <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the independent
          substantiality of Force</span></em>, and shows it as an
          <span class="tei tei-q">“incorporeal stuff”</span> (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">unkörperlicher
          Stoff</span></span>) or Substance. Now <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Substance</span></em> is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Matter</span></em>
          in Metaphysics, and for argument's sake it may be granted that it
          is a wrong expression to use. But this is due to the poverty of
          European languages, and especially to the paucity of scientific
          terms. Then this <span class="tei tei-q">“stuff”</span> is
          identified and connected by Spiller with the Æther. Expressed in
          Occult language it might be said with more correctness that this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Force-Substance”</span> is the ever-active
          phenomenal positive Ether—Prakriti; while the omnipresent
          all-pervading Æther is the Noumenon of the former, the substratum
          of all, or Âkâsha. Nevertheless, Stallo falls foul of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page554">[pg 554]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg554"></a> Spiller, as he does of the
          Materialists. He is accused of <span class="tei tei-q">“utter
          disregard of the fundamental correlation of Force and
          Matter,”</span> of neither of which Science knows anything certain.
          For this <span class="tei tei-q">“hypostasized half-concept”</span>
          is, in the view of all other Physicists, not only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imponderable</span></em>, but destitute of
          cohesive, chemical, thermal, electric, and magnetic forces, of all
          of which forces—according to Occultism—Æther is the Source and
          Cause.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore
          Spiller, with all his mistakes, exhibits more intuition than does
          any other modern Scientist, with the exception, perhaps, of Dr.
          Richardson, the theorist on <span class="tei tei-q">“Nerve-Force,”</span> or Nervous Ether, also on
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun-Force and Earth-Force.”</span><a href="#note_862" id="noteref_862" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a> For
          Æther, in Esotericism, is the very quintessence of all possible
          energy, and it is certainly to this Universal Agent (composed of
          many agents) that are due all the manifestations of energy in the
          material, psychic and spiritual worlds.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, in fact,
          are electricity and light? How can Science know that one is a fluid
          and the other a <span class="tei tei-q">“mode of motion”</span>?
          Why is no reason given why a difference should be made between
          them, since both are considered as force-correlations? Electricity
          is a fluid, we are told, immaterial and lion-molecular—though
          Helmholtz thinks otherwise—and the proof of it is that we can
          bottle it up, accumulate it and store it away. Then, it must be
          simply Matter, and no peculiar <span class="tei tei-q">“fluid.”</span> Nor is it only <span class="tei tei-q">“a mode of motion,”</span> for motion could hardly be
          stored in a Leyden jar. As for light, it is a still more
          extraordinary <span class="tei tei-q">“mode of motion”</span>;
          since, <span class="tei tei-q">“marvellous as it may appear, light
          [also] can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actually be stored up for
          use</span></em>,”</span> as was demonstrated by Grove nearly half a
          century ago.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is it that
          remains fixed, nailed, so to say, on the paper? It is a Force
          certainly that fixed the thing, but what is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that
          thing</span></em>, the residue of which remains on the paper?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our learned men
          will get out of this by some scientific technicality; but what is
          it that is intercepted, so as to imprison a certain quantity of it
          on glass, paper, or wood? Is it <span class="tei tei-q">“Motion”</span> or is it <span class="tei tei-q">“Force”</span>? Or shall we be told that what remains
          behind is only the effect of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page555">[pg 555]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg555"></a> Force or Motion? Then what is this Force?
          Force or Energy is a quality; but every quality must belong to a
          something, or a somebody. In Physics, Force is defined as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“that which changes or tends to change any
          physical relation between bodies, whether mechanical, thermal,
          chemical, electrical, magnetic, etc.”</span> But it is not that
          Force or that Motion which remains behind on the paper, when the
          Force or Motion has ceased to act; and yet something, which our
          physical senses cannot perceive, has been left there, to become a
          cause in its turn and to produce effects. What is it? It is not
          Matter, as defined by Science—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, Matter in any of its known
          states. An Alchemist would say it was a spiritual secretion—and he
          would be laughed at. But yet, when the Physicist said that
          electricity, stored up, is a fluid, or that light fixed on paper is
          still sunlight—that was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Science</span></em>. The newest authorities
          have, indeed, rejected these explanations as <span class="tei tei-q">“exploded theories,”</span> and have now deified
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Motion”</span> as their sole idol. But,
          surely, they and their idol will one day share the fate of their
          predecessors! An experienced Occultist, one who has verified the
          whole series of Nidânas, of causes and effects, that finally
          project their last effect on to this our plane of manifestations,
          one who has traced Matter back to its Noumenon, holds the opinion
          that the explanation of the Physicist is like calling anger, or its
          effects—the exclamation provoked by it—a secretion or a fluid, and
          man, the cause of it, its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">material</span></em> conductor. But, as Grove
          prophetically remarked, the day is fast approaching when it will be
          confessed that the Forces we know are but the phenomenal
          manifestations of Realities we know nothing about—but which were
          known to the Ancients, and by them worshipped.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He made one
          still more suggestive remark which ought to have become the motto
          of Science, but has not. Sir William Grove said that: <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Science should have neither desires nor
          prejudices. Truth should be her sole aim</span></span>.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile, in
          our days, Scientists are more self-opinionated and bigoted than
          even the Clergy. For they minister to, if they do not actually
          worship, <span class="tei tei-q">“Force-Matter,”</span> which is
          their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Unknown God</span></em>. And how unknown it
          is, may be inferred from the many confessions of the most eminent
          Physicists and Biologists, with Faraday at their head. Not only, he
          said, could he never presume to pronounce whether Force was a
          property or function of Matter, but he actually did not know what
          was meant by the word Matter.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a
          time, he added, when he believed he knew something of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page556">[pg 556]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg556"></a> Matter. But the more he lived, and the
          more carefully he studied it, the more he became convinced of his
          utter ignorance of the nature of Matter.<a href="#note_864" id="noteref_864" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This ominous
          confession was made, we believe, at a Scientific Congress at
          Swansea. Faraday held a similar opinion, however, as stated by
          Tyndall:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Occultists
          are often misunderstood because, for lack of better terms, they
          apply to the Essence of Force, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">under certain
          aspects</span></em>, the descriptive epithet of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Substance</span></em>. Now the names for the
          varieties of Substance on different planes of perception and being
          are legion. Eastern Occultism has a special appellation for each
          kind; but Science—like England, in the recollection of a witty
          Frenchman, blessed with thirty-six religions and only one
          fish-sauce—has but one name for all, namely <span class="tei tei-q">“Substance.”</span> Moreover, neither the orthodox
          Physicists nor their critics seem to be very certain of their
          premisses, and are as apt to confuse the effects as they are the
          causes. It is incorrect, for instance, to say, as Stallo does, that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter can no more be realized or
          conceived as mere positive spatial presence than as a concretion of
          forces,”</span> or that <span class="tei tei-q">“Force is nothing
          without mass, and mass is nothing without force”</span>—for one is
          the Noumenon and the other the phenomenon. Again; Schelling, when

          the respective fundamental principles. For if the assumption of
          Atoms of different specific gravities is deemed absurd, on the
          basis of the atomic theory in Physics; and if Chemistry,
          nevertheless, on this very assumption, meets with <span class="tei tei-q">“unfailing experimental verification,”</span> in the
          formation and transformation of chemical compounds; then it becomes

          only differences of density, and differences of density are
          differences of distance between the particles contained in a given
          space,”</span> is not really valid, because, before a Physicist can
          argue in his defence that <span class="tei tei-q">“as in the atom
          there is no multiplicity of particles and no void space, hence
          differences of density or weight are impossible in the case of
          atoms,”</span> he must first know what an Atom is, in reality, and
          that is just what he cannot know. He must bring it under the
          observation of at least one of his physical senses—and that he
          cannot do: for the simple reason that no one has ever seen, smelt,
          heard, touched or tasted an Atom. The Atom belongs wholly to the
          domain of Metaphysics. It is an entified abstraction—at any rate
          for Physical Science—and has nought to do with Physics, strictly
          speaking, as it can never be brought to the test of retort or
          balance. The mechanical conception, therefore, becomes a jumble of
          the most conflicting theories and dilemmas, in the minds of the
          many Scientists who disagree on this, as on other subjects; and its
          evolution is beheld with the greatest bewilderment by the Eastern
          Occultist, who follows this scientific strife.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To conclude, on
          the question of gravity. How can Science presume to know anything
          certain of it? How can it maintain its position and its hypotheses
          against those of the Occultists, who see in gravity only sympathy
          and antipathy, or attraction and repulsion, caused by physical
          polarity on our terrestrial plane, and by spiritual causes outside
          its influence? How can they disagree with the Occultists before
          they agree among themselves? Indeed one hears of the Conservation
          of Energy, and in the same breath of the perfect hardness and
          inelasticity of the Atoms; of the kinetic theory of gases being
          identical with <span class="tei tei-q">“potential energy,”</span>
          so called, and, at the same time, of the elementary units of mass
          being absolutely hard and inelastic! An Occultist opens a

          Substance, and have led them to proclaim the existence of the

          totality of existences in the Kosmos, which falls within any of the

          heat, and to urge, as a proof, the fact that Mr. Crookes'
          radiometer has unsettled no views. If they would fathom the
          ultimate nature of these Forces, they have first to admit their

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supersensuous</span></em> that nature may be.

          Mystics, such men as Paracelsus, Philalethes, Van Helmont, and so
          many others, would have to be regarded as worse than visionaries;
          they would become impostors and deliberate mystificators.</p>

          unscientific.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          justification for such an accusation. In no way—as already more
          than once stated—do the Occultists dispute the explanations of
          Science, as affording a solution of the immediate objective
          agencies at work. Science only errs in believing that, because it
          has detected in vibratory waves the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proximate</span></em> cause of these
          phenomena, it has, therefore, revealed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
          that lies beyond the threshold of Sense. It merely traces the
          sequence of phenomena on a plane of effects, illusory projections
          from the region that Occultism has long since penetrated. And the
          latter maintains that those etheric tremors are not set up, as
          asserted by Science, by the vibrations of the molecules of known
          bodies, the Matter of our terrestrial objective consciousness, but
          that we must seek for the ultimate Causes of light, heat, etc., in
          Matter existing in supersensuous states—states, however, as fully
          objective to the spiritual eye of man, as a horse or a tree is to
          the ordinary mortal. Light and heat are the ghost or shadow of
          Matter in motion. Such states can be perceived by the Seer or the
          Adept during the hours of trance, under the Sushumnâ Ray—the first
          of the Seven Mystic Rays of the Sun.<a href="#note_879" id="noteref_879" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">879</span></span></a></p>

          cannot be inferred from its remoter manifestations, its merely

          production of heat by friction—excitation of molecular motion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2) The
          conversion of heat into mechanical motion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The answer given
          is: There are fluids of various kinds. Electricity is called a
          fluid, and so was heat quite recently, but it was on the
          supposition that heat was some imponderable substance. This was
          during the supreme and autocratic reign of Matter. When Matter was
          dethroned, and Motion was proclaimed the sole sovereign ruler of
          the Universe, heat became a <span class="tei tei-q">“mode of
          motion.”</span> We need not despair; it may become something else
          to-morrow. Like the Universe itself, Science is ever becoming, and
          can never say, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am that I am.”</span> On
          the other hand, Occult Science has its changeless traditions from
          prehistoric times. It may err in particulars; it can never become
          guilty of a mistake in questions of Universal Law, simply because
          that Science, justly referred to by Philosophy as the Divine, was
          born on higher planes, and was brought to Earth by Beings who were
          wiser than man will be, even in the Seventh Race of his Seventh
          Round. And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> Science maintains that Forces
          are not what modern learning would have them; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>,
          magnetism is not a <span class="tei tei-q">“mode of motion”</span>;
          and, in this particular case, at least, exact Modern Science is
          sure to come to grief some day. Nothing, at the first blush, can
          appear more ridiculous, more outrageously absurd than to say, for
          instance: The Hindû initiated Yogî knows really ten times more than
          the greatest European Physicist of the ultimate nature and
          constitution of light, both solar and lunar. Yet why is the
          Sushumnâ Ray believed to be that Ray which furnishes the Moon with
          its borrowed light? Why is it <span class="tei tei-q">“the Ray
          cherished by the initiated Yogî”</span>? Why is the Moon considered
          as the Deity of the Mind, by those Yogîs? We say, because light, or
          rather all its Occult properties, every combination and correlation
          of it with other forces, mental, psychic, and spiritual, was
          perfectly known to the old Adepts.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore,
          although Occult Science may be less well-informed than modern
          Chemistry as to the behaviour of compound elements in various cases
          of physical correlation, yet it is immeasurably higher <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page563">[pg 563]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg563"></a> in its knowledge of the ultimate Occult
          states of Matter, and of the true nature of Matter, than all the
          Physicists and Chemists of our modern day put together.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, if we state
          the truth openly and in full sincerity, namely, that the ancient
          Initiates had a far wider knowledge of Physics, as a Science of
          Nature, than is possessed by our Academies of Science, all taken
          together, the statement will be characterized as an impertinence
          and an absurdity; for Physical Sciences are considered to have been
          carried in our age to the apex of perfection. Hence, the twitting
          query: Can the Occultists meet successfully the two points, namely
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the production of heat by
          friction—excitation of molecular motion; and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) the
          conversion of heat into mechanical force, if they hold to the old
          exploded theory of heat being a substance or a fluid?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To answer the
          question, it must first be observed that the Occult Sciences do not
          regard either electricity, or any of the Forces supposed to be
          generated by it, as Matter in any of the states known to Physical
          Science; to put it more clearly, none of these Forces, so-called,
          is a solid, gas, or fluid. If it did not look pedantic, an
          Occultist would even object to electricity being called a fluid—as
          it is an effect and not a cause. But its Noumenon, he would say, is
          a Conscious Cause. The same in the cases of <span class="tei tei-q">“Force”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Atom.”</span> Let us see what an eminent Academician,
          Butlerof, the Chemist, had to say about these two abstractions.
          This great man of Science argues:</p>

          scientific stand-point, and as warranted by the law of conservation
          of energy? Conceptions of Force are resumed by our conceptions of
          this, that, or another mode of motion. Force is thus simply the
          passage of one state of motion into another state of the same; of
          electricity into heat and light, of heat into sound or some
          mechanical function, and so on.</span><a href="#note_882" id="noteref_882" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">882</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">The first time electric fluid was
          produced by man on earth it must have been by friction; hence, as
          well known, it is heat that produces it by disturbing its zero
          state,</span><a href="#note_883" id="noteref_883" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">and

<span style="font-size: 90%">than heat or light, or any other
            force. They are all correlations, as Science says. When a given
            quantity of heat, assisted by a steam engine, is transformed into
            mechanical work, we speak of steam power (or force). When a
            falling body strikes an obstacle in its way, thereby generating
            heat and sound—we call it the power of collision. When
            electricity decomposes water or heats a platinum wire, we speak
            of the force of the electric fluid. When the rays of the sun are
            intercepted by the thermometer bulb and its quicksilver expands,
            we speak of the calorific energy of the sun. In short, when one
            state of</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page564">[pg
            564]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg564"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">a determined
            quantity of motion ceases, another state of motion equivalent to
            the preceding takes its place, and the result of such a
            transformation or correlation is—Force. In all cases where such a
            transformation, or the passage of one state of motion into
            another, is entirely absent, there no force is possible. Let us
            admit for a moment an absolutely homogeneous state of the
            Universe, and our conception of Force falls down to
            nought.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Therefore it becomes evident that the Force,
            which Materialism considers as the cause of the diversity that
            surrounds us, is in sober reality only an effect, a result of
            that diversity. From such point of view Force is not the cause of
            motion, but a result, while the cause of that Force, or forces,
            is not the Substance or Matter, but Motion itself. Matter thus
            must be laid aside, and with it the basic principle of
            Materialism, which has become unnecessary, as Force brought down
            to a state of motion can give no idea of the Substance. If Force
            is the result of motion, then it becomes incomprehensible why
            that motion should become witness to Matter and not to Spirit or
            a Spiritual essence. True, our reason cannot conceive of a motion
            minus something moving (and our reason is right); but the nature
            or</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">esse</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">of that something moving remains to
            Science entirely unknown; and the Spiritualist, in such case, has
            as much right to attribute it to a</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Spirit,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">as
            a Materialist to creative and all-potential Matter. A Materialist
            has no special privileges in this instance, nor can he claim any.
            The law of the conservation of energy, as thus seen, is shown to
            be illegitimate in its pretensions and claims in this case.

            solemn significance with which Materialism has tried to invest
            it. The conception of Force still gives no idea of Matter, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We are assured
          that Modern Science is not Materialistic; and our own conviction
          tells us that it cannot be so, when its learning is real. There is
          good reason for this, well defined by some Physicists and Chemists
          themselves. Natural Sciences cannot go hand in hand with
          Materialism. To be at the height of their calling, men of Science
          have to reject the very possibility of Materialistic doctrines
          having aught to do with the Atomic Theory; and we find that Lange,
          Butlerof, Du Bois Reymond—the last probably unconsciously—and
          several others, have proved it. And this is, furthermore,
          demonstrated by the fact, that Kanâda in India, and Leucippus and
          Democritus in Greece, and after them Epicurus—the earliest Atomists
          in Europe—while propagating their doctrine of definite proportions,
          believed in Gods or supersensuous Entities, at the same time. Their
          ideas upon Matter thus differed from those now prevalent. We must
          be allowed to make our statement clearer by a short synopsis of the
          ancient and modern <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page565">[pg
          565]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg565"></a>
          views of Philosophy upon Atoms, and thus prove that the Atomic
          Theory kills Materialism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
          standpoint of Materialism, which reduces the beginnings of all to
          Matter, the Universe consists, in its fulness, of Atoms and
          vacuity. Even leaving aside the axiom taught by the Ancients, and
          now absolutely demonstrated by telescope and microscope, that
          Nature abhors a vacuum, what is an Atom? Professor Butlerof
          writes:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It is, we are answered by Science, the limited
          division of Substance, the indivisible particle of Matter. To admit
          the divisibility of the atom, amounts to an admission of an
          infinite divisibility of Substance, which is equivalent to reducing
          Substance to</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">nihil</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
            or nothingness. Owing to a feeling of self-preservation alone,
            Materialism cannot admit infinite divisibility; otherwise, it
            would have to bid farewell for ever to its basic principle and
            thus sign its own death-warrant.</span><a href="#note_885" id="noteref_885" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">885</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Büchner, for

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Atom is
          indivisible then, saith Materialism? Very well. Butlerof
          answers:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">See now what a curious contradiction this
          fundamental principle of the Materialists is leading them into. The
          atom is</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">indivisible</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">,
            and at the same time we know it to be</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">elastic</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">.
            An attempt to deprive it of elasticity is unthinkable; it would
            amount to an absurdity. Absolutely non-elastic atoms could never
            exhibit a single one of those numerous phenomena that are
            attributed to their correlations. Without any elasticity, the
            atoms could not manifest their energy, and the Substance of the
            Materialists would remain weeded of every force. Therefore, if
            the Universe is composed of atoms, then those atoms must be
            elastic. It is here that we meet with an insuperable obstacle.
            For, what are the conditions requisite for the manifestation of
            elasticity? An elastic ball, when striking against an obstacle,
            is flattened and contracts, which it would be impossible for it
            to do, were not that ball to consist of particles, the relative
            position of which experiences at the time of the blow a temporary
            change. This may be said of elasticity in general; no elasticity
            is possible without change with respect to the position of the
            compound particles of an elastic body. This means that the
            elastic body is changeful and consists of particles, or, in other
            words, that elasticity can pertain only to those bodies that are
            divisible. And the atom</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">is</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">elastic.</span><a href="#note_886" id="noteref_886" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">886</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
          sufficient to show how absurd are the simultaneous admissions of
          the non-divisibility and of the elasticity of the Atom. The Atom is
          elastic, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ergo</span></span>, the Atom is divisible, and
          must consist of particles, or of sub-atoms. And these sub-atoms?
          They are either non-elastic, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page566">[pg 566]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg566"></a> and in such case they represent no dynamic
          importance, or, they are elastic also; and in that case, they, too,
          are subject to divisibility. And thus <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ad
          infinitum</span></span>. But infinite divisibility of Atoms
          resolves Matter into simple centres of Force, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          precludes the possibility of conceiving Matter as an objective
          substance.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This vicious
          circle is fatal to Materialism. It finds itself caught in its own
          nets, and no issue out of the dilemma is possible for it. If it
          says that the Atom is indivisible, then it will have Mechanics
          asking it the awkward question:</p>

          those Powers. It is on the doctrine of the illusive nature of
          Matter, and the infinite divisibility of the Atom, that the whole
          Science of Occultism is built. It opens limitless horizons to
          Substance, informed by the divine breath of its Soul in every
          possible state of tenuity, states still undreamed of by the most
          spiritually disposed Chemists and Physicists.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above views
          were enunciated by an Academician, the greatest Chemist in Russia,
          and a recognized authority even in Europe, the late Professor
          Butlerof. True, he was defending the phenomena of the
          Spiritualists, the materializations, so-called, in which he
          believed, as Professors Zöllner and Hare did, as Mr. A. Russel
          Wallace, Mr. W. Crookes, and many another Fellow of the Royal
          Society, do still, whether openly or secretly. But his argument
          with regard to the nature of the Essence that acts behind the
          physical phenomena of light, heat, electricity, etc., is no less
          scientific and authoritative for all that, and applies admirably to
          the case in hand. Science has no right to deny to the Occultists
          their claim to a more profound knowledge of the so-called Forces,
          which, they say, are only the effects of causes generated by
          Powers, substantial, yet supersensuous, and beyond any kind of
          Matter with which Scientists have hitherto become acquainted. The
          most Science can do is to assume and to maintain the attitude of
          Agnosticism. Then it can say: Your case is no more proven than is
          ours; but we confess to knowing nothing in reality either about
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page567">[pg 567]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg567"></a> Force or Matter, or
          about that which lies at the bottom of the so-called correlation of
          Forces. Therefore, time alone can prove who is right and who is
          wrong. Let us wait patiently, and meanwhile show mutual courtesy,
          instead of scoffing at each other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to do this
          requires a boundless love of truth and the surrender of that
          prestige—however false—of infallibility, which the men of Science
          have acquired among the ignorant and flippant, though cultured,
          masses of the profane. The blending of the two Sciences, the
          Archaic and the Modern, requires first of all the abandonment of
          the actual Materialistic lines. It necessitates a kind of religious
          Mysticism and even the study of old Magic, which our Academicians
          will never take up. The necessity is easily explained. Just as in
          old Alchemical works the real meaning of the Substances and
          Elements mentioned is concealed under the most ridiculous
          metaphors, so are the physical, psychic, and spiritual natures of
          the Elements (say of Fire) concealed in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>;,
          and especially in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, under allegories
          comprehensible only to the Initiates. Had they no meaning, then
          indeed all these long legends and allegories about the sacredness
          of the three types of Fire, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Forty-Nine original
          Fires</span></span>—personified by the Sons of Daksha's Daughters
          and the Rishis, their Husbands, <span class="tei tei-q">“who with
          the first Son of Brahmâ and his three descendants constitute the
          Forty-nine Fires”</span>—would be idiotic verbiage and no more. But
          it is not so. Every Fire has a distinct function and meaning in the
          worlds of the physical and the spiritual. It has, moreover, in its
          essential nature a corresponding relation to one of the human
          psychic faculties, besides its well determined chemical and
          physical potencies when coming in contact with terrestrially
          differentiated Matter. Science has no speculations to offer upon
          Fire <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per se</span></span>; Occultism and ancient
          religious Science have. This is shown even in the meagre and
          purposely veiled phraseology of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, where, as in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vâyu
          Purâna</span></span>, many of the qualities of the personified
          Fires are explained. Thus, Pâvaka is Electric Fire, or Vaidyuta;
          Pavamâna, the Fire produced by Friction, or Nirmathya: and Shuchi
          is Solar Fire, or Saura<a href="#note_888" id="noteref_888" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a>—all
          these three being the sons of Abhimânin, the Agni (Fire), eldest
          son of Brahmâ and of Svâhâ. Pâvaka, moreover, is made parent to
          Kavyavâhana, the Fire of the Pitris: Shuchi to Havyaváhana, the
          Fire of the Gods; and Pavamâna to Saharaksha, the Fire of the
          Asuras. Now all this shows that the writers of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>
          were perfectly conversant <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page568">[pg
          568]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg568"></a>
          with the Forces of Science and their correlations, as well as with
          the various qualities of the latter in their bearing upon those
          psychic and physical phenomena which receive no credit and are now
          unknown to Physical Science. Very naturally, when an Orientalist,
          especially one with materialistic tendencies, reads that these are
          only appellations of Fire employed in the invocations and rituals,
          he calls this <span class="tei tei-q">“Tântrika superstition and
          mystification”</span>; and he becomes more careful to avoid errors
          in spelling than to give attention to the secret meaning attached
          to the personifications, or to seek their explanation in the
          physical correlations of Forces, so far as these are known. So
          little credit, indeed, is given to the ancient Âryans for
          knowledge, that even such glaring passages as that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This means, of
          course, that the writers were perfectly acquainted with
          correlation, and were well posted about the origin of Kosmos from
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Indiscrete Principle,”</span>
          Avyaktânugrahena, as applied to Parabrahman and Mûlaprakriti

          Initiates knew of no <span class="tei tei-q">“miraculous
          creation,”</span> but taught the evolution of Atoms, on our
          physical plane, and their first differentiation from Laya into
          Protyle, as Mr. Crookes has suggestively named Matter, or
          primordial substance, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beyond</span></em> the zero-line—there where

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This can be
          easily demonstrated. Take, for instance, the newly-published
          catechism of the Vishishthâdvaita Vedântins, an orthodox and
          exoteric system, yet fully enunciated and taught in the XIth
          century<a href="#note_890" id="noteref_890" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">890</span></span></a> at a

          believed in the squareness and flatness of the Earth of Cosmas
          Indicopleustes of the VIth century. It teaches that before
          Evolution began, Prakriti, Nature, was in a condition of Laya, or
          of absolute homogeneity, as <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter exists
          in two conditions, the Sûkshma, or latent and undifferentiated, and
          the Sthûla, or differentiated, condition.”</span> Then it became
          Anu, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page569">[pg 569]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg569"></a> atomic. It teaches
          of Suddasattva—<span class="tei tei-q">“a substance not subject to
          the qualities of Matter, from which it is quite different,”</span>
          and adds that out of that Substance the bodies of the Gods, the
          inhabitants of Vaikunthaloka, the Heaven of Vishnu, are formed.
          That every particle or atom of Prakriti contains Jîva (divine
          life), and is the Sharîra (body) of that Jîva which it contains,
          while every Jîva is in its turn the Sharîra of the Supreme Spirit,
          as <span class="tei tei-q">“Parabrahman pervades every Jîva, as
          well as every particle of Matter.”</span> Dualistic and
          anthropomorphic as may be the philosophy of the Vishishthâdvaita,
          when compared with that of the Advaita—the non-dualists—it is yet
          supremely higher in logic and philosophy than the Cosmogony
          accepted either by Christianity or by its great opponent, Modern
          Science. The followers of one of the greatest minds that ever
          appeared on Earth, the Advaita Vedântins are called Atheists,
          because they regard all save Parabrahman, the Secondless, or the
          Absolute Reality as an illusion. Yet the wisest Initiates came from
          their ranks, as also the greatest Yogîs. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upanishads</span></span> show that they most
          assuredly knew not only what is the causal substance in the effects
          of friction, and that their forefathers were acquainted with the
          conversion of heat into mechanical force, but that they were also
          acquainted with the Noumenon of every spiritual as well as of every
          cosmic phenomenon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Truly the young

          and a contempt for his national Gods proportioned to the honours
          received in his education in Physical Science; truly he has but to
          read in the light of the latter, and with an eye to the correlation

          furnished the former with a vessel full <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page570">[pg 570]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg570"></a> of heavenly fire. The primeval mode of
          obtaining fire by friction has its scientific explanation in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vedas</span></span>, and is pregnant with
          meaning for him who reads between the lines. The Tretâgni (sacred
          triad of fires) obtained by the attrition of sticks made of the
          wood of the Ashvattha tree, the Bo-tree of Wisdom and Knowledge,
          sticks <span class="tei tei-q">“as many finger-breadths long as
          there are syllables in the Gâyatrî,”</span> must have a secret

          and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> were no sacred writers
          but mystificators. That it has such a meaning, the Hindu Occultists
          are a proof, and they alone are able to enlighten Science, as to
          why and how the Fire, that was primevally One, was made three-fold
          (tretâ) in our present Manvantara, by the Son of Ilâ (Vâch), the
          Primeval Woman after the Deluge, the wife and daughter of
          Vaivasvata Manu. The allegory is suggestive, in whatever

          precise views of the immortal heretic, whose name I have whispered

          with the argument on which nearly all physicists are agreed, that
          there exist in nature two agencies—matter which is ponderable,
          visible, and tangible, and a something which is imponderable,
          invisible, and appreciable only by its influence on matter—Metcalfe

            contended for by him on the following grounds:</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">(i) That it may be added to, and abstracted from
            other bodies and measured with mathematical

            and conditions of all other bodies.</span></p>

            passes by radiation through the most perfect
            vacuum</span></span><a href="#note_894" id="noteref_894" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">that can be formed, in which it
            produces the same effects on the thermometer as in the

            forces which nothing can restrain, as in volcanoes, the explosion
            of gunpowder, and other fulminating compounds.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">(vi) That it operates in a sensible manner on
            the nervous system, producing intense pain; and when in excess,
            disorganization of the tissues.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">As against the vibratory theory, Metcalfe
            further argues that if caloric were a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">mere property or
            quality</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, it could not
            augment the volume of other bodies; for this purpose it must
            itself have volume, it must occupy space, and it must, therefore,
            be a material agent. If caloric were</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">only the effect of vibratory
            motion</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">amongst the
            particles of ponderable matter,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">it could not radiate from
            hot bodies</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">without the
            simultaneous transition of the vibrating particles; but the fact
            stands out that heat can radiate from material ponderable
            substance without loss of weight of such substance.... With this
            view as to the material nature of caloric or sun-force; with the
            impression firmly fixed on his mind that</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">everything in Nature is composed of two
            descriptions of matter, the one essentially active and ethereal,
            the other passive and motionless,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><a href="#note_895" id="noteref_895" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">895</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Metcalfe based the hypothesis that
            the sun-force, or caloric, is a self-active principle. For its
            own particles, he holds, it has repulsion; for the particles of
            all ponderable matter it has affinity; it attracts the particles
            of ponderable matter with forces which vary inversely as the
            squares of the distance. It thus acts</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">through</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">ponderable matter. If universal
            space were filled with caloric, sun-force, alone (without
            ponderable matter), caloric would also be inactive and would
            constitute a boundless ocean of powerless or quiescent ether,
            because it would then have nothing on which to act, while
            ponderable matter, however inactive of itself, has</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">certain
            properties by which it modifies and controls the actions of
            caloric, both of which are governed by immutable laws that have
            their origin in the mutual relations and specific properties of
            each.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">And he lays down a law which he believes is
            absolute, and which is thus expressed:</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">By the attraction of caloric for ponderable
            matter, it unites and holds together all things; by its
            self-repulsive energy it separates and expands all
            things.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

            upon this depends the various changing conditions of matter; the
            solid, the liquid, the gaseous condition. Solid bodies have

            the liquid form by the abstraction of caloric, and again
            converted into a firm solid, the particles of which would cling
            together with a force proportional to their augmented affinity
            for caloric. On the other hand, by adding a sufficient quantity
            of the same principle to the densest metals, their attraction for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Arago proposed that this envelope should be called
          the Photosphere, a name now generally adopted. By the elder
          Herschell, the surface of this photosphere was compared to
          mother-of-pearl.... It resembles the ocean on a tranquil
          summer-day, when its surface is slightly crisped by a gentle
          breeze.... Mr. Nasmyth has discovered a more remarkable condition
          than any that had previously been suspected, ... objects which are
          peculiarly lens-shaped ... like</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">willow leaves,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">...
          different in size ... not arranged in any order, ... crossing each
          other in all directions ... with an irregular motion among
          themselves.... They are seen approaching to and receding from each
          other, and sometimes assuming new angular positions, so that the
          appearance ... has been compared to a dense shoal of fish, which,
          indeed, they resemble in shape.... The size of these objects gives
          a grand idea of the gigantic scale upon which physical (?)
          operations are carried out in the sun. They cannot be less than
          1,000 miles in length, and from two to three hundred miles in
          breadth. The most probable conjecture which has been offered
          respecting those leaf or lens-like objects, is that the
          photosphere</span><a href="#note_912" id="noteref_912" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">912</span></span></a>

          the living man; a medium, which, being present, enables the

          absent, leaves the body actually dead.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the whole
          Solar System falls into Pralaya—the author might have added. But
          let us read further:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">I use the word ether in its general sense as
          meaning a very light, vaporous or gaseous matter; I use it, in
          short, as the astronomer uses it when he speaks of the ether of
          Space, by which he means a subtle but material medium.... When I
          speak of a</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">nervous</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">ether, I do not convey that the ether
          is existent in nervous structure only: I believe truly that it is a
          special part of the nervous organization; but, as nerves pass into
          all structures that have capacities for movement and sensibilities,
          so the nervous ether passes into all such parts; and as the nervous
          ether is, according to my view, a direct product from blood, so we
          may look upon it as a part of the atmosphere of the blood.... The
          evidence in favour of the existence of an elastic medium pervading
          the nervous matter and capable of being influenced by simple
          pressure is all-convincing.... In nervous structure there is,
          unquestionably, a true nervous fluid, as our predecessors

<span style="font-size: 90%">composition of this fluid is not yet

            and passes from them to the nerves, or whether it is formed
            everywhere where blood enters nerve, we do not know. The exact
            uses of the fluid we do not consequently know. It occurs to my

            of itself sufficient to act as the subtle medium that connects
            the outer with the inner universe of man and animal. I think—and
            this is the modification I suggest to the older theory—there must
            be another form of matter present during life; a matter which
            exists in the condition of vapour or gas, which pervades the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not so.
          The opinion that Pantheism <span class="tei tei-q">“fails to be
          true because it would destroy the individuality of every individual
          sense”</span> shows that all the conclusions of the learned doctor
          are based on the modern physical theories, though he would fain
          reform them. But he will find it impossible to do this unless he
          allows the existence of spiritual senses to replace the gradual
          atrophy of the physical. <span class="tei tei-q">“We see and
          hear,”</span> in accordance (of course, in Dr. Richardson's mind)
          with the explanations of the phenomena of sight and hearing,
          afforded by that same Materialistic Science which postulates that
          we cannot see and hear otherwise. The Occultists and Mystics know
          better. The Vedic Âryans were as familiar with the mysteries of
          sound and colour on the physical plane as are our Physiologists,
          but they had also mastered the secrets of both on planes
          inaccessible to the Materialist. They knew of a double set of
          senses; spiritual and material. In a man who is deprived of one or
          more senses, the remaining senses become the more developed; for
          instance, the blind man will recover his sight through the senses
          of touch, of hearing, etc., and he who is deaf will be able to hear
          through sight, by seeing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">audibly</span></em> the words uttered by the
          lips and mouth of the speaker. But these are cases that belong to
          the world of Matter still. The spiritual senses, those that act on
          a higher plane of consciousness, are rejected <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à
          priori</span></span> by Physiology, because the latter is ignorant
          of the Sacred Science. It limits the action of Ether to vibrations,
          and, dividing it from air—though air is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page583">[pg 583]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg583"></a> simply differentiated and compound
          Ether—makes it assume functions to fit in with the special theories

          Ascetics. Hence the one-sided remarks of even the most liberal
          among them, based on and flowing from undue importance given to the
          arbitrary divisions and classification of Physical Science.
          Occultism heeds them very little, and Nature heeds them still less.
          The whole range of physical phenomena proceeds from the Primary of
          Æther—Âkâsha, as dual-natured Âkâsha proceeds from undifferentiated
          Chaos, so-called, the latter being the primary aspect of
          Mûlaprakriti, the Root-Matter and the first abstract Idea one can
          form of Parabrahman. Modern Science may divide its hypothetically
          conceived Ether in as many ways as it likes; the real Æther of
          Space will remain as it is throughout. It has its seven
          <span class="tei tei-q">“principles,”</span> as all the rest of
          Nature has, and where there was no Æther there would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">“sound,”</span> as it is the vibrating
          sounding-board in Nature in all its seven differentiations. This is
          the first mystery the Initiates of old have learned. Our present
          normal physical senses were, from our present point of view,
          abnormal in those days of slow and progressive downward evolution
          and fall into Matter. And there was a day when all that in our
          modern times is regarded as exceptional, so puzzling to the
          Physiologists now compelled to believe in them—such as
          thought-transference, clairvoyance, clairaudience, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page586">[pg 586]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg586"></a> etc.; in short, all that is now called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“wonderful and abnormal”</span>—when all
          that and much more belonged to the senses and faculties common to
          all humanity. We are, however, cycling back and cycling forward;
          that is to say, that having lost in spirituality what we acquired
          in physical development until almost the end of the Fourth Race, we
          are now as gradually and imperceptibly losing in the physical all
          that we regain once more in the spiritual reëvolution. This process
          must go on, until the period which will bring the Sixth Root-Race
          on a line parallel with the spirituality of the Second Race, a long
          extinct mankind.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this will
          hardly be understood at present. We must return to Dr. Richardson's
          hopeful, though somewhat incorrect hypothesis about <span class="tei tei-q">“Nervous Ether.”</span> Under the misleading
          translation of the word as <span class="tei tei-q">“Space,”</span>
          Âkâsha has just been shown in the ancient Hindû system as the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“first born”</span> of the One, having but
          one quality, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sound,”</span> which is
          septenary. In Esoteric language this One is the Father-Deity, and
          Sound is synonymous with the Logos, Verbum, or Son. Whether
          consciously or otherwise, it must be the latter; and Dr.
          Richardson, while preaching an Occult doctrine, chooses the lowest
          form of the septenary nature of that Sound, and speculates upon it,
          adding:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The theory, I offer, is that the nervous ether is
          an</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">animal
          product</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. In different
          classes of animals it may differ in physical quality so as to be
          adapted to the special wants of the animal, but essentially it
          plays one part in all animals, and is produced, in all, in the same
          way.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Herein lies the
          nucleus of error leading to all the resultant mistaken views. This
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Nervous Ether”</span> is the lowest
          principle of the Primordial Essence which is Life. It is Animal
          Vitality diffused in all Nature, and acting according to the
          conditions it finds for its activity. It is not an <span class="tei tei-q">“animal product,”</span> but the living animal, the
          living flower and plant, are its products. The animal tissues only
          absorb it according to their more or less morbid or healthy
          state—as do physical materials and structures (in their primogenial
          state, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nota bene</span></span>)—and, from the moment
          of the birth of the Entity, are regulated, strengthened, and fed by
          it. It descends in a larger supply to vegetation in the Sushumnâ
          Sun-Ray which lights and feeds the Moon, and it is through her
          beams that it pours its light upon, and penetrates man and animal,
          more during their sleep and rest, than when they are in full
          activity. Therefore Dr. Richardson errs again in stating that:</p>

          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">prima materia</span></span> of our Solar
          System, for they are one.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As says the
          Commentary:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Sun is the heart
          of the Solar World [System] and its brain is hidden behind the

          nerve-centre of the great body, and the waves of the life-essence
          flow into each artery and vein.... The planets are its limbs and
          pulses.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
          stated elsewhere<a href="#note_938" id="noteref_938" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">938</span></span></a> that
          Occult philosophy denies that the Sun is a globe in combustion, but
          defines it simply as a world, a glowing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page591">[pg 591]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg591"></a> sphere, the real Sun being hidden behind, and
          the visible Sun being only its reflection, its shell. The Nasmyth
          willow leaves, mistaken by Sir John Herschell for <span class="tei tei-q">“solar inhabitants,”</span> are the reservoirs of solar
          vital energy; <span class="tei tei-q">“the vital electricity that
          feeds the whole system; the sun <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          abscondito</span></span> being thus the storehouse of our little
          Cosmos, self-generating its vital fluid, and ever receiving as much
          as it gives out,”</span> and the visible Sun only a window cut into
          the real solar palace and presence, which, however, shews without
          distortion the interior work.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, during the
          manvantaric solar period, or life, there is a regular circulation
          of the vital fluid throughout our System, of which the Sun is the
          heart—like the circulation of the blood in the human body; the Sun
          contracting as rhythmically as the human heart does at every return
          of it. Only, instead of performing the round in a second or so, it
          takes the solar blood ten of its years to circulate, and a whole
          year to pass through its auricle and ventricle before it washes the
          lungs, and passes thence back to the great arteries and veins of
          the System.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, Science
          will not deny, since Astronomy knows of the fixed cycle of eleven
          years when the number of solar spots increases,<a href="#note_939" id="noteref_939" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a> the
          increase being due to the contraction of the Solar Heart. The
          Universe, our World in this case, breathes, just as man and every
          living creature, plant, and even mineral does upon the Earth; and
          as our Globe itself breathes every twenty-four hours. The dark
          region is not due to the <span class="tei tei-q">“absorption
          exerted by the vapours issuing from the bosom of the sun, and
          interposed between the observer and the photosphere,”</span> as
          Father Secchi would have it,<a href="#note_940" id="noteref_940" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> nor
          are the spots formed <span class="tei tei-q">“by the matter [heated
          gaseous matter] itself which the irruption projects upon the solar
          disk.”</span> The phenomenon is similar to the regular and healthy
          pulsation of the heart, as the life fluid passes through its hollow
          muscles. Could the human heart be made luminous, and the living and
          throbbing organ made visible, so as to have it reflected upon a
          screen, such as is used by lecturers on Astronomy to show the moon,
          for instance, then every one would see the sun-spot phenomena
          repeated every <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page592">[pg
          592]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg592"></a>
          second, and that they were due to contraction and the rushing of
          the blood.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We read in a
          work on Geology that it is the dream of Science that:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Occult
          Philosophy has taught this since the existence of human speech and
          language, adding, however, on the principle of the immutable law of
          analogy, <span class="tei tei-q">“as it is above, so it is
          below,”</span> another of its axioms, that there is neither Spirit
          nor Matter, in reality, but only numberless aspects of the One
          ever-hidden Is, or Sat. The homogeneous primordial Element is
          simple and single, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only on the terrestrial plane</span></em> of
          consciousness and sensation, since Matter, after all, is nothing
          more than the sequence of our own states of consciousness, and
          Spirit an idea of psychic intuition. Even on the next higher plane,
          that single element which is defined on our Earth by current
          Science, as the ultimate undecomposable constituent of some kind of
          Matter, would be pronounced in the world of a higher spiritual
          perception to be something very complex indeed. Our purest water
          would be found to yield, instead of its two declared simple
          elements of oxygen and hydrogen, many other constituents, undreamed
          of by our modern terrestrial Chemistry. As in the realm of Matter,
          so in the realm of Spirit, the shadow of that which is cognized on
          the plane of objectivity exists on that of pure subjectivity. The
          speck of the perfectly homogeneous Substance, the sarcode of the
          Hæckelian Moneron, is now viewed as the archebiosis of terrestrial
          existence (Mr. Huxley's protoplasm)<a href="#note_942" id="noteref_942" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a>; and
          Bathybius Hæckelii has to be traced to its pre-terrestrial
          archebiosis. This is first perceived by the Astronomers at its
          third stage of evolution, and in the <span class="tei tei-q">“secondary creation,”</span> so-called. But the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Surely, then,
          the elements now known to us—be their number whatever it may—as
          they are understood and defined at present, are not, nor can they
          be, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primordial</span></em> Elements. Those were

          Science, those Elements had their genesis in the depths of the
          primordial Fire-mist, the masses of incandescent vapour of the
          irresolvable nebulæ; for, as Professor Newcomb shows,<a href="#note_944" id="noteref_944" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a>
          resolvable nebulæ do not constitute a class of proper nebulæ. More
          than half of those, he thinks, which were at first mistaken for
          nebulæ, are what he calls <span class="tei tei-q">“starry
          clusters.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The elements now
          known have arrived at their state of permanency in this Fourth
          Round and Fifth Race. They have a short period of rest before they
          are propelled once more on their upward spiritual evolution, when
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“living fire of Orcus”</span> will
          dissociate the most irresolvable, and scatter them again into the
          primordial One.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
          Occultist goes further, as has been shown in the Commentaries on
          the Seven Stanzas. Hence he can hardly hope for any help or
          recognition from Science, which will reject both his <span class="tei tei-q">“anîyâmsam anîyasâm,”</span> the absolutely spiritual
          Atom, and his Mânasaputras or Mind-born Men. In resolving the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“single material element”</span> into one
          absolute irresolvable Element, Spirit, or Root-Matter, thus placing
          it at once outside the reach and province of Physical Philosophy—he
          has, of course but little in common with the orthodox men of
          Science. He maintains that Spirit and Matter are two Facets of the
          unknowable Unity, their apparently contrasted aspects depending,
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) on the various degrees of
          differentiation of Matter, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) on
          the grades of consciousness attained by man himself. This is,
          however, Metaphysics, and has little to do with Physics—however

          has to go further. Unless it also admits the possibility of One
          Element, or the One Life of the Occultists, it will have to hang up
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“single Substance,”</span> especially
          if limited to only the solar nebulæ, in mid air, like the coffin of
          Mahomet, though minus the attractive magnet that sustained that
          coffin. Fortunately for the speculative Physicists, if we are
          unable to state with any degree of precision what the nebular
          theory does imply, we have, thanks to Professor Winchell, and
          several dissident Astronomers, been able to learn what it does not
          imply.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately,
          this is far from clearing even the most simple of the problems that
          have vexed, and do still vex, the men of learning in their search
          after truth. We have to proceed with our enquiries, starting with
          the earliest hypotheses of Modern Science, if we would discover
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it
          sins. Perchance it may be found that Stallo is right, after all,
          and that the blunders, contradictions and fallacies made by the
          most eminent men of learning are simply due to their abnormal
          attitude. They are, and want to remain Materialistic <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">quand
          même</span></span>, and yet <span class="tei tei-q">“the general
          principles of the atomo-mechanical theory—the basis of modern
          Physics—are substantially identical with the cardinal doctrines of
          ontological Metaphysics.”</span> Thus, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          fundamental errors of ontology become apparent in proportion to the
          advance of physical science.”</span><a href="#note_946" id="noteref_946" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">946</span></span></a>
          Science is honeycombed with metaphysical conceptions, but the
          Scientists will not admit the charge, and fight desperately to put
          atomo-mechanical masks on purely incorporeal and spiritual laws in
          Nature, on our plane—refusing to admit their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page595">[pg 595]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg595"></a> substantiality even on other planes,
          the bare existence of which they reject <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à
          priori</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is easy to
          show, however, how Scientists, wedded to their materialistic views,
          have, ever since the days of Newton, endeavoured to put false masks
          on fact and truth. But their task is becoming every year more
          difficult; and every year also, Chemistry, beyond all the other
          sciences, approaches nearer and nearer the realm of the Occult in
          Nature. It is assimilating the very truths taught by the Occult
          Sciences for ages, but hitherto bitterly derided. <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter is eternal,”</span> says the Esoteric Doctrine.
          But the Matter the Occultists conceive of in its <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">laya</span></span>, or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">zero</span></em>
          state, is not the matter of Modern Science, not even in its most
          rarefied gaseous state. Mr. Crookes' <span class="tei tei-q">“radiant matter”</span> would appear Matter of the
          grossest kind in the realm of the beginnings, as it becomes pure
          Spirit before it returns back even to its first point of
          differentiation. Therefore, when the Adept or Alchemist adds that,
          though Matter is eternal, for it is Pradhâna, yet Atoms are born at
          every new Manvantara, or reconstruction of the universe, it is no
          such contradiction as a Materialist, who believes in nothing beyond
          the Atom, might think. There is a difference between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifested</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unmanifested</span></em> Matter, between
          Pradhâna, the beginningless and endless cause, and Prakriti, or the
          manifested effect. Says the Shloka:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How are these
          two propositions—that <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter is
          eternal,”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Atom is
          periodical, and not eternal”</span>—viewed by exact Modern Science?
          The materialistic Physicist will criticize and laugh them to scorn.
          The liberal and progressive man of Science, however, the true and
          earnest scientific searcher after truth, such as the eminent
          Chemist, Mr. Crookes, will corroborate the probability of the two
          statements. For hardly had the echo of his lecture on the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Genesis of the Elements”</span> died
          away—the lecture which, delivered by him before the Chemical
          Section of the British Association, at the Birmingham meeting in
          1887, so startled every evolutionist who heard or read it—than
          there came another in March, 1888. Once more the President of the
          Chemical Society brought before the world of Science and the public
          the fruits of some new discoveries in the realm of Atoms, and these
          discoveries justified the Occult Teachings in every way. They are
          more startling even than the statements made by him in the first
          lecture, and well deserve the attention of every Occultist,
          Theosophist, and Metaphysician. This is what he says in his
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Elements and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meta</span></span>-Elements,”</span> thus
          justifying Stallo's charges and prevision, with the fearlessness of
          a scientific mind which loves Science for truth's sake, regardless
          of any consequences to his own glory and reputation. We quote his
          own words:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Permit me, gentlemen, now to draw your attention
          for a short time to a subject which concerns the fundamental
          principles of chemistry, a subject which may lead us to admit the
          possible existence of bodies which, though neither compounds nor
          mixtures, are not elements in the strictest sense of the
          word—bodies which I venture to call</span> <span class="tei tei-q">
<span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">meta-elements.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">To
            explain my meaning it is necessary for me to revert to our
            conception of an element. What is the criterion of an element?
            Where are we to draw the line between distinct existence and
            identity? No one doubts that oxygen, sodium, chlorine, sulphur
            are separate elements; and when we come to such groups as
            chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc., we still feel no doubt, although
            were degrees of</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">elementicity</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">admissible—and to that we may ultimately have to
            come—it might be allowed that chlorine approximates much more
            closely to bromine than to oxygen, sodium, or sulphur. Again,
            nickel and cobalt are near to each other, very near, though no
            one questions their claim to rank as distinct elements. Still I
            cannot help asking what would have been the prevalent</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page597">[pg 597]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg597"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">opinion among chemists had the respective
            solutions of these bodies and their compounds presented identical
            colours, instead of colours which, approximately speaking, are
            mutually complementary. Would their distinct nature have even now
            been recognized? When we pass further and come to the so-called
            rare earths the ground is less secure under our feet. Perhaps we
            may admit scandium, ytterbium, and others of the like sort to
            elemental rank; but what are we to say in the case of praseo- and
            neo-dymium, between which there may be said to exist no
            well-marked chemical difference, their chief claim to separate
            individuality being slight differences in basicity and
            crystallizing powers, though their physical distinctions, as
            shown by spectrum observations, are very strongly marked? Even
            here we may imagine the disposition of the majority of chemists
            would incline toward the side of leniency, so that they would
            admit these two bodies within the charmed circle. Whether in so
            doing they would be able to appeal to any broad principle is an
            open question. If we admit these candidates how in justice are we
            to exclude the series of elemental bodies or meta-elements made
            known to us by Krüss and Nilson? Here the spectral differences
            are well marked, while my own researches on didymium show also a
            slight difference in basicity between some at least of these
            doubtful bodies. In the same category must be included the
            numerous separate</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">elements</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">—commonly so-called—have been and are being
            split up. Where then are we to draw the line? The different
            groupings shade off so imperceptibly the one into the other that
            it is impossible to erect a definite boundary between any two
            adjacent bodies and to say that the body on this side of the line
            is an element, while the one on the other side is non-elementary,
            or merely something which simulates or approximates to an
            element. Wherever an apparently reasonable line might be drawn it
            would no doubt be easy at once to assign most bodies to their
            proper side, as in all cases of classification the real
            difficulty comes in when the border-line is approached. Slight
            chemical differences, of course, are admitted, and, up to a
            certain point, so are well-marked physical differences. What are
            we to say, however, when the only chemical difference is an
            almost imperceptible tendency for the one body—of a couple or of
            a group—to precipitate before the other? Again, there are cases
            where the chemical differences reach the vanishing point,
            although well-marked physical differences still remain. Here we
            stumble on a new difficulty: in such obscurities what is chemical
            and what is physical? Are we not entitled to call a slight
            tendency of a nascent amorphous precipitate to fall down in
            advance of another a</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">physical
            difference</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">?
            And may we not call coloured reactions depending on the amount of
            some particular acid present and varying, according to the
            concentration of the solution and to the solvent employed,</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">chemical
            differences</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">? I
            do not see how we can deny elementary character to a body which
            differs from another by well-marked colour, or
            spectrum-reactions, while we accord it to another body whose only
            claim is a very minute difference in basic powers. Having once
            opened the door wide enough to admit some spectrum differences,
            we have to inquire how minute a difference qualifies the
            candidate to pass? I will give instances from my own experience
            of some of these doubtful candidates.</span></p>

          however minute, still show that none of them are simple bodies, and
          that the 60 or 70 elements accepted in chemistry can no longer

            are to the atoms of any other approximating element. It does not
            necessarily follow that the atoms shall all be absolutely alike
            among themselves. The atomic weight which we ascribed to yttrium,
            therefore, merely represents a mean value around which the actual

            should find them varying within narrow limits on each side of the

          unconsciously, who knoweth? For he says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Until lately such bodies passed muster as
          elements. They had definite properties, chemical and physical; they
          had recognized atomic weights. If we take a</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page599">[pg 599]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg599"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">pure
            dilute solution of such a body, yttrium for instance, and if we
            add to it an excess of strong ammonia, we obtain a precipitate
            which appears perfectly homogeneous. But if instead we add very
            dilute ammonia in quantity sufficient only to precipitate
            one-half of the base present, we obtain no immediate precipitate.
            If we stir up the whole thoroughly so as to insure a uniform
            mixture of the solution and the ammonia, and set the vessel aside
            for an hour, carefully excluding dust, we may still find the
            liquid clear and bright, without any vestige of turbidity. After
            three or four hours, however, an opalescence will declare itself,
            and the next morning a precipitate will have appeared. Now let us
            ask ourselves, What can be the meaning of this phenomenon? The
            quantity of precipitant added was insufficient to throw down more
            than half the yttria present, therefore a process akin to
            selection has been going on for several hours. The precipitation
            has</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">evidently not been effected
            at random</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, those
            molecules of the base being decomposed which happened to come in
            contact with a corresponding molecule of ammonia, for we have
            taken care that the liquids should be uniformly mixed, so that
            one molecule of the original salt would not be more exposed to
            decomposition than any other. If, further, we consider the time
            which elapses before the appearance of a precipitate, we</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">cannot avoid coming to the
            conclusion that the action which has been going on for the first
            few hours is of a selective character</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. The problem is not why a precipitate is
            produced, but what determines or directs some atoms to fall down
            and others to remain in solution. Out of the multitude of atoms
            present,</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">what power is it that
            directs each atom to choose the proper path? We may picture to
            ourselves some directive force passing the atoms one by one in
            review, selecting one for precipitation and another for solution
            till all have been adjusted.</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The italics in
          the above passage are ours. Well may a man of Science ask himself:
          What power is it that directs each Atom? and what is the meaning of
          its character being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">selective</span></em>? Theists would solve the
          question by answering <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span>; and
          would thereby solve nothing philosophically. Occultism answers on
          its own Pantheistic grounds, and teaches the student about Gods,
          Monads, and Atoms. The learned lecturer sees in it that which is
          his chief concern: the finger-posts and the traces of a path which
          may lead to the discovery, and the full and complete demonstration,
          of an homogeneous element in Nature. He remarks:</p>

          one of basicity, so slight as to be imperceptible by any test at
          present known, but susceptible of being nursed and encouraged to a
          point when the difference can be appreciated by ordinary

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every one knows

          original symbol—with the triple head of the serpent—became altered
          into a rod with a knob, and the two lower heads were separated,
          thus disfiguring somewhat the original meaning. Yet it is as good
          an illustration as can be for our purpose, this laya rod, entwined
          by two serpents. Verily the wonderful powers of the magic Caduceus

          more:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

          asked my audience to picture the action of two forces on the
          original protyle—one being time, accompanied by a lowering of
          temperature; the other, swinging to and fro like a mighty pendulum,
          having periodic cycles of ebb and swell, rest and activity, being
          intimately connected</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page601">
            [pg 601]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg601"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">with the
            imponderable matter, essence, or source of energy we call
            electricity. Now, a simile like this effects its object if it
            fixes in the mind the particular fact it is intended to
            emphasize, but it must not be expected necessarily to run
            parallel with all the facts. Besides the lowering of temperature
            with the periodic ebb and flow of electricity, positive or
            negative, requisite to confer on the newly-born elements their
            particular atomicity, it is evident that a third factor must be
            taken into account. Nature does not act on a flat plane; she
            demands space for her cosmogenic operations, and if we introduce
            space as the third factor, all appears clear. Instead of a
            pendulum, which, though to a certain extent a good illustration,
            is impossible as a fact, let us seek some more satisfactory way
            of representing what I conceive may have taken place. Let us
            suppose the zigzag diagram not drawn upon a plane, but projected
            in space of three dimensions. What figure can we best select to
            meet all the conditions involved? Many of the facts can be well
            explained by supposing the projection in space of Professor
            Emerson Reynolds' zigzag curve to be a spiral. This figure is,
            however, inadmissible, inasmuch as the curve has to pass through
            a point neutral as to electricity and chemical energy twice in
            each cycle. We must, therefore, adopt some other figure. A figure
            of eight (8), or lemniscate, will foreshorten into a zigzag just
            as well as a spiral, and it fulfils every condition of the
            problem.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A lemniscate for
          the evolution downward, from Spirit into Matter; another form of a

          with the greatest security and confidence to Science, to be
          justified some day. Let us hear some more, however, about this
          primordial genetic type of the symbolical Caduceus.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

          simultaneous motions. First, a simple oscillation backwards and

          right angles to the former (suppose north and south) of half the
          periodic time—</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">,
            twice as fast; and thirdly, a motion at right angles to these two
            (suppose downwards), which, in its simplest form, would be with
            unvarying velocity. If we project this figure in space we find on
            examination that the points of the curves, where chlorine,
            bromine, and iodine are formed, come close under each other; so
            also will sulphur, selenium, and tellurium; again, phosphorus,
            arsenic, and antimony; and in like manner other series of
            analogous bodies. It may be asked whether this scheme explains
            how and why the elements appear in this order? Let us imagine a
            cyclical translation in space, each evolution witnessing the
            genesis of the group of elements which I previously represented
            as produced during one complete vibration of the pendulum. Let us
            suppose that one cycle has thus been completed, the centre of the
            unknown creative force in its mighty journey through space having
            scattered along its track the primitive atoms—the</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page602">[pg 602]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg602"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">seeds, if I may use the expression—which
            presently are to coalesce and develop into the groupings now
            known as lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen,
            fluorine, sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, phosphorus,
            sulphur, and chlorine. What is most probably the form of track
            now pursued? Were it strictly confined to the same plane of
            temperature and time, the next elementary groupings to appear
            would again have been those of lithium, and the original cycle
            would have been eternally repeated, producing again and again the
            same 14 elements. The conditions, however, are not quite the
            same. Space and electricity are as at first, but temperature has
            altered, and thus, instead of the atoms of lithium being
            supplemented with atoms in all respects analogous with
            themselves, the atomic groupings which come into being when the
            second cycle commences form, not lithium, but its lineal
            descendant, potassium. Suppose, therefore, the</span>
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">vis
            generatrix</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">travelling
            to and fro in cycles along a lemniscate path, as above suggested,
            while simultaneously temperature is declining and time is flowing
            on—variations which I have endeavoured to represent by the
            downward sink—each coil of the lemniscate track crosses the same
            vertical line at lower and lower points. Projected in space, the
            curve shows a central line neutral as far as electricity is
            concerned, and neutral in chemical properties—positive
            electricity on the north, negative on the south. Dominant
            atomicities are governed by the distance east and west from the
            neutral centre line, monatomic elements being one remove from it,
            diatomic two removes, and so on. In every successive coil the
            same law holds good.</span></p>

          extinction of the Solar Fires and the destruction of the
          Universe—is quite erroneous on the lines traced by men of Science.

          we may, I think, premise that the heat radiations propagated
          outwards through the ether from the ponderable matter of the
          universe, by some process of nature not yet known to us, are
          transformed at the confines of the universe into the primary—the
          essential—motions of chemical atoms, which, the instant they are
          formed, gravitate inwards, and thus restore to the universe the
          energy which otherwise would be lost to it through radiant heat. If
          this conjecture be well founded, Sir William Thomson's startling
          prediction of the final decrepitude of the universe through the
          dissipation of its energy falls to the ground. In this fashion,

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Matter in motion,”</span> and a
          manifestation of Energy; or that Matter and Force are the
          phenomenal differentiated aspects of the one primary,
          undifferentiated Cosmic Substance?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This query is
          made with regard to that Stanza which treats of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fohat</span></span> and his <span class="tei tei-q">“Seven brothers or Sons,”</span> in other words, of the

          of Cosmic Electricity, the Brothers or Sons of Occult parlance
          being the seven primary forces of Electricity, whose purely
          phenomenal, and hence grossest, effects are alone cognizable by
          Physicists on the cosmic and especially on the terrestrial plane.
          These include, among other things, Sound, Light, Colour, etc. Now
          what does Physical Science tell us of these <span class="tei tei-q">“Forces”</span>? <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sound</span></span>, it says, is a
          sensation produced by the impact of atmospheric molecules on the
          tympanum, which, by setting up delicate tremors in the auditory
          apparatus, thus communicate their vibrations to the brain.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Light</span></span> is the sensation
          caused by the impact of inconceivably minute vibrations of ether on
          the retina of the eye.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So, too, say we.
          But these are simply the effects produced in our atmosphere and its
          immediate surroundings, all, in fact, which falls within the range
          of our terrestrial consciousness. Jupiter Pluvius sent his symbol
          in drops of rain, of water composed, as is believed, of two
          <span class="tei tei-q">“elements,”</span> which Chemistry
          dissociates and recombines. The compound molecules are in its
          power, but their atoms still elude its grasp. Occultism sees in all
          these Forces and manifestations a ladder, the lower rungs of which
          belong to exoteric Physics, and the higher are traced to a living,
          intelligent, invisible Power, which is, as a rule, the unconcerned,
          but, exceptionally, the conscious, Cause of the sense-born
          phenomena designated as this or that natural law.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page606">[pg 606]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg606"></a>

          maintain that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Sound</span></span>, for one thing, is a
          tremendous Occult power; that it is a stupendous force, of which
          the electricity generated by a million of Niagaras could never
          counteract the smallest potentiality when directed with Occult
          Knowledge. Sound may be produced of such a nature that the pyramid
          of Cheops would be raised in the air, or that a dying man, nay, one
          at his last breath, would be revived and filled with new energy and
          vigour.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For Sound

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And if all this
          appears too <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unscientific</span></em> to be even noticed,
          let Science explain to what mechanical and physical laws, known to
          it, are due the recently produced phenomena of the so-called Keely
          motor. What is it that acts as the formidable generator of
          invisible but tremendous force, of that power which is not only
          capable of driving an engine of 25 horse-power, but has even been
          employed to bodily lift the machinery? Yet this is done simply by
          drawing a fiddle-bow across a tuning fork, as has been repeatedly
          proven. For the Etheric Force, discovered by John Worrell Keely, of
          Philadelphia, well-known in America and Europe, is no
          hallucination. Notwithstanding his failure to utilize it—a failure
          prognosticated and maintained by some Occultists from the first—the
          phenomena exhibited by the discoverer during the last few years
          have been wonderful, almost miraculous, not in the sense of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supernatural</span></em><a href="#note_949" id="noteref_949" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> but
          of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">superhuman</span></em>. Had Keely been
          permitted to succeed, he might have reduced a whole army to atoms
          in the space of a few seconds, as easily as he reduced a dead ox to
          that condition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader is
          now asked to give serious attention to that newly-discovered
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page607">[pg 607]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg607"></a> potency, which the
          discoverer has named Inter-Etheric Force, and Forces.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the humble
          opinion of the Occultists, as of his immediate friends, Mr. Keely
          was, and still is, at the threshold of some of the greatest secrets
          of the Universe; of that chiefly on which is built the whole
          mystery of physical Forces, and the Esoteric significance of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mundane Egg”</span> symbolism. Occult
          Philosophy, viewing the manifested and the unmanifested Kosmos as a
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">unity</span></span>, symbolizes the
          ideal conception of the former by that <span class="tei tei-q">“Golden Egg”</span> with two poles in it. It is the
          positive pole that acts in the manifested World of Matter, while
          the negative loses itself in the unknowable Absoluteness of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">sat</span></span>—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Be-ness</span></em>.<a href="#note_950" id="noteref_950" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a>
          Whether this agrees with the philosophy of Mr. Keely, we cannot
          tell, nor does it really much matter. Nevertheless, his ideas about
          the ethero-material construction of the Universe look strangely
          like our own, being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in this respect</span></em> nearly identical.
          This is what we find him saying in an able pamphlet compiled by
          Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, an American lady of wealth and position,
          whose incessant efforts in the pursuit of truth can never be too
          highly appreciated:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Mr. Keely, in explanation of the working of his
          engine, says:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">In the
          conception of any machine heretofore constructed, the medium for
          inducing a neutral centre has never been found. If it had, the
          difficulties of perpetual-motion seekers would have ended, and this
          problem would have become an established and operating fact. It
          would only require an introductory impulse of a few pounds, on such
          a device, to cause it to run for centuries. In the conception of my
          vibratory engine, I did not seek to attain perpetual motion; but a
          circuit is formed that actually has</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">a
          neutral centre</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, which is
          in a condition to be vivified by my vibratory ether, and, while
          under operation by said substance, is really a machine that is
          virtually independent of the mass (or globe),</span><a href="#note_951" id="noteref_951" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">and it is the wonderful velocity of
          the vibratory circuit which makes it so. Still, with all its
          perfection, it requires to be fed with the vibratory ether to make
          it an independent motor.... All structures require a foundation in
          strength according to the weight of the mass they have to carry,
          but the foundations of the universe rest on a vacuous point far
          more minute than a molecule; in fact, to express this truth
          properly, on an</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">inter-etheric
          point</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">, which requires an
          infinite mind to understand it. To look down into the depths of an
          etheric centre is precisely the same as it would be to search into
          the broad space of heaven's ether to find the end, with this
          difference: that one is the positive field, while the other is the
          negative field.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is, as may
          easily be seen, precisely the Eastern Doctrine. Mr. Keely's
          inter-etheric point is the laya-point of the Occultists; this,
          however, does not require <span class="tei tei-q">“an infinite mind
          to understand it,”</span> but only a specific intuition and ability
          to trace its hiding-place in this World of Matter. Of course, the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">laya
          centre</span></span> cannot be produced, but an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inter-etheric
          vacuum</span></span> can be—as is proved by the production of
          bell-sounds in space. Mr. Keely speaks as an unconscious Occultist,
          nevertheless, when he remarks, in his theory of planetary
          suspension:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">As regards planetary volume, we would ask in a
          scientific point of view, How can the immense difference of volume
          in the planets exist without disorganizing the harmonious action
          that has always characterized them? I can only answer this question
          properly by entering into a progressive analysis, starting on the
          rotating etheric centres that were fixed by the
            Creator</span><a href="#note_952" id="noteref_952" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">with their attractive or
            accumulative power. If you ask what power it is that gives to
            each etheric atom its inconceivable velocity of rotation (or
            introductory impulse), I must answer that no finite mind will
            ever be able to conceive what it is. The philosophy of
            accumulation is the only proof that such a power has been given.
            The area, if we can so speak, of such an atom presents to the
            attractive or magnetic, the elective or propulsive, all the
            receptive force and all the antagonistic force that characterize
            a planet of the largest magnitude; consequently, as the
            accumulation goes on, the perfect equation remains the same. When
            this minute centre has once been fixed, the power to rend it from
            its position would necessarily have to be so great as to displace
            the most immense planet that exists. When this atomic neutral
            centre is displaced, the planet must go with it. The neutral
            centre carries the full load of any accumulation from the start,
            and remains the same, for ever balanced in the eternal
            space.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Keely
          illustrates his idea of <span class="tei tei-q">“a neutral
          centre”</span> in this way:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">We will imagine that, after an accumulation of a
          planet of any diameter, say, 20,000 miles, more or less, for the
          size has nothing to do with the problem, there should be a
          displacement of all the material, with the exception of a crust
          5,000 miles thick, leaving an intervening void between this crust
          and a centre of the size of an ordinary billiard ball, it would
          then require a force as great to move this small central mass as it
          would to move the shell of 5,000 miles thickness. Moreover, this
          small central mass would carry the load of this crust for ever,
          keeping it equidistant; and there could be no opposing power,
          however great, that could bring them together. The imagination
          staggers in contemplating the immense load which bears upon this
          point of centre, where weight ceases.... This is what we understand
          by a neutral centre.</span></p>

          speculative Science, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exact</span></em>, are therefore ours in this
          particular—what can Science answer to facts already seen, which it
          is no longer possible for anyone to deny? Occult Philosophy
          divulges few of its most important vital mysteries. It drops them
          like precious pearls, one by one, far and wide apart, and even this
          only when forced to do so by the evolutionary tidal wave that
          carries on Humanity slowly, silently, but steadily, toward the dawn
          of the Sixth Race mankind. For once out of the safe custody of
          their legitimate heirs and keepers, those mysteries cease to be
          Occult: they fall into the public domain, and have to run the risk
          of becoming curses more often than blessings in the hands of the
          selfish—of the Cains of the human race. Nevertheless, whenever such
          individuals as the discoverer of Etheric Force are born, men with
          peculiar psychic and mental capacities,<a href="#note_953" id="noteref_953" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> they
          are generally and more frequently helped, than allowed to go
          unassisted, groping on their way; if left to their own resources,
          they very soon fall victims to martyrdom or become the prey of
          unscrupulous speculators. But they are helped only on the condition
          that they should not become, whether consciously or unconsciously,
          an additional peril to their age: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a danger to the

          years back, during the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition, the
          writer, in answering the earnest queries of a Theosophist, one of
          the earliest admirers of Mr. Keely, repeated to him what she had
          heard in quarters, information from which she could never
          doubt.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had been
          stated that the inventor of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Self-Motor”</span> was what is called, in the jargon
          of the Kabalists, a <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">natural-born</span></em> magician.”</span>
          That he was and would remain unconscious of the full range of his
          powers, and would work out merely those which he had found out and
          ascertained in his own nature—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">firstly</span></em>, because, attributing them
          to a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page610">[pg 610]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg610"></a> wrong source, he
          could never give them full sway; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secondly</span></em>, because it was beyond
          his power to pass to others that which was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a capacity inherent
          in his own special nature</span></em>. Hence, the whole secret
          could not be made over permanently to anyone, for practical
          purposes or use.<a href="#note_955" id="noteref_955" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">955</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Individuals born
          with such a capacity are not very rare. That they are not heard of
          more frequently is due to the fact that they live and die, in
          almost every case, in utter ignorance that they are possessed of
          abnormal powers. Mr. Keely possesses powers which are called
          abnormal, just because they happen to be as little known, in our
          day, as was the circulation of the blood before Harvey's time.
          Blood existed, and it behaved as it does at present in the first
          man born from woman; and so exists and has existed in man that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">principle</span></em> which can control and
          guide etheric vibratory Force. At any rate, it exists in all those
          mortals whose <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inner Selves</span></em> are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">primordially
          connected, by reason of their direct descent, with that group of
          Dhyân-Chohans</span></span> who are called <span class="tei tei-q">“the first-born of Æther.”</span> Mankind, psychically
          considered, is divided into various groups, each group being
          connected with one of the Dhyânic Groups that first formed
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">psychic</span></em> man (see paragraphs 1, 2,
          3, 4, 5 in the Commentary to Stanza VII.). Mr. Keely—being greatly
          favoured in this respect, and besides his psychic temperament,
          being, moreover, intellectually a genius in mechanics—may achieve
          most wonderful results. He has achieved some already—more than any
          mortal man, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not initiated into the final
          Mysteries</span></em>, has achieved in this age up to the present
          day. What he has done is—as his friends justly say of him—certainly
          quite sufficient <span class="tei tei-q">“to demolish with the
          hammer of Science the idols of Science”</span>—the idols of matter
          with the feet of clay. Nor would the writer for a moment think of
          contradicting Mrs. Bloomfield-Moore, when, in her paper on
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Psychic Force and Etheric Force,”</span>
          she states that Mr. Keely, as a Philosopher:</p>

          researches, overcoming the colossal difficulties which again and
          again raised up in his path what seemed to be (to all but himself)
          insurmountable barriers to further progress: but never has the
          world's index finger so pointed to an hour when all is making ready
          for the advent of the new form of force that mankind is waiting
          for. Nature, always reluctant to yield her secrets, is listening to
          the demands made upon her by her master, necessity. The coal mines
          of the world cannot long afford the increasing drain made upon
          them. Steam has reached its utmost limits of power, and does not
          fulfil the requirements of the age. It knows that its days are
          numbered. Electricity holds back, with bated breath, dependent upon
          the approach of her sister colleague. Air ships are riding at
          anchor, as it were, waiting for the force which is to make aërial
          navigation something more than a dream. As easily as men
          communicate with their offices from their homes by means of the
          telephone, so will the inhabitants of separate continents talk

          this marvellous discovery, when once it is applied to art and
          mechanics. In taking the throne which it will force steam to
          abdicate, dynaspheric force will rule the world with a power so
          mighty in the interests of civilization, that no finite mind can
          conjecture the results. Laurence Oliphant, in his preface to</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Scientific

          way could this new moral future be so widely, so universally,
          commenced as by the utilizing of dynaspheric force to beneficial
          purposes in life.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Occultists
          are ready to admit all this with the eloquent writer. Molecular
          vibration is, undeniably, <span class="tei tei-q">“Keely's

          him will prove wonderful—yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only in his hands</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through
          himself</span></em>. The world so far will get but that with which
          it can be safely entrusted. The truth of this assertion has,
          perhaps, not yet quite dawned upon the discoverer himself, since he
          writes that he is absolutely certain that he will accomplish all
          that he has promised, and that he will then give it out to the
          world; but it must dawn upon him, and at no very far distant date.
          And what he says in reference to his work is a good proof of
          it:</p>

          steam-engine</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. My engine
          has neither piston nor eccentrics, nor is there one grain of

          other principle.... This, however, is the true system; and
          henceforth all my operations will be conducted in this manner—that
          is to say, my power will be generated, my engines run, my cannon

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passages
          underlined by us, are those which bear directly on the Occult side
          of the application of the vibratory Force, that which Mr. Keely
          calls <span class="tei tei-q">“sympathetic vibration.”</span> The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“wire”</span> is already a step below, or
          downward from the pure Etheric plane into the Terrestrial. The
          discoverer has produced marvels—the word <span class="tei tei-q">“miracle”</span> is not too <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page613">[pg 613]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg613"></a> strong—when acting through the inter-etheric
          Force alone, the fifth and sixth principles of Âkâsha. From a
          generator six feet long, he has come down to one <span class="tei tei-q">“no larger than an old-fashioned silver watch”</span>;
          and this by itself is a miracle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em>, but not of spiritual,
          genius. As was well said by his great patroness and defender, Mrs.

          the same results</span></em>. It was truly Keely's Ether that
          acted, while Smith's or Brown's Ether would have remained for ever
          barren of results. For Keely's difficulty has hitherto been to
          produce a machine which would develop and regulate the Force
          without the intervention of any <span class="tei tei-q">“will
          power”</span> or personal influence of the operator, whether
          conscious or unconscious. In this he has failed, so far as others
          were concerned, for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no one but himself</span></em> could operate
          on his <span class="tei tei-q">“machines.”</span> Occultly this was
          a far more advanced achievement than the <span class="tei tei-q">“success”</span> which he anticipates from his wire,

          of commerce and traffic</span></span>. That Keely's organism is
          directly connected with the production of his marvellous results is
          proven by the following statement, emanating from one who knows the

            operated at once. Again the other tried, but without success.
            Then Keely put his hand on his shoulder and told him to try once

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the realm of the fourth Son of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the question
          is asked why Mr. Keely was not allowed to pass a certain limit, the
          answer is easy; it was because that, which he has unconsciously
          discovered, is the terrible sidereal Force, known to, and named by
          the Atlanteans Mash-mak, and by the Âryan Rishis in their Astra
          Vidyâ by a name that we do not like to give. It is the Vril of
          Bulwer Lytton's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Coming Race</span></span>, and of the coming
          Races of our mankind. The name Vril may be a fiction; the Force
          itself is a fact, as little doubted in India as is the existence of
          the Rishis, since it is mentioned in all the secret books.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is this
          vibratory Force, which, when aimed at an army from an Agni-ratha,
          fixed on a flying vessel, a balloon, according to the instructions
          found in Astra Vidyâ, would reduce to ashes 100,000 men and
          elephants, as easily as it would a dead rat. It is allegorized in
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu Purâna</span></span>, in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Râmâyana</span></span> and other works, in the
          fable about the sage Kapila whose <span class="tei tei-q">“glance
          made a mountain of ashes of King Sagara's 60,000 sons,”</span> and
          which is explained in the Esoteric Works, and referred to as the
          Kapilâksha—Kapila's Eye.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And is it this
          Satanic Force that our generations are to be allowed to add to
          their stock of Anarchist's baby-toys, known as melenite, dynamite
          clock-work, explosive oranges, <span class="tei tei-q">“flower
          baskets,”</span> and such other innocent names? Is it this
          destructive agency, which, once in the hands of some modern Attila,
          a bloodthirsty Anarchist, for instance, would in a few days reduce
          Europe to its primitive chaotic state, with no man left alive to
          tell the tale—is it this Force which is to become the common
          property of all men alike?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What Mr. Keely
          has already done is grand and wonderful in the extreme; there is
          enough work before him in the demonstration of his new system to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“humble the pride of those scientists who
          are materialistic, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page615">[pg

          all. For surely Psychics and Spiritualists, of whom there are a
          good number in European armies, would be the first to personally
          experience the fruits of the revelation of such mysteries.
          Thousands of them would speedily find themselves in blue Ether,
          perhaps with the populations of whole countries to keep them
          company, were such a Force to be even entirely discovered, let
          alone made publicly known. The discovery in its completeness is by
          several thousand—or shall we say hundred thousand—years too
          premature. It will be in its appointed place and time only when the
          great roaring flood of starvation, misery, and underpaid labour
          ebbs back again—as it will when the just demands of the many are at
          last happily attended to; when the proletariat exists but in name,
          and the pitiful cry for bread, that rings unheeded throughout the
          world, has died away. This may be hastened by the spread of
          learning, and by new openings for work and emigration, with better
          prospects than now exist, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and on some new continent that may
          appear</span></em>. Then only will Keely's Motor and Force, as
          originally contemplated by himself and his friends, be in demand,
          because it will then be more needed by the poor than by the
          wealthy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile the
          Force he has discovered will work through wires, and, if he
          succeeds, this will be quite sufficient to make of him the greatest
          discoverer of the age in the present generation.</p>

          physicists of the present day, a wild freak of the imagination.
          Possibly, in time, a light may fall upon this theory that will
          bring its simplicity forward for scientific research. At present I
          can only compare it to some planet in a dark space, where the light
          of the sun of science has not yet reached it.... I assume that
          sound, like odour, is a real substance of unknown and wonderful
          tenuity, emanating from a body where it has been induced by
          percussion and throwing out absolute corpuscles of matter,
          inter-atomic particles, with velocity of 1,120 feet per
          second;</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in vacuo</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">20,000. The substance which is thus
          disseminated is a part and parcel of the mass agitated, and, if
          kept under this agitation continuously, would, in the course of a
          certain cycle of time, become thoroughly absorbed by the
          atmosphere; or, more truly, would pass through the atmosphere to an
          elevated point of tenuity corresponding to the condition of
          sub-division that governs its liberation from its parent body....
          The sounds from vibratory forks, set so as to produce etheric
          chords, while disseminating their tones (compound), permeate most
          thoroughly all substances that come under the range of their atomic
          bombardment. The clapping of a bell</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">
            in vacuo</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">liberates
            these atoms with the same velocity and volume as one in the open
            air; and were the agitation of the bell kept up continuously for
            a few millions of centuries it would thoroughly return to its
            primitive element; and, if the chamber were hermetically sealed,
            and strong enough, the vacuous volume surrounding the bell would
            be brought to a pressure of many thousands of pounds to the
            square inch, by the tenuous substance evolved. In my estimation,
            sound truly defined is the disturbance of atomic equilibrium,
            rupturing actual atomic corpuscles; and the substance thus
            liberated must certainly be a certain order of etheric flow.
            Under these conditions, is it unreasonable to suppose that, if
            this flow were kept up, and the body thus robbed of its element,
            it would in time disappear entirely? All bodies are formed
            primitively from this highly tenuous ether, animal, vegetable,
            and mineral, and they are only returned to their high gaseous
            condition when brought under a state of differential
            equilibrium.... As regards odour, we can only get some definite
            idea of its extreme and wondrous tenuity by taking into
            consideration that a large area of atmosphere can be impregnated
            for a long series of years from a single grain of musk; which, if
            weighed after that long interval, will be found to be not
            appreciably diminished. The great paradox attending the flow of
            odorous particles is that they can be held under confinement in a
            glass vessel! Here is a substance of much higher tenuity than the
            glass that holds it, and yet it cannot escape. It is as a sieve
            with its meshes large enough to pass marbles, and yet holding
            fine sand which cannot pass through; in fact, a molecular vessel
            holding an atomic substance. This is a problem that would
            confound those who stop to recognize it. But infinitely tenuous
            as odour is, it holds a very crude relation to the substance of
            sub-division that governs a magnetic flow (a flow of sympathy, if
            you please to call it so). This sub-division comes next to sound,
            but is above sound. The action of the flow of a magnet coincides
            somewhat to the receiving and distributing portion of the human
            brain, giving off at all times a depreciating ratio of the amount
            received. It is a grand illustration of the control of mind over
            matter, which gradually depreciates the physical till dissolution
            takes place. The</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page617">[pg

            same ratio gradually loses its power and becomes inert. If the
            relations that exist between mind and matter could be equated and
            so held, we would live on in our physical state eternally, as
            there would be no physical depreciation. But this physical
            depreciation leads, at its terminus, to the source of a much
            higher development—viz., the liberation of the pure ether from
            the crude molecular; which, in my estimation, is to be much
            desired.</span><a href="#note_959" id="noteref_959" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">959</span></span></a></p>

          of Modern Science, however much the latter may protest against
          these novel views. In all its fundamental principles, if not in its

          modern Natural Philosophy as well.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This new Force,
          or whatever Science may call it, the effects of which are
          undeniable—as is admitted by more than one Naturalist and Physicist
          who has visited Mr. Keely's laboratory and personally witnessed its

          proximate, the immediate, cause of such sensations, we as
          absolutely reject the one-sided scientific theory that there is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no

          have a perception, or be stimulated into action, without some
          substantial force coming in contact with it. This is the
          fundamental law pervading the whole organic and mental world. In
          the true philosophical sense there is no such thing as independent

          those geological ages, the duration of which it is found as
          impossible to determine—according to the opinion of one of the best
          English Geologists<a href="#note_960" id="noteref_960" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a>—as
          the nature of Matter, it is because he knows what he is talking
          about. When he says Man and Elements, he means neither man in his
          present physiological and anthropological form, nor the elemental
          Atoms, those hypothetical conceptions, existing at present in
          scientific minds, the entitative abstractions of Matter in its
          highly attenuated state; nor, again, does he mean the compound
          Elements of Antiquity. In Occultism the word Element in every case
          means <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rudiment</span></span>. When we say
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Elementary Man,”</span> we mean either the
          proëmial, incipient sketch of man, in its unfinished and
          undeveloped condition, hence in that form which now lies latent in
          physical man during his life-time, and takes shape only
          occasionally and under certain conditions; or, that form which for
          a time survives the material body, and which is better known as an
          Elementary.<a href="#note_961" id="noteref_961" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">961</span></span></a> With
          regard to Element, when the term is used metaphysically, it means,
          in distinction to the mortal, the incipient Divine Man; and, in its
          physical usage, it means inchoate Matter in its first
          undifferentiated condition, or in the Laya state, the eternal and
          normal condition of Substance, which differentiates only
          periodically; during that differentiation, Substance is really in

          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page620">[pg 620]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg620"></a> the Hindû to Brahmâ,
          when he calls him Anu, the Atom. Every Elemental Atom, in search of
          which more than one Chemist has followed the path indicated by the
          Alchemists, is, in their firm belief, when not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, a Soul; not necessarily
          a disembodied Soul, but a Jîva, as the Hindûs call it, a centre of
          Potential Vitality, with latent intelligence in it, and, in the
          case of compound Souls, an intelligent active Existence, from the
          highest to the lowest order, a form composed of more or less
          differentiations. It requires a Metaphysician—and an Eastern
          Metaphysician—to understand our meaning. All those Atom-Souls are
          differentiations from the One, and are in the same relation to it
          as is the Divine Soul, Buddhi, to its informing and inseparable
          Spirit, Âtmâ.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Modern Physics,
          in borrowing from the Ancients their Atomic Theory, forgot one
          point, the most important point of the doctrine; hence they have
          got only the husks and will never be able to get the kernel. In
          adopting physical Atoms, they omitted the suggestive fact that,
          from Anaxagoras to Epicurus, to the Roman Lucretius, and finally
          even to Galileo, all these Philosophers believed more or less in
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">animated</span></em> Atoms, not in invisible
          specks of so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“brute”</span> matter.
          According to them, rotatory motion was generated by larger (read,
          more divine and pure) Atoms forcing other Atoms downwards; the
          lighter ones being simultaneously thrust upward. The Esoteric
          meaning of this is the ever cyclic curve of differentiated Elements
          downward and upward through intercyclic phases of existence, until
          each again reaches its starting-point or birthplace. The idea was
          metaphysical as well as physical; the hidden interpretation
          embracing Gods or Souls, in the shape of Atoms, as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">causes</span></em>
          of all the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effects</span></em> produced on Earth by the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secretions</span></em> from the divine
          bodies.<a href="#note_962" id="noteref_962" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> No
          Ancient Philosopher, not even the Jewish Kabalists, ever
          dissociated Spirit from Matter, or Matter from Spirit. Everything
          originated in the One, and, proceeding from the One, must finally
          return to the One.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Atoms and Souls

          which so many learned Jews have believed,<a href="#note_964" id="noteref_964" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">964</span></span></a> had
          no other meaning esoterically. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page621">[pg 621]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg621"></a> learned Jewish Initiates never meant
          Palestine alone by the Promised Land, but they meant the same

          Eternal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span>, symbolized by that of
          Abraham, and by Palestine as its substitute on Earth.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Surely no
          educated Jew ever believed this allegory in its literal sense, that
          the bodies of Jews contain within them a principle of Soul which
          cannot rest, if the bodies are deposited in a foreign land, until,
          by a process called the <span class="tei tei-q">“whirling of the

          meaning of this is evident to an Occultist. The process was
          supposed to be accomplished by a kind of metempsychosis, the
          psychic spark being conveyed through bird, beast, fish, and the
          most minute insect.<a href="#note_966" id="noteref_966" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">966</span></span></a> The
          allegory relates to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Atoms of the body</span></em>, each of which
          has to pass through every form, before all reach the final state,
          which is the first starting-point of the departure of every
          Atom—its primitive Laya state. But the primitive meaning of
          Gilgoolem, or the <span class="tei tei-q">“Revolution of
          Souls,”</span> was the idea of the reïncarnating Souls or Egos.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“All the Souls go into the
          Gilgoolah,”</span> into a cyclic or revolving process; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          they all proceed on the cyclic path of re-births. Some Kabalists
          interpret this doctrine to mean only a kind of purgatory for the
          souls of the wicked. But this is not so.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage of
          the Soul-Atom <span class="tei tei-q">“through the seven Planetary
          Chambers”</span> had the same metaphysical and physical meaning. It
          had the latter when it was said to dissolve into Ether. Even
          Epicurus, the model Atheist and Materialist, knew so much and
          believed so much in the ancient Wisdom, that he taught that the
          Soul—entirely distinct from immortal Spirit, when the former is
          enshrined <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">latent</span></em> in it, as it is in every
          atomic speck—was composed of a fine, tender essence, formed from
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">smoothest, roundest, and finest
          atoms</span></span>.<a href="#note_967" id="noteref_967" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">967</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this shows
          that the ancient Initiates, who were followed more or less closely
          by all profane Antiquity, meant by the term Atom, a Soul, a Genius
          or Angel, the first-born of the ever-concealed Cause of all causes;
          and in this sense their teachings become comprehensible. They
          asserted, as do their successors, the existence of Gods and Genii,
          Angels or Demons, not outside, nor independent of, the Universal
          Plenum, but within it. Only this Plenum, during the life-cycles, is
          infinite. They admitted and taught a good deal of that which modern
          Science now teaches—namely, the existence of a primordial
          World-Stuff <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page622">[pg
          622]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg622"></a>
          or Cosmic Substance, eternally homogeneous, except during its
          periodic existence; then, universally diffused throughout infinite
          Space, it differentiates, and gradually forms sidereal bodies from
          itself. They taught the revolution of the Heavens, the Earth's
          rotation, the Heliocentric System, and the Atomic Vortices—Atoms
          being in reality Souls and Intelligences. These <span class="tei tei-q">“Atomists”</span> were spiritual, most transcendental,
          and philosophical Pantheists. It is not they who would have ever
          conceived or dreamed that monstrous contrasted progeny, the
          nightmare of our modern civilized race: inanimate material and
          self-guiding Atoms, on the one hand, and an extra-cosmic God on the
          other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be useful
          to show what the Monad was, and what its origin, in the teachings
          of the old Initiates.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Modern exact
          Science, as soon as it began to grow out of its teens, perceived
          the great, and to it hitherto esoteric, axiom, that nothing,
          whether in the spiritual, psychic, or physical realm of Being,
          could come into existence out of nothing. There is no cause in the
          manifested Universe without its adequate effects, whether in Space
          or Time; nor can there be an effect without its primal cause, which
          itself owes its existence to a still higher one—the final and
          absolute Cause having to remain to man for ever an incomprehensible
          Causeless Cause. But even this is no solution, and must be viewed,
          if at all, from the highest philosophical and metaphysical
          standpoints, otherwise the problem had better be left unapproached.
          It is an abstraction, on the verge of which human reason—however
          trained in metaphysical subtleties—trembles, threatening to
          collapse. This may be demonstrated to any European, who would
          undertake to solve the problem of existence, by the articles of
          faith of the true Vedântin for instance. Let him read and study the
          sublime teachings of Shankarâchârya, on the subject of Soul and
          Spirit, and the reader will realize what is now said.<a href="#note_968" id="noteref_968" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">968</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the
          Christian is taught that the human Soul is a breath of God, being
          created by him for sempiternal existence, having a beginning, but
          no end—and therefore never to be called eternal—the Occult Teaching
          says: Nothing is created, it is only transformed. Nothing can
          manifest itself in this Universe—from a globe down to a vague,
          rapid thought—that was not in the Universe already; everything on
          the subjective plane is an eternal <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em>; as
          everything on the objective plane is an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ever-becoming</span></em>—because all is

          rendered as the Âtmâ, in conjunction with Buddhi and the higher
          Manas. This trinity is one and eternal, the latter being absorbed
          in the former at the termination of all conditioned and illusive
          life. The Monad, then, can be traced through the course of its
          pilgrimage and in its changes of transitory vehicles, only from the
          incipient stage of the manifested Universe. In Pralaya, the
          intermediate period between two Manvantaras, it loses its name, as
          it loses it when the real One Self of man merges into Brahman, in
          cases of high Samâdhi (the Turîya state), or final Nirvâna; in the
          words of Shankara:</p>

          that the Revised Version of the Gospels has been published and the
          most glaring mistranslations of the old versions are corrected, one

          witnesses,”</span> hitherto supposed to stand for <span class="tei tei-q">“the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost,”</span> show
          the real meaning of the writer very clearly, thus still more
          forcibly identifying his teaching in this respect with that of
          Shankarâchârya. For what can the sentence mean, <span class="tei tei-q">“there are three that bear witness ... the Spirit and
          the Water and the Blood”</span>—if it bears no relation to, nor
          connection with, the more philosophical statement of the great
          Vedântin teacher, who, speaking of the Sheaths—the principles in
          man—Jîva, Vijñânamaya, etc., which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em>, in
          their physical manifestation, <span class="tei tei-q">“Water and
          Blood”</span> or Life, adds that Âtmâ, Spirit, alone is what
          remains after the subtraction of the Sheaths and that it is the
          Only Witness, or synthesized unity. The less spiritual and
          philosophical school, solely with an eye to a Trinity, made three
          witnesses out of <span class="tei tei-q">“one,”</span> thus
          connecting it more with Earth than with Heaven. It is called in
          Esoteric Philosophy the <span class="tei tei-q">“One <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page624">[pg 624]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg624"></a> Witness,”</span> and, while it rests in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Âtmâ, our
          seventh principle, being identical with the Universal Spirit, and

          rays from the primeval Seven;—of which Seven something will be said
          further on. It is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">emanating Spark from the uncreated
          Ray</span></span>—a mystery. In the esoteric, and even exoteric
          Buddhism of the North, Âdi-Buddha (Chogi Dangpoi Sangye), the One
          Unknown, without beginning or end, identical with Parabrahman and
          Ain Suph, emits a bright Ray from its Darkness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the
          Logos, the First, or Vajradhara, the Supreme Buddha, also called
          Dorjechang. As the Lord of all Mysteries he cannot manifest, but
          sends into the world of manifestation his Heart—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Diamond Heart,”</span> Vajrasattva or Dorjesempa. This
          is the Second Logos of Creation, from whom emanate the seven—in the
          exoteric blind the five—Dhyâni-Buddhas, called the Anupâdaka, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Parentless.”</span> These Buddhas are the
          primeval Monads from the World of Incorporeal Being, the Arûpa
          World, wherein the Intelligences (on that plane only) have neither
          shape nor name, in the exoteric system, but have their distinct
          seven names in the Esoteric Philosophy. These Dhyâni-Buddhas
          emanate, or create from themselves, by virtue of Dhyâna, celestial
          Selves—the super-human Bodhisattvas. These, incarnating at the
          beginning of every human cycle on Earth as mortal men, become
          occasionally, owing to their personal merit, Bodhisattvas among the
          Sons of Humanity, after which they may reäppear as Mânushi, or
          Human, Buddhas. The Anupâdaka, or Dhyâni-Buddhas, are thus
          identical with the Brâhmanical Mânasaputra, Mind-born Sons—whether
          of Brahmâ, or of either of the other two Trimûrtian Hypostases;
          they are identical also with the Rishis and Prajâpatis. Thus, a

          their own Selves as Bodhisattvas or Brâhmanas, in heaven and earth,
          to become at last simple men. <span class="tei tei-q">“The creators
          of the world are born here, on earth again and again”</span>—truly.
          In the Northern Buddhist system, or the popular exoteric religion,
          it is taught that every Buddha, while preaching the Good Law on
          Earth, manifests himself simultaneously in three Worlds: in the
          Formless World as a Dhyâni-Buddha, in the World of Forms as a
          Bodhisattva, and in the World of Desire, the lowest or our World,
          as a man. Esoterically the teaching differs. The divine, purely
          Âdi-Buddhic Monad manifests as the universal Buddhi, the
          Mahâ-Buddhi or Mahat, in Hindû philosophies, the spiritual,
          omniscient and omnipotent Root of divine Intelligence, the highest
          Anima Mundi or the Logos. This descends <span class="tei tei-q">“like a flame spreading from the eternal Fire,
          immoveable, without increase or decrease, ever the same to the
          end”</span> of the cycle of existence, and becomes Universal Life
          on the Mundane Plane. From this Plane of conscious Life shoot out,
          like seven fiery tongues, the Sons of Light, the Logoi of Life;
          then the Dhyâni-Buddhas of contemplation, the concrete forms of
          their formless Fathers, the Seven Sons of Light, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still
          themselves</span></em>, to whom maybe applied the Brâhmanical
          mystic phrase: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">That</span></span>”</span>—Brahman. It
          is from these Dhyâni-Buddhas that emanate their Chhâyâs or Shadows,
          the Bodhisattvas of the celestial realms, the prototypes of the
          super-terrestrial Bodhisattvas, and of the terrestrial Buddhas, and
          finally of men. The Seven Sons of Light are also called
          Stars.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page626">[pg

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The star under
          which a human Entity is born, says the Occult Teaching, will remain
          for ever its star, throughout the whole cycle of its incarnations
          in one Manvantara. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">But this is not his astrological
          star.</span></em> The latter is concerned and connected with the

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Individuality</span></em>. The Angel of that
          Star, or the Dhyâni-Buddha connected with it, will be either the
          guiding, or simply the presiding, Angel, so to say, in every new
          rebirth of the Monad, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which is part of his own essence</span></em>,
          though his vehicle, man, may remain for ever ignorant of this fact.
          The Adepts have each their Dhyâni-Buddha, their elder <span class="tei tei-q">“Twin-Soul,”</span> and they know it, calling it
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Father-Soul,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Father-Fire.”</span> It is only at the last and
          supreme Initiation, however, when placed face to face with the
          bright <span class="tei tei-q">“Image”</span> that they learn to
          recognize it. How much did Bulwer Lytton know of this mystic fact,
          when describing, in one of his highest inspirational moods, Zanoni
          face to face with his Augoeides?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Logos, or
          both the unmanifested and the manifested Word, is called by the
          Hindûs, Îshvara, the Lord, though the Occultists give it another
          name. Îshvara, say the Vedântins, is the highest consciousness in
          Nature. <span class="tei tei-q">“This highest
          consciousness,”</span> answer the Occultists, <span class="tei tei-q">“is only a synthetic unit in the World of the
          manifested Logos—or on the plane of illusion; for it is the sum
          total of Dhyân Chohanic consciousness.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“O wise man, remove the conception that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Not-Spirit is
          Spirit</span></span>”</span>—says Shankarâchârya. Âtmâ is
          Not-Spirit in its final Parabrahmic state; Îshvara, or Logos, is
          Spirit; or, as Occultism explains, it is a compound unity of
          manifested living Spirits, the parent-source and nursery of all the
          mundane and terrestrial Monads, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">plus</span></em>
          their divine Reflection, which emanate from, and return into, the
          Logos, each in the culmination of its time. There are seven chief
          Groups of such Dhyân Chohans, which groups will be found and
          recognized in every religion, for they are the primeval Seven Rays.
          Humanity, Occultism teaches us, is divided into seven distinct
          Groups, with their sub-divisions, mental, spiritual, and physical.
          Hence there are seven chief planets, the spheres of the indwelling
          seven Spirits, under each of which is born one of the human Groups
          which is guided and influenced thereby. There are only seven
          planets <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">specially</span></em> connected with Earth,
          and twelve houses, but the possible combinations of their aspects
          are countless. As each planet can stand to each of the others in
          twelve different aspects, their combinations must be almost
          infinite; as infinite, in fact, as the spiritual, psychic, mental,
          and physical <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page627">[pg
          627]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg627"></a>
          capacities in the numberless varieties of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">genus

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is then the
          Seven Sons of Light,—called after their planets and often
          identified with them by the rabble, namely, Saturn, Jupiter,
          Mercury, Mars, Venus, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presumably</span></em> the Sun and Moon, for
          the modern critic, who goes no deeper than the surface of old

          as already remarked, Polytheism is really more philosophical and
          correct, as to fact and Nature, than is anthropomorphic Monotheism.
          Saturn, Jupiter, Mercury, and Venus, the four exoteric planets, and
          the three others, which must remain unnamed, were the heavenly
          bodies in direct astral and psychic communication, morally and
          physically, with the Earth, its Guides, and Watchers; the visible
          orbs furnishing our Humanity with its outward and inward
          characteristics, and their Regents or Rectors with our <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page629">[pg 629]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg629"></a> Monads and spiritual faculties. In
          order to avoid creating new misconceptions, let it be stated that
          among the three Secret Orbs, or Star-Angels, neither Uranus nor
          Neptune were included; not only because they were unknown under
          these names to the ancient Sages, but because they, like all other
          planets, however many there may be, are the Gods and Guardians of
          other septenary Chains of Globes within our System.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor do the two
          great planets last discovered depend entirely on the Sun, as do the
          rest of the planets. Otherwise, how can we explain the fact that
          Uranus receives 1/390th part of the light received by our Earth,
          while Neptune receives only 1/900th part; and that their satellites
          show a peculiarity of inverse rotation found in no other planets of
          the Solar System? At any rate, what we say applies to Uranus,
          though the fact has again been disputed recently.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This subject
          will, of course, be considered as a mere vagary, by all those who
          confuse the universal order of Being with their own systems of
          classification. Here, however, simple facts from Occult Teachings
          are stated, to be either accepted or rejected, as the case may be.
          There are details which, on account of their great metaphysical
          abstraction, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> be entered upon. Hence, we
          merely state that only seven of our planets are as intimately
          related to our Globe, as the Sun is to all the bodies subject to
          him in his System. Of these bodies the poor little number of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">primary</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secondary</span></em> planets known to
          Astronomy, looks wretched enough, in truth.<a href="#note_981" id="noteref_981" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">981</span></span></a>
          Therefore, it stands to reason that there are a great number of
          planets, small and large, that have not been discovered yet, but of
          the existence of which ancient Astronomers—all of them initiated
          Adepts—must certainly have been aware. But, as the relation of
          these to the Gods was sacred, it had to remain arcane, as did also
          the names of various other planets and stars.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides this,
          even the Roman Catholic Theology speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventy</span></em> planets that preside over
          the destinies of the nations of this globe;”</span> and, save the
          erroneous application, there is more truth in this tradition than
          in exact modern Astronomy. The seventy planets are connected
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page630">[pg 630]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg630"></a> with the seventy
          elders of the people of Israel,<a href="#note_982" id="noteref_982" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">982</span></span></a> and
          the Regents of these planets are meant, not the orbs themselves;
          the word seventy is a play and a blind upon the 7 × 7 of the
          subdivisions. Each people and nation, as we have already said, has
          its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">direct</span></em> Watcher, Guardian and
          Father in Heaven—a Planetary Spirit. We are willing to leave their
          own national God, Jehovah, to the descendants of Israel, the
          worshippers of Sabaoth or Saturn; for, indeed, the Monads of the
          people chosen by him are his own, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
          has never made any secret of it. Only the text of the Protestant
          English <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> is, as usual, in
          disagreement with those of the Septuagint and the Vulgate. Thus,
          while in the former we read:</p>

          the Gnostics. On its way to the Earth, as on its way back from the

          to pass through the seven planetary regions either way. The pure
          Dhyâni and Devas of the oldest religions had become, in course of
          time, with the Zoroastrians, the Seven Devs, the ministers of
          Ahriman, <span class="tei tei-q">“each chained to his

          the Brâhmans, the Asuras and some of the Rishis—good, bad and
          indifferent; among the Egyptian Gnostics it was Thoth, or Hermes,
          who was the chief of the Seven <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page631">[pg 631]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg631"></a> whose names are given by Origen as Adonai,
          genius of the Sun; Tao, of the Moon; Eloi, of Jupiter; Sabaoth, of
          Mars; Orai, of Venus; Astaphai, of Mercury; and Ildabaoth
          (Jehovah), of Saturn. Finally, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pistis-Sophia</span></span>, which the
          greatest modern authority on exoteric Gnostic beliefs, the late Mr.
          C. W. King, refers to as <span class="tei tei-q">“that precious
          monument of Gnosticism”</span>—this old document echoes the archaic
          belief of the ages, while distorting it to suit sectarian purposes.
          The Astral Rulers of the Spheres, the planets, create the Monads,
          or Souls, from their own substance out of <span class="tei tei-q">“the tears of their eyes, and the sweat of their
          torments,”</span> endowing the Monads with a spark of their
          substance which is the Divine Light. It will be shown in Volume II
          why these <span class="tei tei-q">“Lords of the Zodiac and
          Spheres”</span> have been transformed by sectarian Theology into
          the Rebellious Angels of the Christians, who took them from the
          Seven Devs of the Magi, without understanding the significance of
          the allegory.<a href="#note_987" id="noteref_987" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">987</span></span></a></p>

          distorted prism of man's conceptions—human and impure, as
          reflecting man's own sinful nature. Thus, in time, the planet
          Saturn became reviled by the worshippers of other Gods. The nations

          Jehovah, after being considered as a son of Saturn, or Ilda-Baoth,
          by the Ophites, and in the Book of Jasher—were eternally fighting

          contradictory theories of recent origin. The whole foundation
          belongs to Grecian and Indian Archaic Astronomy and Physics, in
          those days called always Philosophy. In all the Âryan and Greek
          speculations, we meet with the conception of an all-pervading,

          Scientists <span class="tei tei-q">“nebular condition of the

          <span class="tei tei-q">“primitive fluid”</span> by Sir William
          Thomson. The Hindû and Greek Atomists—Kanâda, Leucippus,
          Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius, etc.—are now reflected, as in a
          clear mirror, in the supporters of the Atomic Theory of our modern

          the corpuscular theory of old is rejected, and the undulatory

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we have to
          repeat that which was already said in Section VIII, that there is
          but one science that can henceforth direct modern research into the
          one path which will lead to the discovery of the whole, hitherto
          Occult, truth, and it is the youngest of all—Chemistry, as it now
          stands reformed. There is no other, not excluding Astronomy, that
          can so unerringly guide scientific intuition, as can Chemistry. Two
          proofs of this are to be found in the world of Science—two great
          Chemists, each among the greatest in his own country, namely, Mr.
          Crookes and the late Professor Butlerof: the one is a thorough
          believer in abnormal phenomena; the other was as fervid a
          Spiritualist, as he was great in the natural sciences. It becomes
          evident that, while pondering over the ultimate divisibility of
          Matter, and in the hitherto fruitless chase after the element of
          negative atomic weight, the scientifically trained mind of the
          Chemist must feel irresistibly drawn towards those ever-shrouded

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Let us start at the moment when the first element
          came into existence. Before this time, matter, as we know it, was
          not. It is equally impossible to conceive of matter without energy,
          as of energy without matter; from one point of view both are
          convertible terms. Before the birth of atoms, all those forms of
          energy, which become evident when matter acts upon matter, could
          not have existed</span><a href="#note_1000" id="noteref_1000" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1000</span></span></a><span style="font-size: 90%">—they
            were locked up in the protyle as latent potentialities only.
            Coincident with the creation of atoms, all those attributes and
            properties, which form the means of discriminating one chemical
            element from another, start into existence fully endowed with

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With every
          respect due to the great knowledge of the lecturer, the Occultist
          would put it otherwise. He would say that no Atom is ever
          <span class="tei tei-q">“created,”</span> for the Atoms are eternal
          within the bosom of the One Atom—<span class="tei tei-q">“the Atom
          of Atoms”</span>—viewed during Manvantara as the Jagad-Yoni, the
          material causative womb of the World. Pradhâna, unmodified
          Matter—that which is the first form of Prakriti, or material,
          visible, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page637">[pg
          637]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg637"></a>
          as well as invisible Nature—and Purusha, Spirit, are eternally one;
          and they are Nirupâdhi, without adventitious qualities or
          attributes, only during Pralaya, and when beyond any of the planes
          of consciousness of existence. The Atom, as known to modern
          science, is inseparable from Purusha, which is Spirit, but is now
          called <span class="tei tei-q">“energy”</span> in Science. The
          Protyle Atom has not been comminuted or subtilized: it has simply
          passed into that plane, which is no plane, but the eternal state of
          everything beyond the planes of illusion. Both Purusha and Pradhâna
          are immutable and unconsumable, or Aparinâmin and Avyaya, in
          eternity; and both may be referred to during the Mâyâvic periods as
          Vyaya and Parinâmin, or that which can expand, pass away and
          disappear, and which is <span class="tei tei-q">“modifiable.”</span> In this sense Purusha, must, of
          course, be held distinct in our conceptions from Parabrahman.
          Nevertheless that, which is called <span class="tei tei-q">“energy”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“force”</span> in Science, and which has been explained
          as a dual force by Metcalfe, is never, in fact, and cannot be,
          energy alone; for it is the Substance of the World, its Soul, the
          All-permeant, Sarvaga, in conjunction with Kâla, Time. The three
          are the trinity in one, during Manvantara, the all-potential Unity,
          which acts as three distinct things on Mâyâ, the plane of illusion.
          In the Orphic philosophy of ancient Greece they were called Phanes,
          Chaos, and Chronos—the triad of the Occult Philosophers of that

          Anaxagoras and the Chaldees in its discoveries of (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the
          origin of our phenomenal world, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) the
          modes of formation of the bodies that compose the Universe. And
          having, for their cosmogonical hypotheses to turn back to the
          beliefs of the earliest philosophers, and the systems of the
          latter—systems that were all based on the teachings of a universal
          Secret Doctrine with regard to primeval Matter, with its
          properties, functions, and laws—have we not the right to hope that
          the day is not far off when Science will show a better appreciation
          of the Wisdom of the Ancients than it has hitherto done?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No doubt Occult
          Philosophy could learn a good deal from exact Modern Science; but
          the latter, on the other hand, might profit by ancient learning in
          more than one way, and chiefly in Cosmogony. It might learn, for
          instance, the mystical signification, alchemical and
          transcendental, of the many <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imponderable</span></em> substances that fill
          interplanetary space, and which, interpenetrating each, are the
          direct cause, at the lower end, of the production of natural
          phenomena manifesting through so-called vibration. The knowledge of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>, not the hypothetical, nature
          of Ether, or rather of the Âkâsha, and other mysteries, in short,
          can alone lead to the knowledge of Forces. It is that Substance
          against which the Materialistic school of the Physicists rebels
          with such fury, especially in France,<a href="#note_1011" id="noteref_1011" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1011</span></span></a> and
          which exact Science has to advocate notwithstanding. They cannot
          make away with it without incurring the risk of pulling down the
          pillars of the Temple of Science, like a modern Samson, and of
          getting buried under its roof.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theories
          built upon the rejection of Force, outside and independent of
          Matter pure and simple, have all been shown to be fallacious. They
          do not, and cannot, cover the ground, and many of the scientific
          data are thus proved to be unscientific. <span class="tei tei-q">“Ether produced Sound”</span> is said in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span>, and the statement is
          laughed at. Sound is the result of the vibrations of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">air</span></em>, we
          are corrected. And what is air? Could it exist if there were no
          etheric medium in Space to buoy up its molecules? The case stands
          simply thus. Materialism cannot admit <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page642">[pg 642]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg642"></a> the existence of anything outside Matter,
          because with the acceptance of an imponderable Force—the source and
          head of all the physical Forces—other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">intelligent</span></em> Forces would have to
          be virtually admitted, and that would lead Science very far. For it
          would have to accept as a sequel the presence in Man of a still
          more spiritual power—entirely independent, for once, of any kind of
          Matter about which Physicists know anything. Hence, apart from a
          hypothetical Ether of Space and gross physical bodies, the whole
          sidereal and unseen Space is, in the sight of Materialists, one
          boundless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">void</span></em> in Nature—blind,
          unintelligent, useless.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And now the next
          question is: What is that Cosmic Substance, and how far can one go
          in suspecting its nature or in wrenching from it its secrets, thus
          feeling justified in giving it a name? How far, especially, has
          Modern Science gone in the direction of those secrets, and what is
          it doing to solve them? The latest hobby of Science, the Nebular
          Theory, may afford us some answer to this question. Let us then
          examine the credentials of this Nebular Theory.</p>

<span style="font-size: 144%">Section XII. Scientific and Esoteric
          Evidence for, and Objections to, the Modern Nebular
          Theory.</span></h2>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of late,
          Esoteric Cosmogony has been frequently opposed by the phantom of
          this theory and its ensuing hypotheses. <span class="tei tei-q">“Can this most scientific teaching be denied by your
          Adepts?”</span> it is asked. <span class="tei tei-q">“Not
          entirely,”</span> is the reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“but the
          admissions of the men of Science themselves <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">kill</span></em>
          it; and there remains nothing for the Adepts to deny.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To make of
          Science an integral <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whole</span></em> necessitates, indeed, the
          study of spiritual and psychic, as well as of physical, Nature.
          Otherwise it will ever be like the anatomy of man, discussed of old
          by the profane from the point of view of his shell-side, and in
          ignorance of the interior work. Even Plato, the greatest
          Philosopher of his country, was guilty, before his Initiation, of
          such statements as that liquids pass into the stomach through the
          lungs. Without metaphysics, as Mr. H. J. Slack says, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em>
          Science is inadmissible.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The nebulæ
          exist; yet the Nebular Theory is wrong. A nebula exists in a state
          of entire elemental dissociation. It is gaseous and—something else
          besides, which can hardly be connected with gases as these are
          known to Physical Science; and it is self-luminous. But that is
          all. The sixty-two <span class="tei tei-q">“coincidences”</span>
          enumerated by Professor Stephen Alexander,<a href="#note_1012" id="noteref_1012" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1012</span></span></a>
          confirming the Nebular Theory, may all be explained by Esoteric
          Science; though, as this is not an astronomical work, the
          refutations are not attempted at present. Laplace and Faye come
          nearer to the correct theory than any; but of the speculations of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page644">[pg 644]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg644"></a> Laplace there
          remains little in the present theory beyond its general
          features.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          says John Stuart Mill:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">There is in Laplace's theory nothing hypothetical;
          it is an example of legitimate reasoning from present effect to its
          past cause; it assumes nothing more than that objects which really
          exist obey the laws which are known to be obeyed by all terrestrial
          objects resembling them.</span><a href="#note_1013" id="noteref_1013" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1013</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From such an
          eminent logician as was Mill, this would be valuable, if it could
          only be proved that <span class="tei tei-q">“terrestrial objects
          resembling”</span> celestial objects at such a distance as are the
          nebulæ, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">resemble those objects in reality, and not
          only in appearance</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another of the
          fallacies, from the Occult standpoint, embodied in the modern
          theory as it now stands, is the hypothesis that the Planets were
          all detached from the Sun; that they are bone of his bone, and
          flesh of his flesh; whereas the Sun and the Planets are only
          co-uterine brothers, having the same nebular origin, but in a
          different mode from that postulated by modern Astronomy.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The many
          objections raised by some opponents of the modern Nebular Theory
          against the homogeneity of original diffuse Matter, on the ground
          of the uniformity in the composition of the fixed Stars, do not
          affect the question of that homogeneity at all, but only the theory
          itself. Our solar nebula may not be completely homogeneous, or,
          rather, it may fail to reveal itself as such to the Astronomers,
          and yet be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">de facto</span></span> homogeneous. The Stars
          do differ in their constituent materials, and even exhibit elements
          quite unknown on Earth; nevertheless, this does not affect the
          point that Primeval Matter—Matter as it appeared even in its first
          differentiation from its laya-condition<a href="#note_1014" id="noteref_1014" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1014</span></span></a>—is
          yet to this day homogeneous, at immense distances, in the depths of
          infinitude, and likewise at points not far removed from the
          outskirts of our Solar System.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finally, there
          does not exist one single fact brought forward by the learned
          objectors against the Nebular Theory (false as it is, and hence,
          illogically enough, fatal to the hypothesis of the homogeneity of
          Matter), that can withstand criticism. One error leads to another.
          A false premiss will naturally lead to a false conclusion, although
          an inadmissible inference does not necessarily affect the validity
          of the major proposition of the syllogism. Thus, one may leave
          every side-issue and inference from the evidence of spectra and
          lines, as simply <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page645">[pg
          645]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg645"></a>
          provisional for the present, and abandon all matters of detail to
          Physical Science. The duty of the Occultist lies with the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Soul</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Spirit</span></em>
          of Cosmic Space, not merely with its illusive appearance and
          behaviour. That of official Physical Science is to analyze and
          study its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shell</span></em>—the Ultima Thule of the
          Universe and Man, in the opinion of Materialism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the latter,
          Occultism has nought to do. It is only with the theories of such
          men of learning as Kepler, Kant, Oersted, and Sir William
          Herschell, who believed in a Spiritual World, that Occult Cosmogony
          might treat, and attempt a satisfactory compromise. But the views
          of those Physicists differed vastly from the latest modern
          speculations. Kant and Herschell had in their mind's eye
          speculations upon the origin and the final destiny, as well as upon
          the present aspect, of the Universe, from a far more philosophical
          and psychic standpoint; whereas modern Cosmology and Astronomy now
          repudiate anything like research into the mysteries of Being. The
          result is what might be expected: complete failure and inextricable
          contradictions in the thousand and one varieties of so-called
          Scientific Theories, and in this Theory as in all others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The nebular
          hypothesis, involving the theory of the existence of a Primeval
          Matter, diffused in a nebulous condition, is of no modern date in
          Astronomy, as everyone knows. Anaximenes, of the Ionian school, had
          already taught that the sidereal bodies were formed through the
          progressive condensation of a primordial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pregenetic</span></em> Matter, which had
          almost a negative weight, and was spread out through Space in an
          extremely sublimated condition.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tycho Brahé, who
          viewed the Milky Way as an ethereal substance, thought the new star
          that appeared in Cassiopeia, in 1572, had been formed out of that
          Matter.<a href="#note_1015" id="noteref_1015" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1015</span></span></a>
          Kepler believed that the star of 1606 had likewise been formed out
          of the ethereal substance that fills the universe.<a href="#note_1016" id="noteref_1016" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a> He
          attributed to that same Ether the apparition of a luminous ring
          round the Moon, during the total eclipse of the Sun observed at
          Naples in 1605.<a href="#note_1017" id="noteref_1017" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1017</span></span></a>
          Still later, in 1714 the existence of a self-luminous Matter was
          recognized by Halley in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Philosophical Transactions</span></span>.
          Finally, the journal of this name published in 1811 the famous
          hypothesis of the eminent Astronomer, Sir William Herschell,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page646">[pg 646]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg646"></a> on the
          transformation of the nebulæ into Stars,<a href="#note_1018" id="noteref_1018" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1018</span></span></a> and
          after this the Nebular Theory was accepted by the Royal
          Academies.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Five Years of
          Theosophy</span></span>, on p. 245, may be read an article headed,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Do the Adepts deny the Nebular
          Theory?”</span> The answer there given is:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No; they do not deny
          its general propositions, nor the approximative truth of the
          scientific hypotheses. They only deny the completeness of the
          present, as well as the entire error of the many so-called</span>
<span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-style: italic">“</span><span style="font-style: italic">exploded</span><span style="font-style: italic">”</span></span> <span style="font-style: italic">old theories, which, during the last century,
          have followed each other in such rapid
          succession.</span></span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was
          asserted at the time to be <span class="tei tei-q">“an evasive
          answer.”</span> Such disrespect to official Science, it was argued,
          must be justified by the replacement of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">orthodox</span></em> speculation by another
          theory more complete, and having a firmer ground to stand upon. To
          this there is but one reply: It is useless to give out isolated
          theories with regard to things embodied in a complete and
          consecutive system, for, when separated from the main body of the
          teaching, they would necessarily lose their vital coherence and
          would thus do no good when studied independently. To be able to
          appreciate and accept the Occult views on the Nebular Theory, we
          must study the whole Esoteric cosmogonical system. And the time has
          hardly arrived for the Astronomers to be asked to accept Fohat and
          the Divine Builders. Even the undeniably correct surmises of Sir
          William Herschell, which had nothing <span class="tei tei-q">“supernatural”</span> in them, as to the Sun's being
          called a <span class="tei tei-q">“globe of fire,”</span> perhaps
          metaphorically, and his early speculations about the nature of that
          which is now called the Nasmyth Willow-leaf Theory, only caused
          that most eminent of all Astronomers to be smiled at by other, far
          less eminent, colleagues, who saw and now see in his ideas purely
          <span class="tei tei-q">“imaginative and fanciful theories.”</span>
          Before the whole Esoteric System could be given out and appreciated
          by the Astronomers, the latter would have to return to some of
          those <span class="tei tei-q">“antiquated ideas,”</span> not only
          to those of Herschell, but also to the dreams of the oldest Hindû
          Astronomers, and thus abandon their own theories, which are none
          the less <span class="tei tei-q">“fanciful”</span> because they
          have appeared nearly eighty years later than the one, and many
          thousands of years later than the others. Foremost of all they
          would have to repudiate their ideas of the Sun's solidity and
          incandescence; the Sun <span class="tei tei-q">“glowing”</span>
          most undeniably, but not <span class="tei tei-q">“burning.”</span>
          Then the Occultists state, with regard to the <span class="tei tei-q">“willow-leaves,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page647">[pg 647]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg647"></a> that those <span class="tei tei-q">“objects,”</span> as Sir William Herschell called them,
          are the immediate sources of the solar light and heat. And though
          the Esoteric Teaching does not regard these as he did—namely, as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“organisms”</span> partaking of the nature
          of life, for the Solar <span class="tei tei-q">“Beings”</span> will
          hardly place themselves within telescopic focus—yet it asserts that
          the whole Universe is full of such <span class="tei tei-q">“organisms,”</span> conscious and active according to
          the proximity or distance of their planes to, or from, our plane of
          consciousness; and finally that the great Astronomer was right
          while speculating on those supposed <span class="tei tei-q">“organisms,”</span> in saying that <span class="tei tei-q">“we do not know that vital action is incompetent to
          develop at once heat, light, and electricity.”</span> For, at the
          risk of being laughed at by the whole world of Physicists, the
          Occultists maintain that all the <span class="tei tei-q">“Forces”</span> of the Scientists have their origin in
          the Vital Principle, the One Life collectively of our Solar
          System—that <span class="tei tei-q">“Life”</span> being a portion,
          or rather one of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aspects</span></em>, of the One Universal
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Life</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may,
          therefore—as in the article under consideration, wherein, on the
          authority of the Adepts, it was maintained that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“sufficient to make a <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">résumé</span></span> of what the solar
          Physicists do not know”</span>—we may, we maintain, define our
          position with regard to the modern Nebular Theory and its evident
          incorrectness, by simply pointing out facts diametrically opposed
          to it in its present form. And to begin with, what does it
          teach?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Summarizing the
          aforesaid hypotheses, it becomes plain that Laplace's theory—now
          made quite unrecognizable, moreover—was an unfortunate one. He
          postulates in the first place Cosmic Matter, existing in a state of
          diffuse nebulosity <span class="tei tei-q">“so fine that its

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Consequently,
          whether one accepts or rejects his theory in its bearing upon the

          sketch of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">probable</span></em> broad principles on which
          the actual process is assumed to be based. Well, and what is this
          now celebrated note on the said process? <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page648">[pg 648]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg648"></a> What has he given so wonderfully new and
          original, that its ground-work, at any rate, should have served as
          a basis for the modern Nebular Theory? The following is what one
          gathers from various astronomical works.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Laplace thought
          that, in consequence of the condensation of the atoms of the
          primeval nebula, according to the <span class="tei tei-q">“law”</span> of gravity, the now gaseous, or perhaps,
          partially liquid mass, acquired a rotatory motion. As the velocity
          of this rotation increased, it assumed the form of a thin disc;
          finally, the centrifugal force overpowering that of cohesion, huge
          rings were detached from the edge of the whirling incandescent
          masses, and these rings contracted necessarily by gravitation (as
          accepted) into spheroidal bodies, which would necessarily still
          continue to preserve the orbit previously occupied by the outer
          zone from which they were separated.<a href="#note_1019" id="noteref_1019" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1019</span></span></a> The
          velocity of the outer edge of each nascent planet, he said,
          exceeding that of the inner, there results a rotation on its axis.
          The more dense bodies would be thrown off last; and finally, during
          the preliminary state of their formation, the newly-segregated orbs
          in their turn throw off one or more satellites. In formulating the
          history of the rupture and planetation of rings Laplace says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Almost always each ring of vapours must have
          broken up into numerous masses, which, moving with a nearly uniform
          velocity, must have continued to circulate at the same distance
          around the sun. These masses must have taken a spheroidal form with
          a motion of rotation in the same direction as their revolution,
          since the inner molecules (those nearest the sun) would have less
          actual velocity than the exterior ones. They must then have formed
          as many planets in a state of vapour. But, if one of them was
          sufficiently powerful to unite successively, by its attraction, all
          the others around its centre, the ring of vapours must have been
          thus transformed into a single spheroidal mass of vapours
          circulating around the sun with a rotation in the same direction as
          its revolution. The latter case has been the more common, but the
          solar system presents us the first case, in the four small planets
          which move between Jupiter and Mars.</span></p>

          insurmountable difficulties with which it is attended. Why, for

          distant Uranus denser than Saturn? How is it that there are so many
          variations in the inclination of their axes and orbits in the
          supposed progeny of the central orb; that such startling variations
          in the size of the Planets are noticeable; that the satellites of
          Jupiter are more dense by ·288 than their primary; that the
          phenomena of meteoric and cometary systems still remain unaccounted
          for? To quote the words of a Master:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></span>
          [the Adepts] <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">find that the centrifugal theory of Western

          neither account for every oblate spheroid, nor explain away such

          centripetal force to contend with, should have its polar
          compression only three times greater than Mercury's? To crown the
          above contradictions, we are asked to believe in the Central
          Forces, as taught by Modern Science, even when told that the
          equatorial matter of the Sun, with more than four times the
          centrifugal velocity of the Earth's equatorial surface, and only
          about one-fourth part of the gravitation of the equatorial matter,
          has not manifested any tendency to bulge at the solar equator, nor
          shown the least flattening at the poles of the solar axis. In other
          and clearer words, the Sun, with only one-fourth of our Earth's
          density for the centrifugal force to work upon, has no polar
          compression at all! We find this objection made by more than one

          Occultism does not deny the certainty of the mechanical origin of
          the Universe; it only claims the absolute necessity of mechanicians
          of some sort behind or within those Elements—a dogma with us. It is
          not the fortuitous assistance of the Atoms of Lucretius, as he
          himself knew well, that built the Kosmos and all in it. Nature
          herself contradicts such a theory. Celestial Space, containing
          Matter so attenuated as Ether, cannot be called on, with or without
          attraction, to explain the common motion of the sidereal hosts.
          Although the perfect accord of their inter-revolution indicates
          clearly the presence of a mechanical cause in Nature, Newton, who
          of all men had most right to trust to his deductions, was
          nevertheless forced to abandon the idea of ever explaining the
          original impulse given to the millions of orbs, by merely the laws
          of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known</span></em> Nature and its material
          Forces. He recognized fully the limits that separate the action of
          natural Forces from that of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Intelligences</span></em> that set the
          immutable laws in order and action. And if a Newton had to renounce
          such hope, which of the modern materialistic pigmies has the right
          of saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“I know better?”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cosmogonical
          theory, to become complete and comprehensible, has to start with a
          Primordial Substance diffused throughout boundless Space,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of an
          intellectual and divine nature</span></em>. That Substance must be
          the Soul and Spirit, the Synthesis and Seventh Principle of the
          manifested Kosmos, and, to serve as a spiritual Upâdhi to this,
          there must be the sixth, its vehicle—Primordial Physical Matter, so
          to speak, though its nature must escape for ever our limited
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">normal</span></em> senses. It is easy for an
          Astronomer, if endowed with an imaginative faculty, to build a
          theory of the emergence of the Universe out of Chaos, by simply
          applying to it the principles of mechanics. But such a Universe
          will always prove a Frankenstein's monster with respect to its
          scientific human creator; it will lead him into endless
          perplexities. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page651">[pg

          The application of mechanical laws only can never carry the
          speculator beyond the objective world; nor will it unveil to men
          the origin and final destiny of Kosmos. This is whither the Nebular
          Theory has led Science. In sober fact and truth this Theory is twin
          sister to that of Ether, and both are the offspring of necessity;
          one is as indispensable to account for the transmission of light,
          as is the other to explain the problem of the origin of the Solar
          Systems. The question with Science is, how the same homogeneous
          Matter<a href="#note_1021" id="noteref_1021" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1021</span></span></a>
          could, obeying the laws of Newton, give birth to bodies—Sun,
          Planets, and their satellites—subject to conditions of identity of
          motion, and formed of such heterogeneous elements.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Has the Nebular
          Theory helped to solve the problem, even if applied solely to
          bodies considered as inanimate and material? We say: most decidedly
          not. What progress has it made since 1811, when first Sir William
          Herschell's paper, with its facts based on observation and showing
          the existence of nebular matter, made the sons of the Royal Society
          <span class="tei tei-q">“shout for joy”</span>? Since then a still
          greater discovery, through spectrum analysis, has permitted the
          verification and corroboration of Sir William Herschell's
          conjecture. Laplace demanded some kind of primitive <span class="tei tei-q">“world-stuff”</span> to prove the idea of progressive
          world-evolution and growth. Here it is, as offered two millenniums
          ago.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class="tei tei-q">“world-stuff,”</span> now called nebulæ, was known from
          the highest antiquity. Anaxagoras taught that, upon
          differentiation, the resulting commixture of heterogeneous
          substances remained motionless and unorganized, until finally the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind”</span>—the collective body of Dhyân
          Chohans, we say—began to work upon, and communicated to, them
          motion and order.<a href="#note_1022" id="noteref_1022" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> This
          theory is now taken up, so far as concerns its first portion; the
          last, that of any <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind”</span>
          interfering, being rejected. Spectrum analysis reveals the
          existence of nebulæ formed entirely of gases and luminous vapours.
          Is this the primitive nebular Matter? The spectra reveal, it is
          said, the physical conditions of the Matter which emits cosmic
          light. The spectra of the resolvable and the irresolvable nebulæ
          are shown to be entirely different, the spectra of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page652">[pg 652]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg652"></a> latter showing their physical state to
          be that of glowing gas or vapour. The bright lines of one nebula
          reveal the existence of hydrogen, and of other material substances
          known and unknown. The same as to the atmospheres of the Sun and
          Stars. This leads to the direct inference that a Star is formed by
          the condensation of a nebula; hence that even the metals themselves
          are formed on earth by the condensation of hydrogen or of some
          other primitive matter, some ancestral cousin to helium, perhaps,
          or some yet unknown stuff. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This does not clash with the Occult
          Teachings.</span></span> And this is the problem that Chemistry is
          trying to solve; and it must succeed sooner or later in the task,
          accepting <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">nolens volens</span></span>, when it does, the
          Esoteric Teaching. But when this does happen, it will kill the
          Nebular Theory as it now stands.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Meanwhile
          Astronomy cannot accept in any way, if it is to be regarded as an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exact</span></em> Science, the present theory
          of the filiation of Stars—even if Occultism does so in its own way,
          seeing that it explains this filiation differently—because
          Astronomy has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one single physical datum</span></em> to
          show for it. Astronomy could anticipate Chemistry in proving the
          existence of the fact, if it could show a planetary nebula
          exhibiting a spectrum of three or four bright lines, gradually
          condensing and transforming into a Star, with a spectrum all

          lines disappeared, leaving finally one single brilliant line, which
          appeared to coincide with the green line of the nebula.</p>

          The occurrence may have been due to several other causes. Since
          Astronomers are inclined to think our Planets are tending toward
          precipitation into the Sun, why should not that Star have blazed up
          owing to a collision of such precipitated Planets, or, as many
          suggest, the appulse of a Comet? Be that as it may, the only known
          instance of star-transformation since 1811 is not favourable to the
          Nebular Theory. Moreover, on the question of this Theory, as on all
          others, Astronomers disagree.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our own age,
          and before Laplace ever thought of it, Buffon, being very much
          struck by the identity of motion in the Planets, was the first to
          propose the hypothesis that the Planets and their satellites
          originated in the bosom of the Sun. Forthwith and for this purpose,
          he invented a special Comet, supposed to have torn out, by a
          powerful oblique blow, the quantity of matter necessary for their
          formation. Laplace gave its dues to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Comet”</span> in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exposition du Système
          du Monde</span></span>.<a href="#note_1025" id="noteref_1025" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1025</span></span></a> But
          the idea was seized and even improved upon by a conception of the
          alternate evolution, from the Sun's central mass, of Planets
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">apparently</span></em> without weight or
          influence on the motion of the visible Planets—and as evidently
          without any more existence than the likeness of Moses in the
          Moon.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the modern
          theory is also a variation on the systems elaborated by Kant and
          Laplace. The idea of both was that, at the origin of things, all
          that Matter which now enters into the composition of the planetary
          bodies was spread over all the space comprized in the Solar
          System—and even beyond. It was a nebula of extremely small density,
          and its condensation gradually gave birth, by a mechanism that has
          hitherto never been explained, to the various bodies of our System.
          This is the original Nebular Theory, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">incomplete</span></em> yet faithful
          repetition—a short chapter out of the large volume of universal
          Esoteric Cosmogony—of the teachings of the Secret Doctrine. And
          both systems, Kant's and Laplace's, differ greatly from the modern
          Theory, redundant with conflicting <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sub</span></em>-theories and fanciful

          resolving into stars with an instrument of sufficient power. This

          physical state of the constituent matter of the stars, but affords
          us no notions of their modes of aggregation. A nebula formed of
          gaseous globes (or even of nuclei, faintly luminous, surrounded by
          a powerful atmosphere) would give a spectrum of lines and be still
          resolvable; such seems to be the state of Huggins' region in the
          Orion nebula. A nebula formed of solid or fluidic particles in a

          primitive chaos which has produced the totality of the heavenly
          bodies, we have first to account for the actual existence of these

          to us in certain nebulæ by the spectroscope. If the original chaos
          was composed of such particles, how did certain of their portions

          when there will remain no other issue—as in the case of Ether.
          Modern Science is secure only in its own domain and region; within
          the physical boundaries of our Solar System, beyond which
          everything, every particle of Matter, is different from the Matter

          Centre—reänimated by the combustible matter of the Planets. In this
          theory, generated and developed in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page659">[pg 659]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg659"></a> brain of a young man hardly twenty-five years
          of age, who had never left his native place, Königsberg, a small
          town of Northern Prussia, one can hardly fail to recognize either
          the presence of an inspiring external power, or an evidence of the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reïncarnation</span></em> which the Occultists
          see in it. It fills a gap which Newton, with all his genius, failed
          to bridge. And surely it is our Primeval Matter, Âkâsha, that Kant
          had in view, when he postulated a universally pervading primordial
          Substance, in order to solve Newton's difficulty, and his failure
          to explain, by natural forces alone, the primitive impulse imparted
          to the Planets. For, as he remarks in Chapter viii, if it is once
          admitted that the perfect harmony of the Stars and Planets and the
          coincidence of their orbital planes prove the existence of a
          natural Cause, which would thus be the Primal Cause, <span class="tei tei-q">“that Cause cannot really be the matter which fills
          to-day the heavenly spaces.”</span> It must be that which filled
          Space—was Space—originally, whose motion in differentiated Matter
          was the origin of the actual movements of the sidereal bodies; and
          which, <span class="tei tei-q">“in condensing itself in those very
          bodies, thus abandoned the space that is to-day found void.”</span>
          In other words, it is of that same Matter that are now composed the
          Planets, Comets, and the Sun himself, and that Matter, having
          originally formed itself into those bodies, has preserved its
          inherent quality of motion; which quality, now centred in their
          nuclei, directs all motion. A very slight alteration of words in
          this is needed, and a few additions, to make of it our Esoteric
          Doctrine.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The latter
          teaches that it is this original, primordial Prima Materia, divine
          and intelligent, the direct emanation of the Universal Mind, the
          Daiviprakriti—the Divine Light<a href="#note_1036" id="noteref_1036" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1036</span></span></a>
          emanating from the Logos—which formed the nuclei of all the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“self-moving”</span> orbs in Kosmos. It is
          the informing, ever-present moving-power and life-principle, the
          Vital Soul of the Suns, Moons, Planets, and even of our Earth; the
          former latent, the latter active—the invisible Ruler and Guide of
          the gross body attached to, and connected with, its Soul, which is
          the spiritual emanation, after all, of these respective Planetary
          Spirits.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another quite
          Occult Doctrine is the theory of Kant, that the Matter of which the
          inhabitants and the animals of other Planets are formed is of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a lighter
          and more subtle nature and of a more perfect conformation, in
          proportion to their distance from the Sun</span></span>. The latter
          is too full of Vital Electricity, of the physical, life-giving
          principle. Therefore, the men <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page660">[pg 660]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg660"></a> on Mars are more ethereal than we are, while
          those on Venus are more gross, though far more intelligent, if less
          spiritual.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
          doctrine is not quite ours—yet these Kantian theories are as
          metaphysical, and as transcendental as any Occult Doctrines; and
          more than one man of Science would, if he but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dared</span></em>
          speak his mind, accept them as Wolf does. From this Kantian Mind
          and Soul of the Suns and Stars to the Mahat (Mind) and Prakriti of
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> there is but a step.
          After all, the admission of this by Science would be only the
          admission of a natural cause, whether it would or would not stretch
          its belief to such metaphysical heights. But then Mahat, the Mind,
          is a <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span> and Physiology admits
          <span class="tei tei-q">“mind”</span> only as a temporary function
          of the material brain, and no more.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Satan of
          Materialism now laughs at all alike, and denies the visible as well
          as the invisible. Seeing in light, heat, electricity, and even in
          the phenomenon of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">life</span></em>, only properties inherent in
          Matter, it laughs whenever life is called the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vital
          Principle</span></span>, and derides the idea of its being
          independent of and distinct from the organism.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But here again
          scientific opinions differ as in everything else, and there are
          several men of Science who accept views very similar to ours.
          Consider, for instance, what Dr. Richardson, F.R.S. (elsewhere
          quoted at length) says of that <span class="tei tei-q">“Vital
          Principle,”</span> which he calls <span class="tei tei-q">“Nervous
          Ether”</span>:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Biology and
          Physiology now deny, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in toto</span></span>, the existence of a
          Vital Principle, this extract, together with De Quatrefages'
          admission, is a clear confirmation that there are men of Science
          who take the same views about <span class="tei tei-q">“things
          Occult”</span> as do Theosophists and Occultists. These recognize a
          distinct Vital Principle independent of the organism—material,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page661">[pg 661]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg661"></a> of course,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
          physical Force cannot be divorced from Matter</span></em>, but of a
          Substance existing in a state unknown to Science. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Life for them is
          something more than the mere interaction of molecules and
          atoms.</span></span> There is a Vital Principle without which no
          molecular combinations could ever have resulted in a living
          organism, least of all in the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“inorganic”</span> Matter of our plane of
          consciousness.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By <span class="tei tei-q">“molecular combinations”</span> are meant, of course,
          those of the Matter of our present illusive perceptions, which
          Matter energizes only on this, our plane. And this is the chief
          point at issue.<a href="#note_1040" id="noteref_1040" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1040</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus the
          Occultists are not alone in their beliefs. Nor are they so foolish,
          after all, in rejecting even the <span class="tei tei-q">“gravity”</span> of Modern Science along with other
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">physical</span></em> laws, and in accepting
          instead <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">attraction</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">repulsion</span></em>. They see, moreover, in
          these two opposite Forces only the two <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">aspects</span></em>
          of the Universal Unit, called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Manifesting Mind</span></em>; in which
          aspects, Occultism, through its great Seers, perceives an
          innumerable Host of operative Beings: cosmic Dhyân Chohans,
          Entities, whose essence, in its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dual</span></em>
          nature, is the Cause of all terrestrial phenomena. For that essence
          is con-substantial with the universal Electric Ocean, which is
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Life</span></span>; and being dual, as
          said—positive and negative—it is the emanations of that duality
          that act now on Earth under the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of motion”</span>; even Force having now become
          objectionable as a word, for fear it should lead someone, even in
          thought, to separate it from Matter! It is, as Occultism says, the
          dual <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">effects</span></em> of that dual essence,
          which have now been called centripetal and centrifugal forces, now
          negative and positive poles, or polarity, heat and cold, light and
          darkness, etc.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And it is
          further maintained that even the Greek and Roman Catholic
          Christians are wiser in believing, as they do—even if blindly
          connecting and tracing them all to an anthropomorphic God—in
          Angels, Archangels, Archons, Seraphs, and Morning Stars, in all
          those theological <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">deliciæ humani generis</span></span>, in
          short, that rule the Cosmic Elements, than Science is, in
          disbelieving in them altogether, and in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page662">[pg 662]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg662"></a> advocating its mechanical Forces. For these
          act very often with more than human intelligence and pertinency.
          Nevertheless, that intelligence is denied and attributed to blind
          chance. But, as De Maistre was right in calling the law of
          gravitation merely a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word</span></em> which replaced <span class="tei tei-q">“the thing unknown,”</span> so are we right in applying
          the same remark to all the other Forces of Science. And if it is
          objected that the Count was an ardent Roman Catholic, then we may
          cite Le Couturier, as ardent a Materialist, who said the same
          thing, as did also Herschell and many others.<a href="#note_1041" id="noteref_1041" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Gods to
          men, from Worlds to atoms, from a Star to a rush-light, from the
          Sun to the vital heat of the meanest organic being—the world of
          Form and Existence is an immense chain, the links of which are all
          connected. The Law of Analogy is the first key to the
          world-problem, and these links have to be studied coördinately in
          their Occult relations to each other.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, therefore,
          the Secret Doctrine—postulating that conditioned or limited space
          (location) has no real being except in this world of illusion, or,
          in other words, in our perceptive faculties—teaches that every one
          of the higher, as of the lower worlds, is interblended with our own
          objective world; that millions of things and beings are, in point
          of localization, around and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em> us, as we are around, with, and
          in them; this is no mere metaphysical figure of speech, but a sober
          fact in Nature, however incomprehensible to our senses.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But one has to
          understand the phraseology of Occultism before criticizing what it
          asserts. For example, the Doctrine refuses—as Science does, in one
          sense—to use the words <span class="tei tei-q">“above”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“below,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“higher”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“lower,”</span> in reference to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invisible</span></em> spheres, since here they
          are without meaning. Even the terms <span class="tei tei-q">“East”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“West”</span>
          are merely conventional, necessary only to aid our human
          perceptions. For though the Earth has its two fixed points in the
          poles, North and South, yet both East and West are variable
          relatively to our own position on the Earth's surface, and in
          consequence of its rotation from West to East. Hence, when
          <span class="tei tei-q">“other worlds”</span> are mentioned—whether
          better or worse, more spiritual or still more material, though both
          invisible—the Occultist does not locate these spheres either
          outside or inside our Earth, as the theologians and the poets do;
          for their location is nowhere in the space known to, or conceived
          by, the profane. They are, as it were, blended with our
          world—interpenetrating <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page663">[pg
          663]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg663"></a>
          it and interpenetrated by it. There are millions and millions of
          worlds and firmaments visible to us; there are still greater
          numbers beyond those visible to the telescope, and many of the
          latter kind do not belong to our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> sphere of existence.
          Although as invisible as if they were millions of miles beyond our
          Solar System, they are yet with us, near us, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>
          our own world, as objective and material to their respective
          inhabitants as ours is to us. But, again, the relation of these
          worlds to ours is not that of a series of egg-shaped boxes enclosed
          one within the other, like the toys called Chinese nests; each is
          entirely under its own special laws and conditions, having no
          direct relation to our sphere. The inhabitants of these, as already
          said, may be, for all we know, or feel, passing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>
          and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">around</span></em> us as if through empty
          space, their very habitations and countries being interblended with
          ours, though not disturbing our vision, because we have not yet the
          faculties necessary for discerning them. Yet by their spiritual
          sight the Adepts, and even some seers and sensitives, are always
          able to discern, whether in a greater or smaller degree, the
          presence and close proximity to us of Beings pertaining to other
          spheres of life. Those of the spiritually higher worlds communicate
          only with those terrestrial mortals who ascend to them, through
          individual efforts, on to the higher plane they are occupying.</p>

          Society, while believing in it all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">secretly</span></em>, is made to deride the

          etherealizing until they become formless and are as <span class="tei tei-q">“breaths.”</span> The fact that our physical eye does
          not see them, is no reason for disbelieving in them. Physicists
          cannot see their Ether, Atoms, <span class="tei tei-q">“modes of
          motion,”</span> or Forces. Yet they accept and teach them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we find, even
          in the natural world with which we are acquainted, Matter affording
          a partial analogy to the difficult conception of such invisible
          worlds, there seems little difficulty in recognizing the
          possibility of such a presence. The tail of a Comet, which, though
          attracting our attention by virtue of its luminosity, yet does not
          disturb or impede our vision of objects, which we perceive through
          and beyond it, affords the first stepping-stone toward a proof of
          the same. The tail of a Comet passes rapidly across our horizon,
          and we should neither feel it, nor be cognizant of its passage, but
          for the brilliant coruscation, often perceived only by a few
          interested in the phenomenon, while everyone else remains ignorant
          of its presence and of its passage <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">through</span></em>, or across, a portion of
          our globe. This tail may, or may not, be an integral portion of the
          being of the Comet, but its tenuity subserves our purpose as an
          illustration. Indeed, it is no question of superstition, but simply
          a result of transcendental Science, and of logic still more, to
          admit the existence of worlds formed of even far more attenuated
          Matter than the tail of a Comet. By denying such a possibility,
          Science has for the last century played into the hands of neither
          Philosophy nor true Religion, but simply into those of Theology. To
          be able to dispute the better the plurality of even material
          worlds, a belief thought by many churchmen incompatible with the
          teachings and doctrines of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>,<a href="#note_1044" id="noteref_1044" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1044</span></span></a>
          Maxwell had to calumniate the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page665">[pg 665]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg665"></a> memory of Newton, and to try and convince his
          public that the principles contained in the Newtonian philosophy
          are those <span class="tei tei-q">“which lie at the foundation of
          all atheistical systems.”</span><a href="#note_1045" id="noteref_1045" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1045</span></span></a></p>

          within the apparently transparent space of our own!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, if we can
          conceive of a world composed of Matter still more attenuated to
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> senses than the tail of a
          Comet, hence of inhabitants in it who are as ethereal, in

          wonder if we do not perceive them, nor sense their presence or even
          existence. Only, in what is the idea contrary to Science? Cannot
          men and animals, plants and rocks, be supposed to be endowed with
          quite a different set of senses from those we possess? Cannot their
          organisms be born, develop, and exist, under other laws of being
          than those that rule our little world? Is it absolutely necessary
          that every corporeal being should be clothed in <span class="tei tei-q">“coats of skin”</span> like those that Adam and Eve
          were provided with in the legend of Genesis? Corporeality, we are
          told, however, by more than one man of Science, <span class="tei tei-q">“may exist under very divergent conditions.”</span>
          Professor A. Winchell—arguing upon the plurality of worlds—makes
          the following remarks:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It is not at all improbable that substances of a
          refractory nature might be so mixed with other substances, known or
          unknown to us, as to be capable of enduring vastly greater
          vicissitudes of heat and cold than is possible with terrestrial
          organisms. The tissues of terrestrial animals are simply suited to
          terrestrial conditions. Yet even here we find different types and
          species of animals adapted to the trials of extremely dissimilar
          situations.... That an animal should be a quadruped or a biped is
          something not depending on the necessities of organization, or
          instinct, or intelligence. That an animal should possess just five
          senses is not a necessity of percipient existence. There may be
          animals on the earth with neither smell nor taste. There may be
          beings on other worlds, and even on this, who possess more numerous
          senses than we. The possibility of this is apparent when we
          consider the high probability that other properties and other modes
          of existence lie among the resources of the Cosmos, and even of
          terrestrial matter. There are animals which subsist where rational
          man would perish—in the soil, in</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page666">[pg 666]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg666"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">the river, and
            the sea ... [and why not</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">human</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">beings of different organizations,
            in such case?].... Nor is incorporated rational existence
            conditioned on warm blood, nor on any temperature which does not
            change the forms of matter of which the organism may be composed.
            There may be intelligences corporealized after some concept not
            involving the processes of injection, assimilation, and
            reproduction. Such bodies would not require daily food and
            warmth. They might be lost in the abysses of the ocean, or laid
            up on a stormy cliff through the tempests of an Arctic winter, or
            plunged in a volcano for a hundred years, and yet retain
            consciousness and thought. It is conceivable. Why might not
            psychic natures be enshrined in indestructible flint and
            platinum? These substances are no further from the nature of
            intelligence than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and lime. But, not to
            carry the thought to such an extreme [?], might not high
            intelligence be embodied in frames as indifferent to external
            conditions as the sage of the western plains, or the lichens of
            Labrador, the rotifers which remain dried for years, or the
            bacteria which pass living through boiling water.... These
            suggestions are made simply to remind the reader how little can
            be argued respecting the necessary conditions of intelligent,
            organized existence, from the standard of corporeal existence
            found upon the earth. Intelligence is, from its nature, as
            universal and as uniform as the laws of the universe. Bodies are
            merely the local fitting of intelligence to particular
            modifications of universal matter or force.</span><a href="#note_1047" id="noteref_1047" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a></p>

          through the discoveries of that same all-denying Science that we

          infinitesimally small, are invisible to us by virtue of their
          minuteness, cannot there be, at the other pole, beings as invisible
          owing to the quality of their texture or matter—to its tenuity, in
          fact? Conversely, as to the effects of cometary matter, have we not
          another example of a half visible form of Life and Matter? The ray
          of sunlight entering our apartment reveals in its passage myriads
          of tiny beings living their little life and ceasing to be,
          independent and heedless of whether they are or are not perceived
          by our grosser materiality. And so again, of the microbes and

          the humanity which will evolve millions of years hence will differ
          from our races—appeared but to disappear from the face of the
          Earth, as will our own. These primitive and far-distant humanities
          are denied, because, as Geologists think, they have left no
          tangible relics of themselves. All trace of them is swept away, and
          therefore they have never existed. Yet their relics—though very few
          of them, truly—are to be found, and they must be discovered by
          geological research. But, even if they were never to be met with,
          there would be no reason to say that no men could have ever lived
          in the geological periods to which their presence on earth is
          assigned. For their organisms needed no warm blood, no atmosphere,
          no feeding; the author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">World-Life</span></span> is right, and there
          is no extravagance in believing as we do, that as, on scientific
          hypotheses, there may be to this day <span class="tei tei-q">“psychic natures enshrined in indestructible flint and
          platinum,”</span> so there were psychic natures enshrined in forms
          of equally indestructible Primeval Matter—the real forefathers of
          our Fifth Race.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, therefore,
          as in Volume II, we speak of men who inhabited this Globe
          18,000,000 years ago, we have in mind neither the men of our
          present races, nor the present atmospheric laws, thermal
          conditions, etc. The Earth and Mankind, like the Sun, Moon, and
          Planets, all have their growth, changes, development, and gradual
          evolution in their life-periods; they are born, become infants,
          then children, adolescent, grown-up, they grow old, and finally
          die. Why should not Mankind be also under this universal law? Says
          Uriel to Enoch:</p>

          pass during the period of the Atlanteans, about the middle point of
          their Race, the Fourth, which was drowned, as prophesied by Uriel.
          Since then man has been decreasing in physical stature, strength,
          and years, as will be shown in Volume II. But as we are at the
          mid-point of our sub-race of the Fifth Root-Race—the acme of
          materiality in each—the animal propensities, though more refined,
          are none the less developed; and this is most marked in civilized

          are found corroborated in the Ancient Records. All this will, no

          veritable crime of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lèse-science</span></span>; nevertheless, it
          is a fact.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Science is,

          abscondito</span></span>, can only be judged by the profane through
          her appearance, and that appearance is always deceitful on the
          physical plane. On the other hand, the Naturalists refuse to blend
          Physics with Metaphysics, the Body with its informing Soul and
          Spirit. They prefer to ignore the latter. This is a matter of
          choice with some, while the minority very sensibly strive to
          enlarge the domain of Physical Science by trespassing on the
          forbidden grounds of Metaphysics, so distasteful to some
          Materialists. These Scientists are wise in their generation. For
          all their wonderful discoveries will go for nothing, and remain for
          ever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">headless</span></em> bodies, unless they lift

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of such
          <span class="tei tei-q">“degrading”</span> beliefs—degrading in the
          opinion of the all-denying Sceptic—is found in the idea that
          Kosmos, besides its objective planetary inhabitants, its humanities
          in other inhabited worlds, is full of invisible, intelligent
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Existences</span></em>. The so-called
          Arch-Angels, Angels and Spirits, of the West, copies of their
          prototypes, the Dhyân Chohans, the Devas and Pitris, of the East,
          are not real Beings, but fictions. On this point materialistic
          Science is inexorable. To support its position, it upsets its own
          axiomatic law of uniformity and of continuity in the laws of
          Nature, and all the logical sequence of analogies in the evolution
          of Being. The masses of the profane are asked, and are made to
          believe that the accumulated testimony of History—which shows even
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“Atheists”</span> of old, such men as
          Epicurus and Democritus, as believers in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gods</span></em>—is
          false; and that Philosophers like Socrates and Plato, asserting
          such existences, were mistaken enthusiasts and fools. If we hold
          our opinions merely on historical grounds, on the authority of
          legions of the most eminent Sages, Neo-Platonists, and Mystics in
          all ages, from Pythagoras down to the eminent Scientists and
          Professors of the present century, who, if they reject <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> believe in <span class="tei tei-q">“Spirits,”</span> are we to consider such authorities
          to be as weak-minded and foolish as any Roman Catholic peasant, who
          believes in and prays to his once human Saint, or the Archangel St.
          Michael? But is there no difference between the belief of the
          peasant and that of the Western heirs of the Rosicrucians and
          Alchemists of the Middle Ages? Is it the Van Helmonts, the
          Khunraths, the Paracelsuses and Agrippas, from Roger Bacon down to
          St. Germain, who were all blind enthusiasts, hysteriacs or cheats,
          or is it the handful of modern Sceptics—the <span class="tei tei-q">“leaders of thought”</span>—who are struck with the
          cecity of negation? The latter is the case, we opine. It would
          indeed be a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">miracle</span></em>, quite an abnormal fact in
          the realm of probabilities and logic, were that handful of negators
          to be the sole custodians of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">truth</span></em>, while the million-strong
          hosts of believers in Gods, Angels, and Spirits—in Europe and
          America alone—namely, Greek and Latin Christians, Theosophists,
          Spiritualists, Mystics, etc., should be no better than deluded
          fanatics and hallucinated mediums, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page671">[pg 671]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg671"></a> often no higher than the victims of deceivers
          and impostors! However varying in their external presentations and
          dogmas, beliefs in the Hosts of invisible Intelligences of various
          grades have all the same foundation. Truth and error are mixed in
          all. The exact extent, depth, breadth, and length of the mysteries
          of Nature are to be found only in Eastern Esoteric Science. So vast
          and so profound are these that scarcely even a few, a very few of
          the highest Initiates—those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whose very existence is known but to a small
          number of Adepts</span></em>—are capable of assimilating the
          knowledge. Yet it is all there, and one by one facts and processes
          in Nature's workshops are permitted to find their way into exact
          Science, while mysterious help is given to rare individuals in
          unravelling its arcana. It is at the close of great Cycles, in
          connection with racial development, that such events generally take
          place. We are at the very close of the cycle of 5,000 years of the
          present Âryan Kali Yuga; and between this time and 1897 there will
          be a large rent made in the Veil of Nature, and materialistic
          Science will receive a death-blow.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without throwing
          any discredit upon time-honoured beliefs, in any direction, we are
          forced to draw a marked line between blind faith, evolved by
          theologies, and knowledge due to the independent researches of long
          generations of Adepts; between, in short, faith and Philosophy.
          There have been, in all ages, undeniably learned and good men who,
          having been reared in sectarian beliefs, died in their crystallized
          convictions. For Protestants, the garden of Eden is the primeval
          point of departure in the drama of Humanity, and the solemn tragedy
          on the summit of Calvary is the prelude to the hoped-for
          Millennium. For Roman Catholics, Satan is at the foundation of
          Kosmos, Christ in its centre, and Antichrist at its apex. For both,
          the Hierarchy of Being begins and ends within the narrow frames of
          their respective theologies: one self-created <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">personal</span></em> God, and an empyrean
          ringing with the Hallelujas of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">created</span></em>
          Angels; the rest, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">false</span></em> Gods, Satan and fiends.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theo-Philosophy
          proceeds on broader lines. From the very beginning of æons—in time
          and space in our Round and Globe—the mysteries of Nature (at any
          rate, those which it is lawful for our Races to know) were recorded
          by the pupils of those same, now invisible, <span class="tei tei-q">“Heavenly Men,”</span> in geometrical figures and
          symbols. The keys thereto passed from one generation of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Wise Men”</span> to another. Some of the
          symbols thus passed from the East to the West, brought from the
          Orient by Pythagoras, who was not the inventor of his famous
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page672">[pg 672]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg672"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“Triangle.”</span> The latter figure, along with the
          square and circle, are more eloquent and scientific descriptions of
          the order of the evolution of the Universe, spiritual and psychic,
          as well as physical, than volumes of descriptive Cosmogonies and
          revealed <span class="tei tei-q">“Geneses.”</span> The ten Points
          inscribed within that <span class="tei tei-q">“Pythagorean
          Triangle”</span> are worth all the theogonies and angelologies ever
          emanated from the theological brain. For he who interprets these
          seventeen points (the seven Mathematical Points hidden)—on their
          very face, and in the order given—will find in them the
          uninterrupted series of the genealogies from the first Heavenly to
          Terrestrial Man. And, as they give the order of Beings, so they
          reveal the order in which were evolved the Kosmos, our Earth, and
          the primordial Elements by which the latter was generated. Begotten
          in the invisible <span class="tei tei-q">“Depths,”</span> and in
          the Womb of the same <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother”</span> as its
          fellow-globes—he who masters the mysteries of our own Earth will
          have mastered those of all others.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever
          ignorance, pride or fanaticism may suggest to the contrary,
          Esoteric Cosmology can be shown to be inseparably connected with
          both Philosophy and Modern Science. The Gods and Monads of the
          Ancients—from Pythagoras down to Leibnitz—and the Atoms of the
          present materialistic schools (as borrowed by them from the
          theories of the old Greek Atomists) are only a compound unit, or a
          graduated unity like the human frame, which begins with body and
          ends with Spirit. In the Occult Sciences they can be studied
          separately, but they can never be mastered unless they are viewed
          in their mutual correlations during their life-cycle, and as a
          Universal Unity during Pralayas.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">La Pluche shows
          sincerity, but gives a poor idea of his philosophical capacities,
          when declaring his personal views on the Monad or the Mathematical
          Point. He says:</p>

          generation of the world.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Philosophy,
          however, could never have formed its conception of a logical,
          universal, and absolute Deity, if it had had no Mathematical Point
          within the Circle upon which to base its speculations. It is only
          the manifested Point, lost to our senses after its pregenetic
          appearance in the infinitude and incognizability of the Circle,
          that makes a reconciliation <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page673">[pg 673]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg673"></a> between Philosophy and Theology possible—on
          condition that the latter should abandon its crude materialistic
          dogmas. And it is because Christian theology has so unwisely
          rejected the Pythagorean Monad and geometrical figures, that it has
          evolved its self-created human and personal God, the monstrous Head
          whence flow in two streams the dogmas of Salvation and Damnation.
          This is so true, that even those clergymen who are Masons, and who

          exemplification of the unity of the divine Essence”</span>; for
          this was exemplified by the plane of the boundless Circle. What it
          really meant was the triune coëqual Nature of the first
          differentiated Substance, or the con-substantiality of the
          (manifested) Spirit, Matter and the Universe—their <span class="tei tei-q">“Son”</span>—which proceeds from the Point, the real,
          Esoteric Logos, or Pythagorean Monad. For the Greek Monas signifies

          unable to seize the difference between the Monad—the Universal
          Unit—and the Monads or the manifested Unity, as also between the
          ever-hidden and the revealed Logos, or the Word, ought never to
          meddle with Philosophy, let alone with the Esoteric Sciences. It is
          needless to remind the educated reader of Kant's Thesis to
          demonstrate his second Antinomy.<a href="#note_1053" id="noteref_1053" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1053</span></span></a>
          Those who have read and understood it will see clearly the line we
          draw between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolutely ideal</span></em> Universe and the
          invisible though manifested Kosmos. Our Gods and Monads are not the
          Elements of extension itself, but only those of the invisible
          Reality which is the basis of the manifested Kosmos. Neither
          Esoteric Philosophy, nor Kant, to say nothing of Leibnitz, would
          ever admit that extension can be composed of simple or unextended
          parts. But theologian-philosophers will not grasp this. The Circle
          and the Point—the latter retiring into and merging with the former,
          after having emanated the first three Points and connected them
          with lines, thus forming the first noumenal basis of the Second
          Triangle in the Manifested World—have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page674">[pg 674]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg674"></a> ever been an insuperable obstacle to
          theological flights into dogmatic empyreans. On the authority of
          this Archaic Symbol, a male, personal God, the Creator and Father
          of all, becomes a third-rate emanation, the Sephira standing fourth
          in descent, and on the left hand of Ain Suph, in the Kabalistic
          Tree of Life. Hence, the Monad is degraded into a Vehicle—a

          transcendental application of geometry to cosmic and divine
          theogony—the Alpha and the Omega of mystical conception—was dwarfed
          after Pythagoras by Aristotle. By omitting the Point and the
          Circle, and taking no account of the apex, he reduced the
          metaphysical value of the idea, and thus limited the doctrine of
          magnitude to a simple Triad—the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">line</span></em>,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is argued
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“the human mind cannot conceive an
          indivisible unit short of the annihilation of the idea with its
          subject.”</span> This is an error, as the Pythagoreans have proved,
          and a number of Seers before them, although there is a special
          training needed for the conception, and although the profane mind
          can hardly grasp it. But there are such things as <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Meta-mathematics</span></span>”</span> and

          Mathematics pure and simple proceed from the universal to the
          particular, from the mathematical indivisible point to solid
          figures. The teaching originated in India, and was taught in Europe
          by Pythagoras, who, throwing a veil over the Circle and the
          Point—which no living man can define except as incomprehensible
          abstractions—laid the origin of the differentiated cosmic Matter in
          the base of the Triangle. Thus the latter became the earliest of
          geometrical figures. The author of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">New Aspects of
          Life</span></span>, dealing with the Kabalistic Mysteries, objects
          to the objectivization, so to speak, of the Pythagorean conception
          and the use of the equilateral triangle, and calls it a
          <span class="tei tei-q">“misnomer.”</span> His argument that a

          most of the scientific hypotheses are no better than <span class="tei tei-q">“phantoms of the mind”</span>; they are unverifiable,
          except on inference, and have been adopted merely to answer
          scientific necessities. Furthermore, the ideal
          Triangle—<span class="tei tei-q">“as the abstract idea of a
          triangular body, and, therefore, as the type of an abstract
          idea”</span>—accomplished and carried out to perfection the double
          symbolism intended. As an emblem applicable to the objective idea,
          the simple triangle became a solid. When repeated in stone, facing
          the four cardinal points, it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page677">[pg 677]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg677"></a> assumed the shape of the Pyramid—the symbol

          considered substantial and real, <span class="tei tei-q">“that most

          one, or Chokmah and Binah, and his, or rather their Shekinah or
          synthesizing Spirit (or Grace), which again makes of the Duad a

          than Shakti—the female double of any God—in such case. And so it
          was with the early Christians, whose Holy Spirit was feminine, as
          Sophia was with the Gnostics. But in the transcendental Chaldean
          Kabalah, or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Numbers</span></span>, Shekinah is
          sexless, and the purest abstraction, a state, like Nirvâna, neither

          form no geometrical figure and are the symbol <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page679">[pg 679]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg679"></a> of Matter. Out of this Duad, when
          united in the basic line of the Triangle on the lower plane (the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Every Atom becomes a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">God, Monad, and Atom

          themselves when a form is needed</span></span>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This relates to
          cosmic and sub-planetary Monads, not to the super-cosmic Monads,
          the Pythagorean Monad, as it is called, in its synthetic character,
          by the Pantheistical Peripatetics. The Monads of the present

          individuality, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Atomic Souls</span></em>, before these Atoms
          descend into pure terrestrial form. For this descent into
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">concrete</span></em> Matter marks the medial
          point of their own individual pilgrimage. Here, losing in the
          mineral kingdom their individuality, they begin to ascend through
          the seven states of terrestrial evolution to that point where a
          correspondence is firmly established between the human and Deva
          (divine) consciousness. At present, however, we are not concerned
          with their terrestrial metamorphoses and tribulations, but with
          their life and behaviour in Space, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page680">[pg 680]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg680"></a> on planes wherein the eye of the most

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is well known
          that Leibnitz came very near the truth several times, but he
          defined Monadic Evolution incorrectly, a thing not to be wondered
          at, since he was not an Initiate, nor even a Mystic, but only a
          very intuitional Philosopher. Yet no Psycho-physicist ever came
          nearer than has he to the Esoteric general outline of evolution.
          This evolution—viewed from its several standpoints, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,
          as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Universal</span></em> and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Individualized</span></em> Monad, and the
          chief aspects of the Evolving Energy after differentiation, the
          purely Spiritual, the Intellectual, the Psychic and the
          Physical—may be thus formulated as an invariable law: a descent of
          Spirit into Matter, equivalent to an ascent in physical evolution;
          a reäscent from the depths of materiality towards its <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">status quo
          ante</span></span>, with a corresponding dissipation of concrete
          form and substance up to the Laya-state, or what Science calls the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“zero-point,”</span> and beyond.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
          states—once the spirit of Esoteric Philosophy is grasped—become
          absolutely necessary from simple logical and analogical
          considerations. Physical Science having now ascertained, through
          its department of Chemistry, the invariable law of this evolution
          of Atoms—from their <span class="tei tei-q">“protylean”</span>
          state down to that of a physical and then a chemical particle, or
          molecule—cannot well reject these states as a general law. And once
          it is forced by its enemies—Metaphysics and Psychology<a href="#note_1068" id="noteref_1068" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1068</span></span></a>—out
          of its alleged impregnable strongholds, it will find it more
          difficult than it now appears to refuse room in the Spaces of

          (Gods), Elementals, and even the Elementary Spooks or Ghosts, and
          others. Already Figuier and Paul D'Assier, two Positivists and
          Materialists, have succumbed before this logical necessity. Other
          and still greater Scientists will follow in that intellectual
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Fall.”</span> They will be driven out of
          their position not by spiritual, theosophical, or any other

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may take as
          an example, Mr. W. Crookes' latest discovery of what he has named
          Protyle. In the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Notes on the Bhagavad Gîtâ</span></span>, by
          one of the best metaphysicians and Vedântic scholars in India, the
          lecturer, referring cautiously to <span class="tei tei-q">“things
          Occult”</span> in that great Indian Esoteric work, makes a remark
          as suggestive as it is strictly correct. He says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">

<span style="font-size: 90%">in which the various elements start
          into existence from these three principles into which Mûlaprakriti
          [the Pythagorean Triangle] is differentiated, by examining the
          lecture delivered by Professor Crookes a short time ago upon the
          so-called elements of modern chemistry. This lecture will give you
          some idea of the way in which these so-called elements spring from
          Vishvânara,</span><a href="#note_1069" id="noteref_1069" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1069</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">the most objective of these three

<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">protyle</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">mentioned in that lecture. Except in a
          few particulars, this lecture seems to give the outlines of the
          theory of physical evolution on the plane of Vishvânara, and is, so
          far as I know, the nearest approach made by modern investigators to
          the real occult theory on the subject.</span><a href="#note_1070" id="noteref_1070" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1070</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These words will
          be reëchoed and approved by every Eastern Occultist. Much from the
          lectures by Mr. Crookes has already been quoted in Section XI. A
          second lecture has been delivered by him, as remarkable as the
          first, on the <span class="tei tei-q">“Genesis of the
          Elements,”</span><a href="#note_1071" id="noteref_1071" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a> and
          also a third one. Here we have almost a corroboration of the
          teachings of Esoteric Philosophy concerning the mode of primeval
          evolution. It is, indeed, as near an approach, made by a great
          scholar and specialist in Chemistry,<a href="#note_1072" id="noteref_1072" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1072</span></span></a> to
          the Secret Doctrine, as could be made apart from the application of
          the Monads and Atoms to the dogmas of pure transcendental
          Metaphysics, and their connection and correlation with <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods and intelligent conscious Monads.”</span> But
          Chemistry is now on its ascending plane, thanks to one of its
          highest European representatives. It is impossible for it to go
          back to that day when Materialism regarded its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sub</span></em>-elements as absolutely simple
          and homogeneous bodies, which it had raised, in its blindness, to
          the rank of Elements. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page682">[pg
          682]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg682"></a>
          The mask has been snatched off by too clever a hand for there to be
          any fear of a new disguise. And after years of pseudology, of
          bastard molecules parading under the name of Elements, behind and
          beyond which there could be nought but void, a great professor of
          Chemistry asks once more:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">

          is their signification?... These elements perplex us in our
          researches, baffle us in our speculations, and haunt us in our very
          dreams. They stretch like an unknown sea before us—mocking,
          mystifying, and murmuring strange revelations and
          possibilities.</span><a href="#note_1073" id="noteref_1073" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1073</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who are
          heirs to primeval revelations have taught these <span class="tei tei-q">“possibilities”</span> in every century, but have never
          found a fair hearing. The truths inspired into Kepler, Leibnitz,
          Gassendi, Swedenborg, etc., were ever alloyed with their own
          speculations in one or another predetermined direction—hence were
          distorted. But now one of the great truths has dawned upon an
          eminent professor of exact Modern Science, and he fearlessly
          proclaims as a fundamental axiom that Science has not made itself
          acquainted, so far, with real simple Elements. For Mr. Crookes
          tells his audience:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">

          but have been evolved from simpler matters—or perhaps, indeed, from
          one sole kind of matter—I do but give formal utterance to an idea
          which has been, so to speak, for some time</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">in the air</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">of
          science. Chemists, physicists, philosophers of the highest merit,
          declare explicitly their belief that the seventy (or thereabouts)
          elements of our text-books are not the pillars of Hercules which we
          must never hope to pass.... Philosophers in the present as in the
          past—men who certainly have not worked in the laboratory—have
          reached the same view from another side. Thus Mr. Herbert Spencer
          records his conviction that</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">the chemical atoms are produced from the true or
          physical atoms by processes of evolution under conditions which
          chemistry has not yet been able to produce.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">...
          And the poet has forestalled the philosopher. Milton
          (</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">Paradise
          Lost</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, Book V.) makes the
          Archangel Raphael say to Adam instinct with the evolutionary idea,
          that the Almighty had created</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,

          descended into the thick atmosphere of Materialism and profane
          mortals for years to come, perhaps, had not Mr. Crookes bravely and
          fearlessly reduced it to its simple constituents, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page683">[pg 683]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg683"></a> and thus publicly forced it on
          scientific notice. Says Plutarch:</p>

          Galileo, Torricelli, and Swedenborg, and after them to the latest
          speculations by European Mystics—all this is found in the Hindû
          Hymns, or Mantras, to the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods, Monads and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">the answer is

          few. The scientific possibilities of various discoveries, that must
          inexorably lead exact Science into the acceptation of Eastern

          filling of those <span class="tei tei-q">“gaps,”</span> are, so

          Elements</span></span>, and ponder well over some passages of the
          text. In one place he says:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Our notions of a chemical element have expanded.
          Hitherto the molecule has been regarded as an aggregate of two or
          more atoms, and no account has been taken of the architectural
          design on which these atoms have been joined. We may consider that
          the structure of a chemical element is more complicated than has
          hitherto been supposed. Between the molecules we are accustomed to
          deal with in chemical reactions and ultimate atoms as first
          created, come smaller molecules or aggregates of physical atoms;
          these sub-molecules differ one from the other, according to the
          position they occupy in the yttrium edifice.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Perhaps this hypothesis can be simplified if we

            chemical fractionation I have divided it into five separate
            shillings, and find that these shillings are not counterparts,
            but like the carbon atoms in the benzol ring, have the impress of
            their position, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, stamped on them.... If I throw my
            shillings into the melting-pot or dissolve them chemically, the

          constant ... then such metal must rightly take rank among the
          simple or elementary bodies. We learn ... that this is no longer
          the case. Again, we have here wheels within wheels. Gadolinium is
          not an element but a compound. ... We have shown that yttrium is a
          complex of five or more new constituents. And who shall venture to
          gainsay that each of these constituents, if attacked in some
          different manner, and if the result were submitted to a test more
          delicate and searching than the radiant-matter test, might not be
          still further divisible? Where, then, is the actual ultimate
          element? As we advance it recedes like the tantalizing mirage lakes
          and groves seen by the tired and thirsty traveller in the desert.
          Are we in our quest for truth to be thus deluded and baulked? The
          very idea of an element, as something absolutely primary and
          ultimate, seems to be growing less and less
            distinct.</span><a href="#note_1078" id="noteref_1078" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a></p>

          to overstep the forbidden boundaries.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is time
          to leave Modern Physical Science and turn to the psychological and
          metaphysical side of the question. We would only remark that to the

          required by the eminent lecturer, <span class="tei tei-q">“to get a

          no battering at it should avail; the postulate that Leibnitz stood
          on a firm groundwork of fact and truth in his speculations. The
          admirable and thoughtful synopsis of these speculations—as given by
          John Theodore Mertz in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Leibnitz”</span>—shows how nearly he has brushed the
          hidden secrets of Esoteric Theogony in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monadologie</span></span>. And yet this
          philosopher has hardly risen in his speculations above the first
          planes, the lower principles of the Cosmic Great Body. His theory
          soars to no loftier heights than those of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manifested</span></em> life,
          self-consciousness and intelligence, leaving the regions of the
          earlier post-genetic mysteries untouched, as his ethereal fluid is
          post-planetary.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this third
          postulate will hardly be accepted by the modern men of Science;
          and, like Descartes, they will prefer keeping to the properties of
          external things, which, like extension, are incapable of explaining
          the phenomenon of motion, rather than accept the latter as an
          independent Force. They will never become anti-Cartesian in this
          generation; nor will they admit that:</p>

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
          Leibnitz's idea as analyzed by Mertz, who adds that he called this
          <span class="tei tei-q">“something”</span> Force, and maintained
          that external things were endowed with Force, and that in order to
          be the bearers of this Force they must have a Substance, for they
          are not lifeless and inert masses, but the centres and bearers of
          Form—a purely Esoteric claim, since Force was with Leibnitz an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">active</span></em> principle—the division
          between Mind and Matter disappearing by this conclusion.</p>

          Leibnitz would not have led to the same result in the mind of a

          in the modern sense of the word. Had he been so, he might have
          worked out the conception of energy, defined mathematically the
          ideas of force and</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page688">[pg

          and arrived at the conclusion that even for purely scientific
          purposes it is desirable to look upon force, not as a primary
          quantity, but as a quantity derived from some other
          value.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, luckily for
          truth:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Leibnitz was a philosopher; and as such he had
          certain primary principles, which biassed him in favour of certain
          conclusions, and his discovery that external things were substances
          endowed with force was at once used for the purpose of applying
          these principles. One of these principles was the law of
          continuity, the conviction that all the world was connected, that
          there were no gaps and chasms which could not be bridged over. The
          contrast of extended thinking substances was unbearable to him. The
          definition of the extended substances had already become untenable:
          it was natural that a similar enquiry was made into the definition
          of mind, the thinking substance.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The divisions
          made by Leibnitz, however incomplete and faulty from the standpoint
          of Occultism, show a spirit of metaphysical intuition to which no
          man of Science, not Descartes, not even Kant, has ever reached.
          With him there existed ever an infinite gradation of thought. Only
          a small portion of the contents of our thoughts, he said, rises
          into the clearness of apperception, <span class="tei tei-q">“into
          the light of perfect consciousness.”</span> Many remain in a
          confused or obscure state, in the state of <span class="tei tei-q">“perceptions”</span>; but they are there. Descartes
          denied soul to the animal. Leibnitz, as do the Occultists, endowed
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole creation with mental life, this
          being, according to him, capable of infinite gradations.”</span>
          And this, as Mertz justly observes:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">

<span style="font-size: 90%">and</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">inanimate
          matter</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; it did yet more—it
          reäcted on the conception of matter, of the extended substance. For
          it became evident that external or material things presented the
          property of extension to our senses only, not to our thinking
          faculties. The mathematician, in order to calculate geometrical
          figures, had been obliged to divide them into an infinite number of
          infinitely small parts, and the physicist saw no limit to the
          divisibility of matter into atoms. The bulk through which external
          things seemed to fill space was a property which they acquired only
          through the coarseness of our senses.... Leibnitz followed these
          arguments to some extent, but he could not rest content in assuming
          that matter was composed of a finite number of very small parts.
          His mathematical mind forced him to carry out the argument</span>
<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">in
          infinitum</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">. And what
          became of the atoms then? They lost their extension and they
          retained only their property of resistance; they were the centres
          of force. They were reduced to mathematical points.... But if their
          extension in space was nothing,</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">so
          much fuller was their inner life</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">. Assuming that inner existence, such as that of
          the human mind, is a new dimension, not a geometrical but a
          metaphysical dimension, ... having reduced the geometrical
          extension of the atoms to nothing, Leibnitz endowed them with an
          infinite extension in the</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page689">[pg 689]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg689"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">direction of
          their metaphysical dimension. After having lost sight of them in
          the world of space, the mind has, as it were, to dive into a
          metaphysical world to find and grasp the real essence of what
          appears in space merely as a mathematical point.... As a cone
          stands on its point, or a perpendicular straight line cuts a
          horizontal plane only in one mathematical point, but may extend
          infinitely in height and depth, so the essences of</span>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">things real</span></em>
<span style="font-size: 90%">have only a punctual existence in

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The student must
          now be shown the fundamental distinction between the system of
          Leibnitz<a href="#note_1085" id="noteref_1085" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1085</span></span></a> and
          that of Occult Philosophy, on the question of the Monads, and this
          may be done with his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Monadologie</span></span> before us. It may be
          correctly stated that were Leibnitz' and Spinoza's systems
          reconciled, the essence and spirit of Esoteric Philosophy would be
          made to appear. From the shock of the two—as opposed to the
          Cartesian system—emerge the truths of the Archaic Doctrine. Both
          oppose the Metaphysics of Descartes. His idea of the contrast of
          two Substances—Extension and Thought—radically differing from each
          other and mutually irreducible, is too arbitrary and too
          un-philosophical for them. Thus Leibnitz made of the two Cartesian
          Substances two attributes of one universal Unity, in which he saw
          God. Spinoza recognized but one universal indivisible Substance, an
          absolute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>, like Parabrahman.
          Leibnitz, on the contrary, perceived the existence of a plurality
          of Substances. There was but One for Spinoza; for Leibnitz an
          infinitude of Beings, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from</span></em>, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in</span></em>, the
          One. Hence, though both admitted but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One Real
          Entity</span></em>, while Spinoza made it impersonal and
          indivisible, Leibnitz divided his personal Deity into a number of
          divine and semi-divine Beings. Spinoza was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em>, Leibnitz an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> Pantheist, yet both were
          great Philosophers in their intuitive perceptions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, if these
          two teachings were blended together and each corrected <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page690">[pg 690]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg690"></a> by the other—and foremost of all the
          One Reality weeded of its personality—there would remain as sum
          total a true spirit of Esoteric Philosophy in them; the impersonal,
          attributeless, absolute Divine Essence, which is no <span class="tei tei-q">“being”</span> but the root of all Being. Draw a deep
          line in your thought between that ever-incognizable Essence, and

          as of semi-conscious, <span class="tei tei-q">“apperceptive”</span>
          and <span class="tei tei-q">“perceptive”</span> Beings, whose
          Essence is spiritual Force, whose Substance is the Elements, and
          whose Bodies (when needed) are the Atoms—and our Doctrine is there.
          For, says Leibnitz:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The primitive element of every material body being
          force, which has none of the characteristics of [objective]
          matter—it can be conceived but can never be the object of any
          imaginative representation.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which was
          for him the primordial and ultimate element in everybody and object
          was thus not the material atoms, or molecules, necessarily more or
          less extended, as those of Epicurus and Gassendi, but, as Mertz
          shows, immaterial and metaphysical Atoms, <span class="tei tei-q">“mathematical points,”</span> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real
          souls</span></em>—as explained by Henri Lachelier (Professeur
          Agrégé de Philosophie), his French biographer.</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">That which exists outside of us in an absolute

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reality</span></em>
          in the manifested world is composed of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unity of
          units</span></em>, so to say, immaterial—from our standpoint—and
          infinite. These Leibnitz calls Monads, Eastern Philosophy Jîvas,
          while Occultism, with the Kabalists and all the Christians, gives
          them a variety of names. With us, as with Leibnitz, they are
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the expression of the
          universe,”</span><a href="#note_1087" id="noteref_1087" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1087</span></span></a> and
          every physical point is but the phenomenal expression of the
          noumenal, metaphysical Point. His distinction between <span class="tei tei-q">“perception”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“apperception”</span> is the philosophical though dim
          expression of the Esoteric Teachings. His <span class="tei tei-q">“reduced universes,”</span> of which <span class="tei tei-q">“there are as many as there are Monads”</span>—is the
          chaotic representation of our Septenary System with its divisions
          and sub-divisions.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the
          relation his Monads bear to our Dhyân Chohans, Cosmic Spirits,
          Devas, and Elementals, we may reproduce briefly the opinion
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page691">[pg 691]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg691"></a> of a learned and
          thoughtful Theosophist, Mr. C. H. A. Bjerregaard, on the subject.
          In an excellent paper, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Elementals,
          the Elementary Spirits, and the Relationship between Them and Human
          Beings,”</span> read by him before the Âryan Theosophical Society
          of New York, Mr. Bjerregaard thus distinctly formulates his
          opinion:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-left: 3.60em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-bottom: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">To Spinoza, substance is dead and inactive, but to
          Leibnitz's penetrating powers of mind everything is living activity
          and active energy. In holding this view, he comes infinitely nearer
          the Orient than any other thinker of his day, or after him. His
          discovery that</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">an active energy forms the
          essence of substance</span></em> <span style="font-size: 90%">is a
          principle that places him in direct relationship to the Seers of
          the East.</span><a href="#note_1088" id="noteref_1088" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1088</span></span></a></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the lecturer
          proceeds to show that to Leibnitz Atoms and Elements are
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Centres
          of Force</span></span>, or rather <span class="tei tei-q">“spiritual beings whose very nature it is to
          act,”</span> for the</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Elementary particles are vital forces, not acting
          mechanically, but from an internal principle. They are incorporeal
          spiritual units [</span><span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">substantial,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">however, but not</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">immaterial</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">in
          our sense] inaccessible to all change from without ... [and]
          indestructible by any external force. Leibnitz' monads differ from
          atoms in the following particulars, which are very important for us
          to remember, otherwise we shall not be able to see the difference
          between Elementals and mere matter. Atoms are not distinguished
          from each other, they are qualitatively alike; but one monad
          differs from every other monad qualitatively; and every one is a
          peculiar world to itself. Not so with the atoms; they are
          absolutely alike quantitatively and qualitatively, and possess no
          individuality of their own.</span><a href="#note_1089" id="noteref_1089" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1089</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Again, the atoms [molecules, rather]
          of materialistic philosophy can be considered as extended and
          divisible, while the monads are mere</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">metaphysical points</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">and
          indivisible. Finally, and this is a point where these monads of
          Leibnitz closely resemble the Elementals of mystic philosophy,
          these monads are representative beings. Every monad reflects every
          other. Every monad is a living mirror of the Universe within its
          own sphere. And mark this, for upon it depends the power possessed
          by these monads, and upon it depends the work they can do for us;
          in mirroring the world, the monads are not mere passive reflective
          agents, but</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-style: italic">spontaneously self
          active</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">; they produce the
          images spontaneously, as the soul does a dream. In every monad,
          therefore, the adept may read everything, even the future. Every
          monad—or Elemental—is a looking-glass that can speak.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is at this
          point that Leibnitz's philosophy breaks down. There is no provision
          made, nor any distinction established, between the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elemental”</span> Monad and that of a high Planetary
          Spirit, or even the Human Monad or Soul. He even goes so far as to
          sometimes doubt whether</p>

          because, as he repeatedly states:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em">

</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But soon after
          he finds a provision for this in a substantial correspondence, a
          certain metaphysical bond between the Monads—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">vinculum
          substantiale</span></span>. Esoteric Philosophy, teaching an
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> Idealism—though it
          regards the objective Universe and all in it as Mâyâ, Temporary
          Illusion—draws a practical distinction between Collective Illusion,
          Mahâmâyâ, from the purely metaphysical standpoint, and the
          objective relations in it between various conscious Egos so long as
          this Illusion lasts. The Adept, therefore, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em>
          read the future in an Elemental Monad, but he has to draw together
          for this object a great number of them, as each Monad represents

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And as Leibnitz

          what is called collectively Monads by Leibnitz—roughly viewed, and
          leaving every subdivision out of calculation, for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page693">[pg 693]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg693"></a> the present—may be separated into three

          which, counted from the highest planes, are, firstly, <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> or conscious, spiritual Egos; the
          intelligent Architects, who work after the plan in the Divine Mind.
          Then come the Elementals, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Monads,”</span> who form collectively and
          unconsciously the grand Universal Mirrors of everything connected
          with their respective realms. Lastly, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Atoms,”</span> or material molecules, which are
          informed in their turn by their <span class="tei tei-q">“perceptive”</span> Monads, just as every cell in a
          human body is so informed. There are shoals of such <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">informed</span></em> Atoms which, in their
          turn, inform the molecules; an infinitude of Monads, or Elementals
          proper, and countless spiritual Forces—Monadless, for they are pure
          incorporealities,<a href="#note_1095" id="noteref_1095" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1095</span></span></a>
          except under certain laws, when they assume a form—not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessarily</span></em> human. Whence the
          substance that clothes them—the apparent organism they evolve
          around their centres? The Formless (Arûpa) Radiations, existing in
          the harmony of Universal Will, and being what we term the
          collective or the aggregate of Cosmic Will on the plane of the
          subjective Universe, unite together an infinitude of Monads—each
          the mirror of its own Universe—and thus individualize for the time
          being an independent Mind, omniscient and universal; and by the
          same process of magnetic aggregation they create for themselves
          objective, visible bodies, out of the interstellar Atoms. For Atoms
          and Monads, associated or dissociated, simple or complex, are, from
          the moment of the first differentiation, but the <span class="tei tei-q">“principles,”</span> corporeal, psychic and spiritual,
          of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods”</span>—themselves the
          Radiations of Primordial Nature. Thus, to the eye of the Seer, the
          higher Planetary Powers appear under two aspects: the subjective—as
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">influences</span></em>, and the objective—as
          mystic <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forms</span></em>, which, under Karmic law,
          become a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Presence</span></em>, Spirit and Matter being
          One, as repeatedly stated. Spirit is Matter <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on the seventh
          plane</span></em>; Matter is Spirit at the lowest point of its
          cyclic activity; and both are—Mâyâ.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page694">[pg 694]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg694"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Atoms are called
          Vibrations in Occultism; also Sound—collectively. This does not
          interfere with Mr. Tyndall's scientific discovery. He traced, on
          the lower rung of the ladder of monadic being, the whole course of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">atmospheric</span></em> Vibrations—and this
          constitutes the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">objective</span></em> part of the process in
          Nature. He has traced and recorded the rapidity of their motion and
          transmission; the force of their impact; their setting up
          vibrations in the tympanum and their transmission of these to the
          otoliths, etc., till the vibration of the auditory nerve
          commences—and a new phenomenon now takes place: the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective</span></em> side of the process or
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sensation</span></em> of sound. Does he
          perceive or see it? No; for his specialty is to discover the
          behaviour of Matter. But why should not a Psychic see it, a
          spiritual Seer, whose inner Eye is opened, one who can see through
          the veil of Matter? The waves and undulations of Science are all
          produced by Atoms propelling their molecules into activity
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from
          within</span></em>. Atoms fill the immensity of Space, and by their
          continuous vibration <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Motion</span></span> which keeps the
          wheels of Life perpetually going. It is that inner work that
          produces the natural phenomenon called the correlation of Forces.
          Only, at the origin of every such <span class="tei tei-q">“Force,”</span> there stands the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conscious</span></em> guiding Noumenon
          thereof—Angel or God, Spirit or Demon, ruling powers, yet the
          same.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As described by
          Seers—those who can see the motion of the interstellar shoals, and
          follow them clairvoyantly in their evolution—they are dazzling,
          like specks of virgin snow in radiant sunlight. Their velocity is
          swifter than thought, quicker than any mortal physical eye can
          follow, and, as well as can be judged from the tremendous rapidity
          of their course, the motion is circular. Standing on an open plain,
          on a mountain summit especially, and gazing into the vast vault
          above and the spatial infinitudes around, the whole atmosphere
          seems ablaze with them, the air soaked through with these dazzling
          coruscations. At times, the intensity of their motion produces
          flashes like the Northern Lights in the Aurora Borealis. The sight
          is so marvellous, that, as the Seer gazes into this inner world,
          and feels the scintillating points shoot past him, he is filled
          with awe at the thought of other, still greater mysteries, that lie
          beyond, and within, this radiant ocean.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However
          imperfect and incomplete this explanation on <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods, Monads and Atoms,”</span> it is hoped that some
          students and Theosophists, at least, will feel that there may
          indeed be a close relation between Materialistic Science and
          Occultism, which is the complement and missing soul of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The One Life is
          closely related to the One Law which governs the World of
          Being—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Karma</span></span>. Exoterically, this
          is simply and literally <span class="tei tei-q">“action,”</span> or
          rather an <span class="tei tei-q">“effect-producing cause.”</span>
          Esoterically, it is quite a different thing in its far-reaching
          moral effects. It is the unerring <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Law of
          Retribution</span></span>. To say to those ignorant of the real
          significance, characteristics, and awful importance of this eternal
          immutable Law, that no theological definition of a Personal Deity
          can give an idea of this impersonal, yet ever present and active
          Principle, is to speak in vain. Nor can it be called Providence.
          For Providence, with the Theists—the Protestant Christians, at any
          rate—rejoices in a personal male gender, while with the Roman
          Catholics it is a female potency. <span class="tei tei-q">“Divine
          Providence tempers His blessings to secure their better
          effects,”</span> Wogan tells us. Indeed <span class="tei tei-q">“He”</span> tempers them, which Karma—a sexless
          principle—does not.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is not
          Physical Science that we can ever ask to read man for us, as the
          riddle of the Past, or of the Future; since no Philosopher can tell
          us even what man is, as known to both Physiology and Psychology. In
          doubt whether man was a God or a beast, Science has now connected
          him with the latter and derives him from an animal. Certainly the
          task of analyzing and classifying the human being as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">terrestrial

          and the wonderful work it has done, the progress achieved in
          Physiology, and even—to a degree—in Biology. But man's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inner</span></em>,
          spiritual, psychic, or even moral, nature cannot be left to the
          tender mercies of an ingrained Materialism; for not even the higher
          psychological Philosophy of the West is able, in its present
          incompleteness and tendency towards a decided Agnosticism, to do
          justice to the inner man; especially to his higher capacities and
          perceptions, and to those states of consciousness, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page698">[pg 698]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg698"></a> across the road to which such

          conclusions built on preconceived theories and made to fit in with
          certain prejudices. The premisses of Scientists may or may not be
          always true; and as some of these theories live but a short life,
          the deductions therefrom must ever be one-sided with materialistic
          Evolutionists. Yet it is on the strength of such very ephemeral

          life? Even exoteric Philosophy explains that these perpetual

          intelligently, in Space and Eternity. There are <span class="tei tei-q">“Cycles of Matter,”</span><a href="#note_1099" id="noteref_1099" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a> and

          inconsistent matter, and assert his superiority over all insentient
          and perishable forms of being. There is a method in the succession
          of events, and in the relation of coëxistent things, which the mind

          closer the approach to one's Prototype, in <span class="tei tei-q">“Heaven,”</span> the better for the mortal whose

          to him—either in the snowy white robes of the martyr, or in the

          from birth to death, every man weaves thread by thread round
          himself, as a spider his web; and this Destiny is guided either by
          the heavenly voice of the invisible Prototype outside of us, or by
          our more intimate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">astral</span></em>, or inner man, who is but
          too often the evil genius of the embodied entity called man. Both
          these lead on the outward man, but one of them must prevail; and
          from the very beginning of the invisible affray the stern and

          this <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">self-made</span></em> Destiny. It then either
          fixes him like the inert shell against the immovable rock, or

          so much insisted upon by Materialism, are a fundamental principle
          of the Occult Philosophy; but this unity rests upon the

          Nature; a hidden, most profoundly hidden unconscious instinct, and
          the whole process of History ... is directed to rendering this
          unconscious impulse a conscious one. Thus appearing in the form of
          merely natural existence, natural will—that which has been called
          the subjective side—physical craving, instinct, passion, private
          interest, as also opinion and subjective conception—spontaneously
          present themselves at the very commencement. This vast congeries of
          volitions, interests and activities constitute the instruments and
          means of the World-Spirit for attaining its object; bringing it to
          consciousness and realizing it. And this aim is none other than
          finding itself—coming to itself—and contemplating itself in
          concrete actuality. But that those manifestations of vitality on
          the part of individuals and peoples, in which they seek and satisfy
          their own purposes, are at the same time the means and instruments
          of a higher and broader purpose of which they know nothing—which
          they realize unconsciously—might be made a matter of question;
          rather has been questioned ... on this point I announced my view at
          the very outset, and asserted our hypothesis ... and our belief

          geological life of our globe, as in the history, past and future,
          of races and nations. This is closely connected with what we call
          Karma, and what Western Pantheists called Nemesis and Cycles. The
          law of evolution is now carrying us along the ascending arc of
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> cycle, when the effects will

          Science, which shows Nature ever acting with a given purpose, whose
          results are always dual. This was stated in our first Occult

          recommenced within the Great Saros. The revolution of the physical
          world, according to the ancient doctrine, is attended by a like
          revolution in the world of intellect—the spiritual evolution of the
          world proceeding in cycles, like the physical one. Thus we see in
          history a regular alternation of ebb and flow in the tide of human
          progress. The great kingdoms and empires of the world, after
          reaching the culmination of their greatness, descend again, in
          accordance with the same law by which they ascended; till, having
          reached the lowest point, humanity reässerts itself and mounts up
          once more, the height of its attainment being, by this law of
          ascending progression by cycles, somewhat higher than the point

          relations with, and action upon, the respective positions of
          nations and races, in their destiny and evolution. This system
          cannot be comprehended if the spiritual action of these
          periods—<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">preördained</span></em>, so to say, by Karmic
          law—is separated from their physical course. The calculations of
          the best Astrologers would fail, or at any rate remain imperfect,

          includes the progress of mankind from the appearance of primordial
          man of ethereal form. It runs through the inner Cycles of man's
          progressive evolution from the ethereal down to the semi-ethereal
          and purely physical; down to the redemption of man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page704">[pg 704]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg704"></a> from his <span class="tei tei-q">“coat
          of skin”</span> and matter, after which it continues running its
          course downward and then upward again, to meet at the culmination
          of a Round, when the Manvantaric Serpent <span class="tei tei-q">“swallows its tail”</span> and seven Minor Cycles are
          passed. These are the great Racial Cycles which affect equally all
          the nations and tribes included in that special Race; but there are
          minor and national, as well as tribal, Cycles within these, which
          run their course independently of each other. They are called in
          Eastern Esotericism the Karmic Cycles. In the West—since Pagan
          Wisdom has been repudiated as having grown from and been developed
          by the Dark Powers, supposed to be at constant war with and in
          opposition to the little tribal Jehovah—the full and awful
          significance of the Greek Nemesis, or Karma, has been entirely
          forgotten. Otherwise Christians would have better realized the
          profound truth that Nemesis is without attributes; that while the
          dreaded Goddess is absolute and immutable as a Principle, it is we
          ourselves—nations and individuals—who propel it to action and give
          the impulse to its direction. Karma-Nemesis is the creator of
          nations and mortals, but once created, it is they who make of her
          either a Fury or a rewarding Angel. Yea—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">—as the Chorus

          her attributes only on Earth, and begotten by ourselves. There is
          no return from the paths she cycles over; yet those paths are of
          our own making, for it is we, collectively or individually, who
          prepare them. Karma-Nemesis is the synonym of Providence,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">minus</span></em> design, goodness, and every
          other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">finite</span></em> attribute and
          qualification, so unphilosophically attributed to the latter. An
          Occultist or a Philosopher will not speak of the goodness or
          cruelty of Providence; but, identifying it with Karma-Nemesis, he
          will nevertheless teach that it guards the good and watches over
          them in this, as in future lives; and that it punishes the
          evil-doer—aye, even to his seventh rebirth—so long, indeed, as the
          effect of his having thrown into perturbation even the smallest
          atom in the Infinite World of Harmony has not been finally
          reädjusted. For the only decree of Karma—an eternal and immutable
          decree—is absolute Harmony in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page705">[pg 705]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg705"></a> world of Matter as it is in the world of
          Spirit. It is not, therefore, Karma that rewards or punishes, but
          it is we who reward or punish ourselves, according as we work with,
          through and along with Nature, abiding by the laws on which that
          harmony depends, or—breaking them.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor would the
          ways of Karma be inscrutable were men to work in union and harmony,
          instead of disunion and strife. For our ignorance of these
          ways—which one portion of mankind calls the ways of Providence,
          dark and intricate, while another sees in them the action of blind
          Fatalism, and a third, simple Chance, with neither Gods nor Devils
          to guide them—would surely disappear, if we would but attribute all
          of them to their correct cause. With right knowledge, or at any
          rate with a confident conviction that our neighbours would no more
          work to hurt us than we would think of harming them, two-thirds of
          the world's evil would vanish into thin air. Were no man to hurt
          his brother, Karma-Nemesis would have neither cause to work for,
          nor weapons to act through. It is the constant presence in our
          midst of every element of strife and opposition, and the division
          of races, nations, tribes, societies and individuals into Cains and
          Abels, wolves and lambs, that is the chief cause of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ways of Providence.”</span> We cut these
          numerous windings in our destinies daily with our own hands, while
          we imagine that we are pursuing a track on the royal high road of
          respectability and duty, and then we complain because these
          windings are so intricate and so dark. We stand bewildered before
          the mystery of our own making, and the riddles of life that
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we will
          not</span></em> solve, and then accuse the great Sphinx of
          devouring us. But verily there is not an accident in our lives, not
          a misshapen day, or a misfortune, that could not be traced back to
          our own doings in this or in another life. If one breaks the laws
          of Harmony, or, as a theosophical writer expresses it, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“laws of life,”</span> one must be prepared
          to fall into the chaos oneself has produced. For, according to the
          same writer:</p>
<div class="block tei tei-quote" style="margin-right: 3.60em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-top: 1.80em">
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The only conclusion one can come to is that these
          laws of life are their own avengers; and consequently that every
          avenging angel is only a typified representation of their
          reäction.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Therefore, if
          any one is helpless before these immutable laws, it is not
          ourselves, the artificers of our destinies, but rather those
          Angels, the guardians of Harmony. Karma-Nemesis is no more than the
          spiritual dynamical effect of causes produced, and forces awakened
          into activity, by our own actions. It is a law of Occult dynamics
          that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page706">[pg 706]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg706"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“a given amount of energy expended on the spiritual or
          astral plane is productive of far greater results than the same
          amount expended on the physical objective plane of
          existence.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This condition
          of things will last till man's spiritual intuitions are fully
          opened, and this will not be until we fairly cast off our thick
          coats of Matter; until we begin acting from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">within</span></em>,
          instead of ever following impulses from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em>, impulses produced by our
          physical senses and gross selfish body. Until then the only
          palliatives for the evils of life are union and harmony—a
          Brotherhood <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in actu</span></span>, and Altruism not simply
          in name. The suppression of one single bad <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cause</span></em>
          will suppress not one, but many bad effects. And if a Brotherhood,
          or even a number of Brotherhoods, may not be able to prevent
          nations from occasionally cutting each other's throats, still unity
          in thought and action, and philosophical research into the
          mysteries of being, will always prevent some persons, who are
          trying to comprehend that which has hitherto remained to them a
          riddle, from creating additional causes of mischief in a world
          already so full of woe and evil. Knowledge of Karma gives the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and such are now
          the ways on which the great European nations move onward. Every
          nation and tribe of the Western Âryans, like their Eastern brethren
          of the Fifth Race, has had its Golden and its Iron Age, its period
          of comparative irresponsibility, or its Satya Age of purity, and

          latter are inseparably blended with the destinies of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page707">[pg 707]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg707"></a> nations and men. But, in the purely
          physical sense, Europe knows of no Cycles other than the
          astronomical, and it makes its computations accordingly. Nor will
          it hear of any other than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imaginary</span></em> circles or circuits in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But with the
          Pagans—of whom Coleridge rightly says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Time, cyclical time, was their abstraction of the
          Deity,”</span> that <span class="tei tei-q">“Deity”</span>
          manifesting coördinately with, and only through, Karma, and being
          that Karma-Nemesis itself—the Cycles meant something more than a
          mere succession of events, or a periodical space of time of more or
          less prolonged duration. For they were generally marked with
          recurrences of a more varied and intellectual character than are
          exhibited in the periodical return of seasons or of certain
          constellations. Modern wisdom is satisfied with astronomical
          computations and prophecies, based on unerring mathematical laws.
          Ancient Wisdom added to the cold shell of Astronomy the vivifying
          elements of its soul and spirit—Astrology. And, as the sidereal
          motions <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">do</span></em> regulate and determine other
          events on Earth besides potatoes and the periodical diseases of
          that useful vegetable—a statement which, not being amenable to
          scientific explanation, is merely derided, while none the less
          accepted—these events have to submit to predetermination, by simple
          astronomical computations. Believers in Astrology will understand
          our meaning, sceptics will laugh at the belief and mock the idea.
          Thus they shut their eyes, ostrich-like, to their own fate.<a href="#note_1108" id="noteref_1108" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1108</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This because
          their little <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em> period, so called,
          allows them no margin for comparison. Sidereal heaven is before
          them; and though their spiritual vision is still unopened, and the
          atmospheric dust of terrestrial origin seals their sight and chains
          it within the limits of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page708">[pg
          708]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg708"></a>
          physical systems, still they do not fail to perceive the movements
          and note the behaviour of meteors and comets. They record the
          periodical advents of those wanderers and <span class="tei tei-q">“flaming messengers,”</span> and prophesy, in
          consequence, earthquakes, meteoric showers, the apparition of
          certain stars, comets, etc. Are they, then, soothsayers after all?
          No; they are learned Astronomers.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Why, then,
          should Occultists and Astrologers, as learned as these Astronomers,
          be disbelieved when they prophesy the return of some cyclic event
          on the same mathematical principles? Why should the claim that they
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">know</span></em> this return be ridiculed?
          Their forefathers and predecessors, having recorded the recurrence
          of such events in their time and day, throughout a period embracing
          hundreds of thousands of years, the conjunction of the same
          constellations must necessarily produce, if not quite the same, at
          any rate similar, effects. Are the prophecies to be derided,
          because of the claim made for hundreds of thousands of years of
          observation, and for millions of years for the human Races? In its
          turn, Modern Science is laughed at by those who hold to Biblical
          chronology, for its far more modest geological and anthropological
          figures. Thus Karma adjusts even human laughter, at the mutual
          expense of sects, learned societies, and individuals. Yet in the
          prognostication of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">such</span></em> future events, at any rate,
          all foretold on the authority of cyclic recurrences, no psychic
          phenomenon is involved. It is neither <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prevision</span></em>, nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophecy</span></em>; any more than is the
          signalling of a comet or star, several years before its appearance.
          It is simply knowledge, and mathematically correct computations,
          which enable the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Wise Men of the East</span></em> to foretell,
          for instance, that England is on the eve of such or another
          catastrophe; that France is nearing such a point of her Cycle; and
          that Europe in general is threatened with, or rather is on the eve
          of, a cataclysm, to which her own Cycle of racial Karma <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has led
          her</span></em>. Our view of the reliability of the information
          depends, of course, on our acceptation or rejection of the claim
          for a tremendous period of historical observation. Eastern
          Initiates maintain that they have preserved records of racial
          development and of events of universal import ever since the
          beginning of the Fourth Race—their knowledge of events preceding
          that epoch being traditional. Moreover, those who believe in
          Seership and in Occult Powers will have no difficulty in crediting
          the general character, at least, of the information given, even if
          it be traditional, once the tradition is checked and corrected by
          clairvoyance and Esoteric Knowledge. But <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page709">[pg 709]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg709"></a> in the present case no such metaphysical
          belief is claimed as our chief dependence, for proof is given—on
          what, to every Occultist, is quite scientific evidence—the records
          preserved through the Zodiac for incalculable ages.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is now amply
          proved that even horoscopes and judiciary Astrology are not quite
          based on fiction, and that Stars and Constellations, consequently,
          have an occult and mysterious influence on, and connection with,
          individuals. And if with the latter, why not with nations, races,
          and mankind as a whole? This, again, is a claim made on the
          authority of the Zodiacal records. We shall then enquire how far
          the Zodiac was known to the Ancients, and how far it is forgotten
          by the Moderns.</p>

          truly to adopt, than to beget, their opinions.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is doubly
          true in regard to scientific opinions upon hypotheses offered for
          consideration—the prejudice and preconceptions of <span class="tei tei-q">“authorities,”</span> so called, often deciding upon
          questions of the most vital importance for history. There are
          several such predetermined opinions held by our learned
          Orientalists, and few are more unjust or illogical than the general
          error with regard to the antiquity of the Zodiac. Thanks to the
          hobby of some German Orientalists, English and American
          Sanskritists have accepted Professor Weber's opinion that the
          peoples of India had no idea or knowledge of the Zodiac prior to
          the Macedonian invasion, and that it is from the Greeks that the
          ancient Hindûs imported it into their country. We are further told,
          by several other <span class="tei tei-q">“authorities,”</span> that
          no Eastern nation knew of the Zodiac before the Hellenes kindly
          acquainted their neighbours with their invention. And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>,
          in the face of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of Job</span></span>, which is declared,
          even by themselves, to be the oldest in the Hebrew canon, and
          certainly prior to Moses; a book which speaks of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">making</span></em>
          of <span class="tei tei-q">“Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades [Osh,

          words which, if they mean anything, imply knowledge of the Zodiac
          even among the nomadic Arabian tribes. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Book of
          Job</span></span> is alleged to have preceded Homer and Hesiod by
          at least one thousand years—the two Greek poets having themselves
          flourished some eight centuries before the Christian era (!!).
          Though, by the bye, one who prefers to believe <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page711">[pg 711]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg711"></a> Plato—who shows Homer flourishing far
          earlier—could point to a number of Zodiacal signs mentioned in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iliad</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Odyssey</span></span>, in the Orphic poems,
          and elsewhere. But since the cock-and-bull hypothesis of some
          modern critics that, so far from Orpheus, not even Homer or Hesiod
          has ever existed, it would seem time lost to mention these archaic
          authors at all. The Arabian Job will suffice; unless, indeed, his
          volume of lamentations, along with the poems of the two Greeks, to
          which we may add those of Linus, should now also be declared to be
          the patriotic forgery of the Jew Aristobulus. But if the Zodiac was
          known in the days of Job, how could the civilized and philosophical
          Hindûs have remained ignorant of it?</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Risking the
          arrows of modern criticism—rather blunted by misuse—the reader may
          make himself acquainted with Bailly's learned opinion upon the
          subject. Inferred speculations may be shown to be erroneous.
          Mathematical calculations stand on more secure grounds. Taking as a
          starting point several astronomical references in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Job</span></span>,
          Bailly devised a very ingenious means of proving that the earliest
          founders of the Science of the Zodiac belonged to an antediluvian,
          primitive people. The fact that he seems willing to see some of the
          Biblical patriarchs in Thoth, Seth, and in the Chinese Fohi, does
          not interfere with the validity of his proof as to the antiquity of
          the Zodiac.<a href="#note_1111" id="noteref_1111" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1111</span></span></a> Even
          accepting, for argument's sake, his cautious 3700 years
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> as the correct age of
          the Zodiacal Science, this date proves in the most irrefutable way
          that it was not the Greeks who invented the Zodiac, for the simple
          reason that they did not exist as a nation thirty-seven centuries
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>—at any rate not as a
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical</span></em> race admitted by the
          critics. Bailly then calculated the period at which the
          constellations manifested the atmospheric influence called by Job
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“sweet influences of the
          Pleiades,”</span><a href="#note_1112" id="noteref_1112" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1112</span></span></a> in
          Hebrew Kimah; that of Orion, Kesil; and that of the desert rains
          with reference to Scorpio, the eighth constellation; and found that
          in presence of the eternal conformity of these divisions of the
          Zodiac, and of the names of the Planets applied in the same order
          everywhere and always, and in presence of the impossibility of
          attributing it all to chance and <span class="tei tei-q">“coincidence”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“which
          never creates such similarities”</span>—a very great antiquity
          indeed must be allowed for the Zodiac.<a href="#note_1113" id="noteref_1113" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1113</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page712">[pg 712]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg712"></a>

          was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“Star,”</span> the Zodiac is referred to. The Roman
          Catholics have discovered in it, moreover, a prophecy of Christ,
          who is that twelfth Star, they say, and the others the eleven
          apostles; the absence of the twelfth being also regarded as a
          prophetic allusion to the treachery of Judas. The twelve sons of

          earlier than the Chaldæans. Mr. Proctor shows, in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Myths and Marvels of
          Astronomy</span></span>, that the ancient Astronomers had acquired
          a system of the most accurate Astronomy 2,400 years <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>; the Hindûs date
          their Kali Yuga from a great periodical conjunction of the Planets
          thirty-one centuries <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>; but, withal, it was
          the Greeks, belonging to the expedition of Alexander the Great, who
          were the instructors of the Âryan Hindûs in Astronomy!</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
          origin of the Zodiac is Âryan or Egyptian, it is still of an
          immense antiquity. Simplicius, in the sixth century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>, writes that he had
          always heard that the Egyptians had kept astronomical observations
          and records for a period of 630,000 years. This statement appears
          to frighten Mr. Gerald Massey, who remarks on it that:</p>

          Martianus Capella corroborates this by telling posterity that the

          the world; for they affirmed that there were eight several kinds of
          men, all being different in life and manners; and that Heaven had

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is as
          nearly as possible the calculation of the Esoteric Doctrine. For
          1,000,000 years are allowed for our present Root-Race (the Fifth),
          and about 850,000 years have passed since the submersion of the
          last large island—part of the continent of Atlantis—the Ruta of the
          Fourth Race, the Atlanteans; while Daitya, a small island inhabited
          by a mixed race, was destroyed about 270,000 years ago, during the
          Glacial Period or thereabouts. But the Seven Rulers, or the seven
          great Dynasties of the Divine Kings, belong to the traditions of
          every great people of antiquity. Wherever twelve are mentioned,
          they are invariably the twelve signs of the Zodiac.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So patent is
          this fact, that the Roman Catholic writers—especially among the
          French Ultramontanes—have tacitly agreed to connect the twelve
          Jewish Patriarchs with the Signs of the Zodiac. This is done in a
          kind of prophetico-mystic way, which sounds to pious and ignorant
          ears like a portentous token, a tacit divine recognition of the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“chosen people of God,”</span> whose finger
          has purposely traced in heaven, from the beginning of creation, the
          numbers of these patriarchs. For instance, curiously enough, these
          writers, De Mirville among others, recognize all the
          characteristics of the twelve Signs of the Zodiac, in the words
          addressed by the dying Jacob to his Sons, and in his definitions of
          the future of each Tribe.<a href="#note_1122" id="noteref_1122" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1122</span></span></a>
          Moreover, the respective banners of the same tribes are said to
          have exhibited the same symbols and the same names as the Signs,
          repeated in the twelve stones of the Urim and Thummim, and on the
          twelve wings of the two Cherubs. Leaving to the said Mystics the
          proof of exactitude in the alleged correspondence, we quote it as
          follows: Man, or Aquarius, is in the sphere of Reuben, who is
          declared as <span class="tei tei-q">“unstable as water”</span> (the
          Vulgate has it, <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rushing</span></em>
          like water”</span>); Gemini, in that of Simeon and Levi, because of
          their strong fraternal association; Leo, in that of Judah,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the strong Lion”</span> of his tribe,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the lion's whelp”</span>; Pisces, in
          Zabulon, who <span class="tei tei-q">“shall dwell at the haven of
          the sea”</span>; Taurus, in Issachar, because he is <span class="tei tei-q">“a strong ass couching down,”</span> etc., and
          therefore associated with the stables; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page715">[pg 715]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg715"></a> (Virgo-) Scorpio, in Dan, who is described as
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a serpent, an adder in the path that
          biteth,”</span> etc.; Capricornus in Naphtali, who is <span class="tei tei-q">“a hind (a deer) let loose”</span>; Cancer, in
          Benjamin, for he is <span class="tei tei-q">“ravenous”</span>;
          Libra, the Balance, in Asher, whose <span class="tei tei-q">“bread
          shall be fat”</span>; Sagittarius in Joseph, because <span class="tei tei-q">“his bow abode in strength.”</span> To make up for the
          twelfth Sign, Virgo, made independent of Scorpio, we have Dinah,
          the only daughter of Jacob. Tradition shows the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alleged</span></em>
          tribes carrying the twelve signs on their banners. But indeed the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>, in addition to the above,
          is filled with theo-cosmological and astronomical symbols and
          personifications.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It remains to
          wonder, and to query—if the actual, living Patriarchs' destiny was
          so indissolubly wound up with the Zodiac—how it is that, after the
          loss of the ten tribes, the ten signs also out of the twelve have
          not miraculously disappeared from the sidereal fields? But this is
          of no great concern. Let us rather busy ourselves with the history
          of the Zodiac itself.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader may
          be reminded of some opinions expressed as to the Zodiac by several
          of the highest authorities in Science.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Newton believed
          that the invention of the Zodiac could be traced as far back as the
          expedition of the Argonauts; and Dulaure fixed its origin at 6,500
          years <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, just 2,496 years
          before the creation of the world, according to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>
          chronology.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Creuzer thought
          that it was very easy to show that most of the Theogonies were
          intimately connected with religious calendars, and were related to
          the Zodiac as to their prime origin; if not to the Zodiac known to
          us now, then to something very analogous with it. He felt certain
          that the Zodiac and its mystic relations are at the bottom of all
          the mythologies, under one form or another, and that it had existed
          in the old form for ages, before it was brought out in the present
          defined astronomical garb, owing to some singular coördination of
          events.<a href="#note_1123" id="noteref_1123" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1123</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No Occultist, no

          symbol of an eternal law, decreed for the actual Manvantara. Why
          see in Pisces a direct reference to Christ—one of the several
          world-reformers, a Saviour for his direct followers, but only a
          great and glorious Initiate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page717">[pg 717]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg717"></a> for all the rest—when that constellation
          shines as a symbol of all the past, present, and future Spiritual
          Saviours, who dispense light and dispel mental darkness? Christian
          symbologists have tried to prove that this sign belonged to
          Ephraim, Joseph's son, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elect</span></em> of Jacob, and that
          therefore, it was at the moment of the Sun's entering into the sign
          of Pisces, the Fish, that the <span class="tei tei-q">“Elect
          Messiah,”</span> the Ἰχθὺς of the first Christians, had to be born.
          But if Jesus of Nazareth was that Messiah, was he really born at
          that <span class="tei tei-q">“moment,”</span> or was his birth-hour
          thus fixed by the adaptation of Theologians, who sought only to
          make their preconceived ideas fit in with sidereal facts and
          popular belief? Everyone is aware that the real time and year of
          the birth of Jesus are totally unknown. And it is the Jews—whose

          rabbinical language—who are the first to deny this Christian claim.
          And what of the further facts that Brâhmans connect their
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Messiah,”</span> the eternal Avatâra
          Vishnu, with a Fish and the Deluge, and that the Babylonians also

          a rage, at the beginning of the present century, for claiming
          restoration from the Hindûs for an alleged robbery from the Jews of
          their <span class="tei tei-q">“Gods,”</span> patriarchs, and
          chronology. It was Wilford who recognized Noah in Prithî and in
          Satyavrata, Enos in Dhruva, and even Assur in Îshvara. After being
          residents for so many years in India, some Orientalists, at least,
          ought to have known that it was not the Brâhmans alone who had
          these figures, or who had divided their Great Age into four minor
          ages. Nevertheless writers in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Asiatic
          Researches</span></span> indulged in the most extravagant

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is intended
          to apply to Captain (later Colonel) Wilford, but the words may fit
          more than one of our modern Orientalists. Colonel Wilford was the
          first to crown his unlucky speculations on Hindû chronology and the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purânas</span></span> by connecting the
          4,320,000 years with biblical chronology, by simply dwarfing the
          figures to 4,320 years—the supposed lunar year of the Nativity—and
          Dr. Sepp has simply plagiarized the idea from this gallant officer.
          Moreover, he persisted in seeing in them Jewish property, as well
          as Christian prophecy, thus accusing the Âryans of having helped
          themselves to Semitic revelation, whereas the reverse was the case.
          The Jews, moreover, need not be accused of directly despoiling the
          Hindûs, of whose figures Ezra probably knew nothing. They had
          evidently and undeniably borrowed them from the Chaldeans, along
          with the Chaldean Gods. They turned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page719">[pg 719]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg719"></a> the 432,000 years of the Chaldean Divine
          Dynasties<a href="#note_1132" id="noteref_1132" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1132</span></span></a> into
          4,320 lunar years from the world's creation to the Christian era;
          as to the Babylonian and Egyptian Gods, they quietly and modestly
          transformed them into Patriarchs. Every nation was more or less
          guilty of such refashioning and adaptation of a Pantheon—once
          common to all—of universal into national and tribal Gods and
          Heroes. It was Jewish property in its new Pentateuchal garb, and no
          one of the Israelites has ever forced it upon any other
          nation—least of all upon the European.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without stopping
          to notice this very unscientific chronology more than is necessary,
          we may yet make a few remarks that may be found to the point. The
          4,320 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lunar</span></em> years of the world—in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solar</span></em>
          years are used—are not fanciful, as such, even if their application
          is quite erroneous; for they are only the distorted echo of the
          primitive Esoteric, and later of the Brâhmanical doctrine
          concerning the Yugas. A Day of Brahmâ equals 4,320,000,000 years,
          as also does a Night of Brahmâ, or the duration of Pralaya, after
          which a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">“sun”</span> rises triumphantly over a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new</span></em>
          Manvantara, for the Septenary Chain it illuminates. The teaching
          had penetrated into Palestine and Europe centuries before the
          Christian era,<a href="#note_1133" id="noteref_1133" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1133</span></span></a> and
          was present in the minds of the Mosaic Jews, who based upon it
          their small Cycle, though it received full expression only through
          the Christian chronologers of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>,
          who adopted it, as also the 25th of December, the day on which all
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solar</span></em> Gods were said to have been
          incarnated. What wonder, then, that the Messiah was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">made</span></em> to
          be born in <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lunar</span></em>
          year of the world 4,320”</span>? The <span class="tei tei-q">“Sun
          of Righteousness and Salvation”</span> had once more arisen and had
          dispelled the pralayic darkness of Chaos and Nonbeing on the plane
          of our objective little Globe and Chain. Once the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page720">[pg 720]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg720"></a> subject of the adoration was settled
          upon, it was easy to make the supposed events of his birth, life,
          and death, fit in with the Zodiacal exigencies and the old
          traditions, though they had to be somewhat remodelled for the
          occasion.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus what Kepler
          said, as a great Astronomer, becomes comprehensible. He recognized
          the grand and universal importance of all such planetary
          conjunctions, <span class="tei tei-q">“each of which”</span>—as he
          has well said—<span class="tei tei-q">“is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">climacteric</span></em> year of
          Humanity.”</span><a href="#note_1134" id="noteref_1134" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1134</span></span></a> The
          rare conjunction of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars has its significance
          and importance on account of its certain great results, in India
          and China as much as it has in Europe, for the respective Mystics
          of these countries. And it is certainly now no better than a mere
          assumption to maintain that Nature had only Christ in view, in
          building her (to the profane) fantastic and meaningless
          constellations. If it is claimed that it was no hazard that could
          lead the archaic architects of the Zodiac, thousands of years ago,
          to mark the figure of Taurus with the asterisk <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>, with
          no better or more valid proof of it being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prophetic</span></em> of the Verbum or Christ
          than that the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aleph</span></span> of Taurus means the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“one”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“first,”</span> and that Christ was also the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span></span> or the <span class="tei tei-q">“one,”</span> then this <span class="tei tei-q">“proof”</span> may be shown to be strangely invalidated
          in more than one way. To begin with, the Zodiac existed before the
          Christian era, at all events; further, all the Sun-Gods—Osiris, for
          instance—had been mystically connected with the constellation
          Taurus and were all called by their respective votaries the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“First.”</span> Further, the compilers of
          the mystical epithets given to the Christian Saviour were all more
          or less acquainted with the significance of the Zodiacal signs; and
          it is easier to suppose that they should have arranged their claims
          so as to match the mystic signs, than that the latter should have
          shone as a prophecy for one portion of humanity, for millions of
          years, taking no heed of the numberless generations that had gone
          before, and of those that were to be born hereafter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this
          theological assumption there are several answers. Firstly, the
          ansated Egyptian cross, or Tau, the Jaina cross, or Svastika, and
          the Christian cross, have all the same meaning. Secondly, no
          peoples or nations except the Christians gave the significance to
          the Dragon that is given to it now. The Serpent was the symbol of
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Wisdom</span></span>; and the Bull,
          Taurus, the symbol of physical or terrestrial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generation</span></em>. Thus the Bull, pushing
          off the Dragon, or spiritual Divine Wisdom, with the Tau, or
          Cross—which is esoterically <span class="tei tei-q">“the foundation
          and framework of all construction”</span>—would have an entirely
          phallic, physiological meaning, had it not had yet another
          significance unknown to our Biblical scholars and symbologists. At
          any rate, it has no special reference to the Verbum of St. John,
          except, perhaps, in a general sense. The Taurus—which, by the way,
          is no lamb, but a bull—was sacred in every Cosmogony, with the
          Hindûs as with the Zoroastrians, with the Chaldees as with the
          Egyptians. So much, every schoolboy knows.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may perhaps
          help to refresh the memory of our Theosophists if we refer them to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1853, the
          savant known as Erard-Mollien read before the Institute of France a
          paper tending to prove the antiquity of the Indian Zodiac, in the
          signs of which were found the root and philosophy of all the most
          important religious festivals of that country; the lecturer tried
          to demonstrate that the origin of these religious ceremonies goes
          back into the night of time to at least 3,000 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The Zodiac of the
          Hindûs, he thought, was long anterior to the Zodiac of the Greeks,
          and differed from it much in some particulars. In it one sees the
          Dragon on a Tree, at the foot of which the Virgin, Kanyâ-Durgâ, one
          of the most ancient Goddesses, is placed on a Lion dragging after
          it the solar car. He said:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The astronomers who preceded the epoch 1491 are,
          first, the Alexandrian Greeks; Hipparchus, who flourished 125 years
          before our era, and Ptolemy, 260 years after Hipparchus. Following
          these were the Arabs, who revived the study of astronomy in the
          ninth century. These were succeeded by the Persians and the
          Tartars, to whom we owe the tables of Nassireddin in 1269, and
          those of Ulug-beg in 1437. Such is the succession of events in Asia
          as known prior to the Indian epoch 1491. What, then, is an epoch?
          It is the observation of the longitude of a star at a given moment,
          the place in the sky where it was seen, and which serves as a point
          of reference, a starting-point from which to calculate both the
          past and future positions of the star from its observed motion. But
          an epoch is useless unless the motion of the star has been
          determined. A people, new to science and obliged to borrow a
          foreign astronomy, finds no difficulty in fixing an epoch, since
          the only observation needed is one which can be made at any moment.
          But what it needs above all, what it is obliged to borrow, are
          those elements which depend on accurate determination, and which
          require continuous observation; above all, those motions which
          depend on time, and which can only be accurately determined by
          centuries of observation. These motions, then, must be borrowed
          from a nation which has made such observations, and has behind it
          the labours of centuries. We conclude,</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page723">[pg 723]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg723"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">therefore, that a new people will not borrow the
            epochs of an ancient one, without also borrowing from them
            the</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">average
            motions.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">Starting from this principle we
            shall find that the Hindû epochs 1491 and 3102 could not have
            been derived from those of either Ptolemy or Ulug-beg.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">There remains the supposition that the Hindûs,
            comparing their observations in 1491 with those previously made
            by Ulug-beg and Ptolemy, used the intervals between these
            observations to determine the average motions. The date of
            Ulug-beg is too recent for such a determination; while those of
            Ptolemy and Hipparchus were barely remote enough. But if the
            Hindû motions had been determined from these comparisons, the
            epochs would be connected together. Starting from the epochs of
            Ulug-beg and Ptolemy we should arrive at all those of the Hindûs.
            Hence foreign epochs were either unknown or useless to the
            Hindûs.</span><a href="#note_1140" id="noteref_1140" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1140</span></span></a></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">We may add to this another important
            consideration. When a nation is obliged to borrow from its
            neighbours the methods or the average motions of its astronomical
            tables, it has even greater need to borrow, besides these, the
            knowledge of the inequalities of the motions of the heavenly
            bodies, the motions of the apogee, of the nodes, and of the
            inclination of the ecliptic; in short, all those elements the
            determination of which requires the art of observing, some
            instrumental appliances, and great industry. All these
            astronomical elements, differing more or less with the Greeks of
            Alexandria, the Arabs, the Persians and the Tartars, exhibit no
            resemblance whatever with those of the Hindûs. The latter,
            therefore, borrowed nothing from their neighbours.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">If the Hindûs did not borrow their epoch, they
            must have possessed a real one of their own, based on their own
            observations; and this must be either the epoch of the year 1491
            after, or that of the year 3102 before our era, the latter
            preceding by 4,592 years the epoch 1491. We have to choose
            between these two epochs and to decide which of them is based on
            observation. But before stating the arguments which can and must
            decide the question, we may be permitted to make a few remarks to
            those who may be inclined to believe that it is modern
            observations and calculations which have enabled the Hindûs to
            determine the past positions of the heavenly bodies. It is far
            from easy to determine the celestial movements with sufficient
            accuracy to ascend the stream of time for 4,592 years, and to
            describe the phenomena which must have occurred at that period.
            We possess to-day excellent instruments; exact observations have
            been made for some two or three centuries, which already permit
            us to calculate with considerable accuracy the average motions of
            the Planets; we have the observations of the Chaldeans, of
            Hipparchus and of Ptolemy, which, owing to their remoteness from
            the present time, permit us to fix these motions with greater
            certainty. Still we cannot undertake to represent with invariable
            accuracy the observations throughout the long period intervening
            between the Chaldeans and ourselves; and still less can we
            undertake to determine with exactitude events occurring 4,592
            years before our day. Cassini and Maier have each determined the
            secular motion of the moon, and they differ by 3m. 43s. This
            difference would give rise in forty-six centuries to an
            uncertainty</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page724">[pg
            724]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg724"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">of nearly three
            degrees in the moon's place. Doubtless one of these
            determinations is more accurate than the other; and it is for
            observations of very great antiquity to decide between them. But
            in very remote periods, where observations are lacking, it
            follows that we are uncertain as to the phenomena. How, then,
            could the Hindûs have calculated back from the year 1491</span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 90%; font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">to the year 3102 before our era, if
            they were only recent students of Astronomy?</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">The Orientals have never been what we are.
            However high an opinion of their knowledge we may form from the
            examination of their Astronomy, we cannot suppose them ever to
            have possessed that great array of instruments which
            distinguishes our modern observatories, and which is the product
            of simultaneous progress in various arts, nor could they have
            possessed that genius for discovery, which has hitherto seemed to
            belong exclusively to Europe, and which, supplying the place of
            time, causes the rapid progress of science and of human
            intelligence. If the Asiatics have been powerful, learned and
            wise, it is power and time which have produced their merit and
            success of all kinds. Power has founded or destroyed their
            empires; now it has erected edifices imposing by their bulk, now
            it has reduced them to venerable ruins; and while these
            vicissitudes alternated with each other, patience accumulated
            knowledge; and prolonged experience produced wisdom. It is the
            antiquity of the nations of the East which has erected their
            scientific fame.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">If the Hindûs possessed in 1491 a knowledge of
            the heavenly motions sufficiently accurate to enable them to
            calculate backwards for 4592 years, it follows that they could
            only have obtained this knowledge from very ancient observations.
            To grant them such knowledge, while refusing them the
            observations from which it is derived, is to suppose an
            impossibility; it would be equivalent to assuming that at the
            outset of their career they had already reaped the harvest of
            time and experience. While on the other hand, if their epoch of
            3102 is assumed to be real, it would follow that the Hindûs had
            simply kept pace with successive centuries down to the year 1491
            of our era. Thus, time itself was their teacher; they knew the
            motions of the heavenly bodies during these periods, because they
            had seen them; and the duration of the Hindû people on earth is
            the cause of the fidelity of its records and the accuracy of its
            calculations.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It would seem that the problem as to which of
            the two epochs of 3102 and 1491 is the real one ought to be
            solved by one consideration, viz., that the ancients in general,
            and particularly the Hindûs, as we may see by the arrangement of
            their Tables, calculated, and therefore observed, eclipses only.
            Now, there was no eclipse of the sun at the moment of the epoch
            1491; and no eclipse of the moon either fourteen days before or
            after that moment. Therefore the epoch 1491 is not based on an
            observation. As regards the epoch 3102, the Brâhmans of Tirvaloor
            place it at sunrise on February 18th. The sun was then in the
            first point of the Zodiac according to its true longitude. The
            other Tables show that at the preceding midnight the moon was in
            the same place, but according to its average longitude. The
            Brâhmans tell us also that this first point, the origin of their
            Zodiac, was, in the year 3102, 54 degrees behind the equinox. It
            follows that the origin—the first point of their Zodiac—was
            therefore in the sixth degree of Aquarius.</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page725">[pg 725]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg725"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">There occurred, therefore, about this time and
            place an average conjunction; and indeed this conjunction is
            given in our best Tables: La Caille's for the sun and Maier's for
            the moon. There was no eclipse of the sun, the moon being too
            distant from her node; but fourteen days later, the moon having
            approached the node, must have been eclipsed. Maier's tables,
            used without correction for acceleration, give this eclipse; but
            they place it during the day when it could not have been observed
            in India. Cassini's tables give it as occurring at night, which
            shows that Maier's motions are too rapid for distant centuries,
            when the acceleration is not allowed for; and which also proves
            that in spite of the improvement of our knowledge we can still be
            uncertain as to the actual aspect of the heavens in past
            times.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Therefore we believe that, as between the two
            Hindû epochs, the real one is the year 3102, because it was
            accompanied by an eclipse which could be observed, and which must
            have served to determine it. This is a first proof of the truth
            of the longitude assigned by the Hindûs to the sun and the moon
            at this instant; and this proof would perhaps be sufficient, were
            it not that this ancient determination becomes of the greatest
            importance for the verification of the motions of these bodies,
            and must therefore be borne out by every possible proof of its
            authenticity.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">We notice, 1st, that the Hindûs seem to have
            combined two epochs together into the year 3102. The Tirvaloor
            Brâhmans reckon primarily from the first moment of the Kali Yuga;
            but they have a second epoch placed 2d. 3h. 32m. 30s. later. The
            latter is the true astronomical epoch, while the former seems to
            be a civil era. But if this epoch of the Kali Yuga had no
            reality, and was the mere result of a calculation, why should it
            be thus divided? Their calculated astronomical epoch would have
            become that of the Kali Yuga, which would have been placed at the
            conjunction of the sun and the moon, as is the case with the
            epochs of the three other Tables. They must have had some reason
            for distinguishing between the two; and this reason can only be
            due to the circumstances and the time of the epoch; which
            therefore could not be the result of calculation. This is not
            all; starting from the solar epoch determined by the rising of
            the sun on February 18th, 3102, and tracing back events 2d. 3h.
            32m. 30s., we come to 2h. 27m. 30s. a.m. of February 16th, which
            is the instant of the beginning of Kali Yuga. It is curious that
            this age has not been made to commence at one of the four great
            divisions of the day. It might be suspected that the epoch should
            be midnight, and that the 2h. 27m. 30s. are a meridian
            correction. But whatever may have been the reason for fixing on
            this moment, it is plain that were this epoch the result of
            calculation, it would have been just as easy to carry it back to
            midnight, so as to make the epoch correspond to one of the chief
            divisions of the day, instead of placing it at a moment fixed by
            the fraction of a day.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">2nd. The Hindûs assert that at the first moment
            of Kali Yuga there was a conjunction of all the planets; and
            their Tables show this conjunction while ours indicate that it
            might actually have occurred. Jupiter and Mercury were in exactly
            the same degree of the ecliptic; Mars being 8° and Saturn 17°
            distant from it. It follows that about this time, or some fifteen
            days after the commencement of Kali Yuga, and as the sun advanced
            in the Zodiac, the Hindûs saw four planets emerge successively
            from the Sun's rays; first Saturn, then Mars, then</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page726">[pg 726]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg726"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">Jupiter and Mercury, and these planets appeared
            united in a somewhat small space. Although Venus was not among
            them, the taste for the marvellous caused it to be called a
            general conjunction of all the planets. The testimony of the
            Brâhmans here coïncides with that of our Tables; and this
            evidence, the result of a tradition, must be founded on actual
            observation.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">3rd. We may remark that this phenomenon was
            visible about a fortnight after the epoch, and exactly at the
            time when the eclipse of the moon must have been observed, which
            served to fix the epoch. The two observations mutually confirm
            each other; and whoever made the one must have made the other
            also.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">4th. We may believe also that the Hindûs made at
            the same time a determination of the place of the moon's node;
            this seems indicated by their calculation. They give the
            longitude of this point of the lunar orbit for the time of their
            epoch, and to this they add as a constant 40m., which is the
            node's motion in 12d. 14h. It is as if they stated that this
            determination was made thirteen days after their epoch, and that
            to make it correspond to that epoch, we must add the 40m. through
            which the node has retrograded in the interval. This observation
            is, therefore, of the same date as that of the lunar eclipse;
            thus giving three observations, which are mutually
            confirmatory.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">5th. It appears from the description of the
            Hindû Zodiac given by M. C. Gentil, that on it the places of the
            stars named the Eye of Taurus and the Wheat-ear of Virgo, can be
            determined for the commencement of the Kali Yuga. Now, comparing
            these places with the actual positions, reduced by our precession
            of the equinoxes to the moment in question, we see that the point
            of origin of the Hindû Zodiac must lie between the fifth and
            sixth degree of Aquarius. The Brâhmans, therefore, were right in
            placing it in the sixth degree of that sign, the more so since
            this small difference may be due to the proper motion of the
            stars, which is unknown. Thus it was yet another observation
            which guided the Hindûs in this fairly accurate determination of
            the first point of their movable Zodiac.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It does not seem possible to doubt the existence
            in antiquity of observations of this date. The Persians say that
            four beautiful stars were placed as guardians at the four corners
            of the world. Now it so happens that at the commencement of Kali
            Yuga, 3,000 or 3,100 years before our era, the Eye of the Bull
            and the Heart of the Scorpion were exactly at the equinoctial
            points, while the Heart of the Lion and the Southern Fish were
            pretty near the solstitial points. An observation of the rising
            of the Pleiades in the evening, seven days before the autumnal
            equinox, also belongs to the year 3000 before our era. This and
            similar observations are collected in Ptolemy's calendars, though
            he does not give their authors; and these, which are older than
            those of the Chaldeans, may well be the work of the Hindûs. They
            are well acquainted with the constellation of the Pleiades, and
            while we call it vulgarly the</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Poussinière,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">they name it Pillaloo-codi—the</span>

            chickens.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
<span style="font-size: 90%">This name has, therefore, passed
            from people to people, and comes to us from the most ancient
            nations of Asia. We see that the Hindûs must have observed the
            rising of the Pleiades, and have made use of it to regulate their
            years and their months; for this constellation is also called
            Krittikâ. Now they have a month of the same name, and this
            coïncidence can only be due to the</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page727">[pg 727]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg727"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">fact that this month was announced by the rising
            or setting of the constellation in question.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">But what is even more decisive as showing that
            the Hindûs observed the stars, and in the same way that we do,
            marking their position by their longitude, is a fact mentioned by
            Augustinus Riccius that, according to observations attributed to
            Hermes, and made 1,985 years before Ptolemy, the brilliant star
            in the Lyre and that in the heart of the Hydra were each seven
            degrees in advance of their respective positions as determined by
            Ptolemy. This determination seems very extraordinary. The stars
            advance regularly with respect to the equinox: and Ptolemy ought
            to have found the longitudes 28 degrees in excess of what they
            were 1,985 years before his time. Besides, there is a remarkable
            peculiarity about this fact, the same error or difference being
            found in the positions of both stars; therefore the error was due
            to some cause affecting both stars equally. It was to explain
            this peculiarity that the Arab Thebith imagined the stars to have
            an oscillatory movement, causing them to advance and recede
            alternately. This hypothesis was easily disproved; but the
            observations attributed to Hermes remained unexplained. Their
            explanation, however, is found in Hindû Astronomy. At the date
            fixed for these observations, 1,985 years before Ptolemy, the
            first point of the Hindû Zodiac was 35 degrees in advance of the
            equinox; therefore the longitudes reckoned for this point are 35
            degrees in excess of those reckoned from the equinox. But after
            the lapse of 1,985 years the stars would have advanced 28
            degrees, and there would remain a difference of only 7 degrees
            between the longitudes of Hermes and those of Ptolemy, and the
            difference would be the same for the two stars, since it is due
            to the difference between the starting-points of the Hindû Zodiac
            and that of Ptolemy, which reckons from the equinox. This
            explanation is so simple and natural that it must be true. We do
            not know whether Hermes, so celebrated in antiquity, was a Hindû,
            but we see that the observations attributed to him are reckoned
            in the Hindû manner, and we conclude that they were made by the
            Hindûs, who, therefore, were able to make all the observations we
            have enumerated, and which we find noted in their
            Tables.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">6th. The observation of the year 3102, which
            seems to have fixed their epoch, was not a difficult one. We see
            that the Hindûs, having once determined the moon's daily motion
            of 13° 10´ 35´´, made use of it to divide the Zodiac into 27
            constellations, related to the period of the moon, which takes
            about 27 days to describe it.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">It was by this method that they determined the
            positions of the stars in this Zodiac; it was thus they found
            that a certain star of the Lyre was in 8s 24°, the Heart of the
            Hydra in 4s 7°, longitudes which are ascribed to Hermes, but
            which are calculated on the Hindû Zodiac. Similarly, they
            discovered that the Wheat-ear of Virgo forms the commencement of
            their fifteenth constellation, and the Eye of Taurus the end of
            the fourth; these stars being the one in 6s 6° 40´, the other in
            1s 23° 20´ of the Hindû Zodiac. This being so, the eclipse of the
            moon which occurred fifteen days after the Kali Yuga epoch, took
            place at a point between the Wheat-ear of Virgo and the star θ of
            the same constellation. These stars are very approximately a
            constellation apart, the one beginning the fifteenth, the other
            the sixteenth. Thus it would not be difficult to determine the
            moon's place by</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page728">[pg
            728]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg728"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">measuring her
            distance from one of these stars; from this they deduced the
            position of the sun, which is opposite to the moon, and then,
            knowing their average motions, they calculated that the moon was
            at the first point of the Zodiac according to her average
            longitude at midnight on the 17th-18th February of the year 3102
            before our era, and that the sun occupied the same place six
            hours later according to his true longitude; an event which fixes
            the commencement of the Hindû year.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">7th. The Hindûs state that 20,400 years before
            the age of Kali Yuga, the first point of their Zodiac coincided
            with the vernal equinox, and that the sun and moon were in
            conjunction there. This epoch is obviously
            fictitious;</span><a href="#note_1141" id="noteref_1141" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1141</span></span></a>
<span style="font-size: 90%">but we may enquire from what point,
            from what epoch, the Hindûs set out in establishing it. Taking
            the Hindû values for the revolution of the sun and moon, viz.,
            363d. 6h. 12m. 30s., and 27d. 7h. 43m. 13s., we have—</span></p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">Such is the result obtained by starting from the
            Kali Yuga epoch; and the assertion of the Hindûs, that there was
            a conjunction at the time stated, is founded on their Tables; but
            if, using the same elements, we start from the era of the year
            1491, or from another placed in the year 1282, of which we shall
            speak later, there will always be a difference of almost one or
            two days. It is both just and natural, in verifying the Hindû
            calculations, to take those among their elements which give the
            same result as they had themselves arrived at, and to set out
            from that one among their epochs which enables us to arrive at
            the fictitious epoch in question. Hence, since to make this
            calculation they must have set out from their real epoch, the one
            which was founded on an observation and not from any of those
            which were derived by this very calculation from the former, it
            follows that their real epoch was that of the year 3102 before
            our era.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">8th. The Tirvaloor Brâhmans give the moon's
            motion as 7s 20° 0´ 7´´ on the movable Zodiac, and as 9k 7° 45´
            1´´ as referred to the equinox in a great period of 1,600,984
            days, or 4,386 years and 94 days. We believe this motion to have
            been determined by observation; and we must state at the outset
            that this period is of an extent which renders it but ill suited
            to the calculation of the mean motions.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">In their astronomical calculations the Hindûs
            make use of periods of 248, 3,031, and 12,372 days; but, apart
            from the fact that these periods, though much too short, do not
            present the inconvenience of the former, they contain an exact
            number of revolutions of the moon referred to its apogee. They
            are in reality mean motions. The great period of 1,600,984 days
            is not a sum of accumulated revolutions; there is no reason why
            it should contain 1,600,984 rather than 1,600,985 days. It would
            seem that observation alone must have fixed the number of days
            and marked the beginning and end of the period. This period ends
            on the 21st of May, 1282 of our era, at 5h. 15m. 30s. at Benares.

            Brâhmans thus differs only by nine minutes from ours, and that of
            the apogee by twenty-two minutes, and it is very evident that
            they could only have obtained this agreement with our best Tables
            and this exactitude in the celestial positions by observation. If
            then, observation fixed the end of this period, there is every
            reason to believe that it determined its commencement. But then
            this motion, determined directly, and from nature, would of
            necessity be in close agreement with the true motions of the
            heavenly bodies.</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style="font-size: 90%">And in fact the Hindû motion during this long
            period of 4,883 years, does not differ by a minute from that of
            Cassini, and agrees equally with that of Maier. Thus two peoples,
            the Hindûs and the Europeans, placed at the two extremities of
            the world, and perhaps as distant by their institutions, have
            obtained precisely the same results as regards the moon's
            motions; and an agreement which would be inconceivable, if it
            were not based on the observation and mutual imitation of nature.
            We must remark that the four Tables of the Hindûs are all copies
            of the same Astronomy. It cannot be denied that the Siamese
            Tables existed in 1687, when they were brought from India by M.
            de la Loubère. At that time the tables of Cassini and Maier were
            not in existence, and thus the Hindûs were already in possession
            of the exact motion contained in these Tables, while we did not
            yet possess it. It must, therefore, be admitted that the accuracy
            of this Hindû motion is the point of observation. It is exact
            throughout this period of 4,383 years, because it was taken from
            the sky itself; and if observation determined its close, it fixed
            its commencement also. It is the longest period which has been
            observed and of which the recollection is preserved in the annals
            of Astronomy. It has its</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page730">[pg 730]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg730"></a><span style="font-size: 90%">origin in the

          them, better even than those which are called visible.... There are
          then Gods, superior to all appearances; after them come the Gods
          whose principle is spiritual; these Gods being sensible, in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, indeed,
          must be so, since the Esoteric Teachings in Egypt and India were
          identical. And, therefore, the personification of Fohat,
          synthesizing all the manifesting Forces in Nature is a legitimate
          result. Moreover, as will be shown later, the real and Occult
          Forces in Nature only now begin to be known—and even in this case,
          by heterodox, not orthodox, Science,<a href="#note_1151" id="noteref_1151" class="pginternal"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1151</span></span></a>
          though their existence, in one instance at any rate, is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The statement,
          moreover, in Stanza VI—that Fohat sets in motion the primordial
          World-Germs, or the aggregation of Cosmic Atoms and Matter,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“some one way, some the other way,”</span>
          in the opposite direction—looks orthodox and scientific enough. For
          there is, at all events, in support of this position, one fact
          fully recognized by Science, and it is this. The meteoric showers,
          periodical in November and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page736">[pg 736]</span><a class="tei tei-anchor" id="Pg736"></a> August, belong to a system moving in an
          elliptical orbit around the Sun. The aphelion of this ring is 1,732
          millions of miles beyond the orbit of Neptune, its plane is
          inclined to the Earth's orbit at an angle of 64° 3´, and the
          direction of the meteoric swarm moving round this orbit <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is contrary to that
          of the Earth's revolution</span></em>.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This fact,
          recognized only in 1833, shows it to be the modern rediscovery of
          what was very anciently known. Fohat turns with his two hands in
          contrary directions the <span class="tei tei-q">“seed”</span> and
          the <span class="tei tei-q">“curds,”</span> or Cosmic Matter; in
          clearer language, is turning particles in a highly attenuated
          condition, and nebulæ.</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Outside the
          boundaries of the Solar System, it is other Suns, and especially
          the mysterious Central Sun—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Abode of
          the Invisible Deity”</span> as some reverend gentlemen have called
          it—that determines the motion and the direction of bodies. That
          motion serves also to differentiate the homogeneous Matter, round
          and between the several bodies, into Elements and Sub-elements
          unknown to our Earth, and these are regarded by Modern Science as
          distinct individual Elements, whereas they are merely temporary
          appearances, changing with every small cycle within the Manvantara,
          some Esoteric works calling them <span class="tei tei-q">“Kalpic
          Masks.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fohat is the key
          in Occultism which opens and unriddles the multiform symbols and
          allegories in the so-called mythology of every nation;
          demonstrating the wonderful Philosophy and the deep insight into
          the mysteries of Nature, contained in the Egyptian and Chaldean as
          well as in the Âryan religions. Fohat, shown in his true character,
          proves how deeply versed were all those prehistoric nations in
          every Science of Nature, now called the physical and chemical
          branches of Natural Philosophy. In India, Fohat is the scientific
          aspect of both Vishnu and Indra, the latter older and more
          important in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Rig Veda</span></span> than his sectarian

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">It is hardly necessary to remind the
          reader that the term Divine Thought, like that of Universal Mind,
          must not be regarded as even vaguely shadowing forth an
          intellectual process akin to that exhibited by man. The
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Unconscious,”</span> according to von
          Hartmann, arrived at the vast creative, or rather evolutionary
          plan, <span class="tei tei-q">“by a clairvoyant wisdom superior to
          all consciousness,”</span> which in Vedântic language would mean
          absolute Wisdom. Only those who realize how far intuition soars
          above the tardy processes of ratiocinative thought can form the
          faintest conception of that absolute Wisdom which transcends the
          ideas of Time and Space. Mind, as we know it, is resolvable into
          states of consciousness, of varying duration, intensity,
          complexity, etc., all, in the ultimate, resting on sensation, which
          is again Mâyâ. Sensation, again, necessarily postulates limitation.
          The Personal God of orthodox Theism perceives, thinks, and is
          affected by emotion; he repents and feels <span class="tei tei-q">“fierce anger.”</span> But the notion of such mental
          states clearly involves the unthinkable postulate of the
          externality of the exciting stimuli, to say nothing of the
          impossibility of ascribing changelessness to a being whose emotions
          fluctuate with events in the worlds he presides over. The
          conceptions of a Personal God as changeless and infinite are thus
          unpsychological and, what is worse, unphilosophical.</dd>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">A Vedântin of the Visishthadvaita
          Philosophy would say that, though the only independent Reality,
          Parabrahman is inseparable from His Trinity. That He is three,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Parabrahman, Chit, and Achit,”</span> the
          last two being dependent Realities unable to exist separately; or,
          to make it clearer, Parabrahman is the Substance—changeless,
          eternal, and incognizable—and Chit (Âtmâ) and Achit (Anâtmâ) and
          its qualities, as form and colour are the qualities of any object.
          The two are the garment, or body, or rather aspect (sharîra) of
          Parabrahman. But an Occultist would find much to say against this
          claim, and so would the Advaiti Vedântin.</dd>

          of the rotation of the earth about an axis was taught by the
          Pythagorean Hicetas, probably as early as 500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It was also taught by
          his pupil Ecphantus, and by Heraclides, a pupil of Plato. The
          immobility of the sun and the orbital rotation of the earth were
          shown by Aristarchus of Samos as early as 281 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> to be suppositions
          accordant with facts of observation. The heliocentric theory was
          also taught about 150 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, by Seleucus of
          Seleucia on the Tigris. [It was taught 500 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> by
          Pythagoras.—H.P.B.] It is said also that Archimedes, in a work
          entitled <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Psammites</span></span>, inculcated the
          heliocentric theory. The sphericity of the earth was distinctly
          taught by Aristotle, who appealed for proof to the figure of the
          earth's shadow on the moon in eclipses. (Aristotle, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De
          Cælo</span></span>, lib. II., cap, XIV.) The same idea was defended
          by Pliny. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nat. Hist.</span></span>, II., 65.) These

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Several inimical critics are anxious
          to prove that no Seven Principles of Man, or Septenary Constitution
          of our Chain, were taught in our earlier volumes, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Isis
          Unveiled</span></span>. Though in that work the doctrine could only
          be hinted at, there are many passages, nevertheless, in which the
          Septenary Constitution of both Man and the Chain is openly
          mentioned. Speaking of the Elohim (II. 420), it is said:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“They remain over the seventh heaven (or
          spiritual world), for it is they who, according to the Kabalists,
          formed in succession the six material worlds, or rather, attempts
          at worlds, that preceded our own, which, they say, is the
          seventh.”</span> Our Globe, in the diagram representing the Chain,
          is, of course, the seventh and lowest; though, as the evolution on
          these Globes is cyclic, it is the fourth, on the descending arc of
          matter. And again (II. 367) it is written: <span class="tei tei-q">“In the Egyptian notions, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">as in those of all
          other faiths founded on philosophy</span></span>, man was not
          merely ... a union of soul and body; he was a trinity, when spirit
          was added to it. Besides, that doctrine made him consist of ...
          body, ... astral form, or shadow, ... animal soul, ... the higher
          soul, and ... terrestrial intelligence ... [and] a sixth principle,
          etc., etc.”</span>—the seventh—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>.
          So clearly are these principles mentioned, that even in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Index</span></span> (II. 683), one finds
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Six Principles of Man,”</span> the seventh
          being, in strict truth, the synthesis of the six, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> a
          principle but a ray of the Absolute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">All</span></span>.</dd>

          by heart, but very useful to remind our Orientalists and those

          seven Prakritis, or the seven zones of Brahmâ's Egg, the two
          accounts differ totally. In Vol. i. p. 40, the Egg is said to be
          externally invested by seven envelopes. Wilson comments:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“by Water, Air, Fire, Ether, and
          Ahamkâra”</span>—which last word does not exist in the Sanskrit
          texts. And in Vol. v. p. 198, of the same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Purâna</span></span>,
          it is written: <span class="tei tei-q">“in this manner were the
          seven forms of nature (Prakriti) reckoned from Mahat to
          Earth”</span> (?). Between Mahat, or Mahâ-Buddhi, and <span class="tei tei-q">“Water, etc.”</span>, the difference is very

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Orphic Theogony is purely Oriental and
          Indian in its spirit. The successive transformations it has
          undergone, have now separated it widely from the spirit of ancient
          Cosmogony, as may be seen by comparing it even with Hesiod's
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Theogony</span></span>. Yet the truly Âryan
          Hindû spirit breaks forth everywhere in both the Hesiodic and
          Orphic systems. (See the remarkable work of James Darmesteter,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Cosmogonies Âryennes,”</span> in his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Essais
          Orientaux</span></span>.) Thus the original Greek conception of
          Chaos is that of the Secret Wisdom Religion. In Hesiod, therefore,
          Chaos is infinite, boundless, endless and beginningless in
          duration, an abstraction and a visible presence at the same time,
          Space filled with darkness, which is primordial matter in its
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pre-cosmic</span></em> state. For in its
          etymological sense, Chaos is Space, according to Aristotle, and
          Space is the ever Unseen and Unknowable Deity, in our
          philosophy.</dd>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">There is a curious piece of
          information in the Buddhist esoteric traditions. The exoteric or
          allegorical biography of Gautama Buddha shows this great Sage dying
          of an indigestion of <span class="tei tei-q">“pork and
          rice”</span>; a very prosaic end, indeed, with little of the solemn
          element in it! This is explained as an allegorical reference to his
          having been born in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Boar”</span> or
          Varâha Kalpa, when Vishnu assumed the form of that animal to raise
          the Earth out of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Waters of
          Space.”</span> Now as the Brâhmans descend direct from Brahmâ and
          are, so to speak, identified with him; and as they are at the same
          time the mortal enemies of Buddha and Buddhism, we have this
          curious allegorical hint and combination. The Brâhmanism of the
          Boar or Varâha Kalpa has slaughtered the religion of Buddha in
          India, swept it from its face. Therefore Buddha, who is identified
          with his philosophy, is said to have died from the effects of
          eating of the flesh of a wild hog. The very idea of one who
          established the most rigorous vegetarianism and respect for animal
          life—even to refusing to eat eggs as being vehicles of latent
          life—dying of an indigestion of meat, is absurdly contradictory and
          has puzzled more than one Orientalist. But the present explanation,
          however, unveils the allegory, and makes clear all the rest. The
          Varâha, however, is no simple Boar, but seems to have meant at
          first some antediluvian lacustrine animal <span class="tei tei-q">“delighting to sport in water.”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vâyu

          The duration of the War shows its significance, and also shows that

          Buddha and the Daityas, as in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vishnu

          taught in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Esoteric Buddhism</span></span>—the gradual

          the Third Root-Race, which was first nearly destroyed by
          combustion, and then submerged. As the Commentary teaches:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The First Earth having been purified by the
          Forty-nine Fires, her people, born of Fire and Water, could not die

          vanishes in the air ...; the Third Earth had everything consumed on
          it after the Separation, and went down into the lower Deep [the
          Ocean]. This was twice eighty-two Cyclic Years
          ago.</span></span>”</span> Now a Cyclic Year is what we call a
          Sidereal Year, and is founded on the Precession of the Equinoxes.
          The length of this Sidereal Year is 25,868 years, and the period
          mentioned in the Commentary is, therefore, in all equal to
          4,242,352 years. More details will be found in Volume II.

          edifices; Thou art One, and in the secret of Thy unity the wisest
          of men are lost, because they know it not. Thou art One, and Thy

          to thy existence, nor determine for thee the Where, the How, and
          the Why. Thou art Existent, but in thyself alone, there being none
          other that can exist with thee. Thou art Existent, before all time
          and without place. Thou art Existent, and thy existence is so
          profound and secret that none can penetrate and discover thy
          secrecy. Thou art living, but within no time that can be fixed or

          The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Original Sanscrit Texts</span></span> are

          Science about one of the commonest facts of Nature—the heat of the
          Sun. He says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The question of the
          temperature of the sun has been the subject of investigation with
          many scientists: Newton, one of the first investigators of this
          problem, tried to determine it, and after him all the scientists
          who have been occupied with calorimetry have followed his example.
          All have believed themselves successful, and have formulated their
          results with great confidence. The following, in the chronological
          order of the publication of the results, are the temperatures (in
          centigrade degrees) found by each of them: Newton, 1,699,300°;
          Pouillet, 1,461°; Tollner, 102,200°; Secchi, 5,344,840°; Ericsson,
          2,726,700°; Fizeau, 7,500°; Waterston, 9,000,000°; Spoëren,
          27,000°; Deville, 9,500°; Soret, 5,801,846°; Vicaire, 1,500°;
          Rosetti, 20,000°. The difference is as 1,400° against 9,000,000°,
          or no less than 8,998,600°!! There probably does not exist in
          science a more astonishing contradiction than that revealed in
          these figures.”</span> And yet without doubt if an Occultist were

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Stallo's above-cited work,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Concepts
          of Modern Physics</span></span>, a volume which has called forth
          the liveliest protests and criticisms, is recommended to anyone
          inclined to doubt this statement. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          professed antagonism of science to metaphysical
          speculation,”</span> he writes, <span class="tei tei-q">“has led
          the majority of scientific specialists to assume that the methods
          and results of empirical research are wholly independent of the
          control of the laws of thought. They either silently ignore, or
          openly repudiate, the simplest canons of logic, including the laws
          of non-contradiction, and ... resent with the utmost vehemence
          every application of the rule of consistency to their hypotheses
          and theories ... and they regard an examination (of them) ... in
          the light of these laws as an impertinent intrusion of <span class="tei tei-q">‘<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">à priori</span></span> principles and
          methods’</span> into the domains of empirical science. Persons of
          this cast of mind find no difficulty in holding that atoms are
          absolutely inert, and at the same time asserting that these atoms
          are perfectly elastic; or in maintaining that the physical
          universe, in its last analysis, resolves itself into <span class="tei tei-q">‘dead’</span> matter and motion, and yet denying that
          all physical energy is in reality kinetic; or in proclaiming that
          all phenomenal differences in the objective world are ultimately
          due to the various motions of absolutely simple material units,
          and, nevertheless, repudiating the proposition that these units are
          equal.”</span> (p. xix.) The blindness of eminent Physicists to
          some of the most obvious consequences of their own theories is
          marvellous. <span class="tei tei-q">“When Prof. Tait, in
          conjunction with Prof. Stewart, announces that <span class="tei tei-q">‘matter is simply passive’</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Unseen
          Universe</span></span>, sec. 104), and then, in connection with Sir
          William Thomson, declares that <span class="tei tei-q">‘matter has
          an innate power of resisting external influences’</span>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Treat.
          on Nat. Phil.</span></span>, Vol. I. sec. 216), it is hardly
          impertinent to inquire how these statements are to be reconciled.
          When Prof. Du Bois Reymond ... insists upon the necessity of
          reducing all the processes of nature to motions of a substantial,
          indifferent substratum, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholly destitute of quality</span></em>
          (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ueber
          die Grenzen des Naturerkennens</span></span>, p. 5), having
          declared shortly before in the same lecture that <span class="tei tei-q">‘resolution of all changes in the material world into
          motions of atoms <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">caused by their constant central
          forces</span></em> would be the completion of natural
          science,’</span> we are in a perplexity from which we have the
          right to be relieved.”</span> (Pref. xliii.)</dd>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">If we are taken to task for believing
          in operating Gods and Spirits while rejecting a personal God, we
          answer to the Theists and Monotheists: Admit that your Jehovah is
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one of
          the Elohim</span></em>, and we are ready to recognize him. Make of
          him, as you do, the Infinite, the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">One</span></span> and the Eternal God,
          and we will never accept him in this character. Of tribal Gods
          there were many; the One Universal Deity is a principle, an
          abstract Root-Idea, which has nought to do with the unclean work of
          finite Form. We do not worship the Gods, we only honour Them, as
          beings superior to ourselves. In this we obey the Mosaic
          injunction, while Christians disobey their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bible</span></span>—missionaries foremost of
          all. <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt not revile the
          Gods,”</span> says one of them—Jehovah—in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Exodus</span></span>,
          xxii. 28; but at the same time in verse 20 it is commanded:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“He that sacrificeth to any God, save unto
          the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed.”</span> Now in the
          original texts it is not <span class="tei tei-q">“God”</span> but
          Elohim—and we challenge contradiction—and Jehovah is one of the
          Elohim, as proved by his own words in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Genesis</span></span>, iii. 22, when
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord God said: Behold the Man is
          become as one of us.”</span> Hence both those who worship and
          sacrifice to the Elohim, the Angels, and to Jehovah, and those who
          revile the Gods of their fellowmen, are far greater transgressors
          than the Occultists or than any Theosophist. Meanwhile many of the
          latter prefer believing in some one <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord”</span> or other, and are quite welcome to do as

          septenary. Âkâsha is Aditi in the allegory, and the mother of
          Mârttânda, the Sun, the Devamâtri, Mother of the Gods. In the Solar

          Psychology and Idealism, and its natural face of a Roman Augur,
          swelling his cheek with his tongue, to Materialism. Such Monists
          are worse than Materialists; because, while looking at the Universe
          and at psycho-spiritual man from the same negative stand-point, the
          latter put their case far less plausibly than do sceptics of Mr.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In a recent
            work on Symbolism in Buddhism and Christianity—in Buddhism and
            Roman Catholicism, rather, many later rituals and dogmas in
            Northern Buddhism, in its popular exoteric form, being identical
            with those of the Latin Church—some curious facts are to be
            found. The author of this volume, with more pretensions than
            erudition, has indiscriminately crammed into his work ancient and
            modern Buddhist teachings, and has sorely confused Lamaïsm with
            Buddhism. On page 404 of this volume, called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Buddhism in
            Christendom, or Jesus the Essene</span></span>, our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">pseudo</span></em>-Orientalist devotes

            <span class="tei tei-q">“the seven great legions of dead men made
            wise.”</span> Now, these Vidyâdharas, whom some Orientalists call
            <span class="tei tei-q">“demi-gods,”</span> are in fact,
            exoterically, a kind of Siddhas, <span class="tei tei-q">“affluent in devotion,”</span> and, esoterically,
            they are identical with the seven classes of Pitris, one class of
            which endow man in the Third Race with Self-consciousness, by
            incarnating in the human shells. The <span class="tei tei-q">“Hymn to the Sun,”</span> at the end of his queer
            volume of mosaic, which endows Buddhism with a Personal God (!!),
            is an unfortunate thrust at the very proofs so elaborately
            collected by the unlucky author.</p>

          understood on the hypothesis of the homogeneity of the elements of

          in what is shown by the spectrum, that modern <span class="tei tei-q">“eye of Shiva”</span> of physical experiments. It is
          only of this Matter, that H. St. Claire Deville could say that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“when bodies, deemed to be simple, combine
          with one another, they vanish, they are individually
          annihilated”</span>; simply because he could not follow those
          bodies in their further transformation in the world of spiritual
          cosmic Matter. Verily Modern Science will never be able to dig deep
          enough into the cosmological formations to find the Roots of the
          World-Stuff or Matter, unless she works on the same lines of
          thought as the mediæval Alchemist did.</dd>

          these mystics, by following what they were taught by some
          treatises, secretly preserved from one generation to another,
          achieved discoveries which would not be despised even in our modern
          days of exact sciences. Roger Bacon, the friar, was laughed at as a
          quack, and is now generally numbered among <span class="tei tei-q">‘pretenders’</span> to magic art; but his discoveries
          were nevertheless accepted, and are now used by those who ridicule
          him the most. Roger Bacon belonged by right, if not by fact, to
          that Brotherhood which includes all those who study the Occult
          Sciences. Living in the thirteenth century, almost a contemporary,
          therefore, of Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, his
          discoveries—such as gunpowder and optical glasses, and his
          mechanical achievements—were considered by everyone as so many
          miracles. He was accused of having made a compact with the Evil

          explain an element, none satisfy the demands of the human

          is <span class="tei tei-q">‘a something to which we can add, but
          from which we can take nothing,’</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‘a body which increases in weight with every chemical

          are provisional, and may cease to-morrow to be applicable in any
          given case. They take their stand, not on any attribute of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This method of
            illustrating the periodic law in the classification of elements
            is, in the words of Mr. Crookes, proposed by Professor Emerson
            Reynolds, of Dublin University, who ... <span class="tei tei-q">“points out that in each period, the general
            properties of the elements vary from one to another, with
            approximate regularity until we reach the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh
            member</span></em>, which is in more or less striking contrast
            with the first element of the same period, as well as with the
            first of the next. Thus chlorine, the seventh member of
            Mendeleef's third period, contrasts sharply with both sodium, the
            first member of the same series, and with potassium, the first
            member of the next series; whilst on the other hand, sodium and
            potassium are closely analogous. The six elements, whose atomic
            weights intervene between sodium and potassium, vary in
            properties, step by step, until chlorine, the contrast to sodium,
            is reached. But from chlorine to potassium, the analogue of
            sodium, there is a change in properties <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per
            saltum</span></span>..... If we thus recognize a contrast in
            properties—more or less decided—between the first and the last
            members of each series, we can scarcely help admitting the
            existence of a point of mean variation within each system. In
            general the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth</span></em> element of each series
            possesses the property we might expect a transition-element to
            exhibit.... Thus for the purpose of graphic translation,
            Professor Reynolds considers that the fourth member of a
            period—silicon, for example—may be placed at the apex of a
            symmetrical curve, which shall represent for that particular
            period, the direction in which the properties of the series of
            elements vary with rising atomic weights.”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, the
            writer humbly confesses complete ignorance of modern Chemistry
            and its mysteries. But she is pretty well acquainted with the
            Occult Doctrine with regard to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">correspondences
            of types and antetypes</span></em> in nature, and to perfect
            analogy as a fundamental law in Occultism. Hence she ventures on
            a remark which will strike every Occultist, however it may be
            derided by orthodox Science. This method of illustrating the
            periodic law in the behaviour of elements, whether or not still a
            hypothesis in Chemistry, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is a law in Occult Sciences</span></em>.
            Every well-read Occultist knows that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth</span></em> members—whether in a
            septenary chain of worlds, the septenary hierarchy of angels, or
            in the constitution of man, animal, plant, or mineral atom—that
            the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fourth</span></em> members, we say, in the
            geometrically and mathematically uniform workings of the
            immutable laws of Nature, always play a distinct and specific
            part in the septenary system. From the stars twinkling high in
            heaven, to the sparks flying asunder from the rude fire built by
            the savage in his forest; from the hierarchies and the essential
            constitution of the Dhyân Chohans—organized for diviner
            apprehensions and a loftier range of perception than the greatest
            Western Psychologist ever dreamed of, down to Nature's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">classification</span></em> of species among
            the humblest insects; finally from Worlds to Atoms, everything in
            the Universe, from great to small, proceeds in its spiritual and
            physical evolution, cyclically and septennially, showing its
            seventh and fourth number (the latter the turning point) behaving
            in the same way as is shown in that periodic law of Atoms. Nature
            never proceeds <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">per saltum</span></span>. Therefore, when
            Mr. Crookes remarks on this that he does not <span class="tei tei-q">“wish to infer that the gaps in Mendeleef's table,
            and in this graphic representation of it [the diagram showing the
            evolution of Atoms] necessarily mean that there are elements
            actually existing to fill up the gaps; these gaps may only mean
            that at the birth of the elements there was an easy potentiality
            of the formation of an element which would fit into the
            place”</span>—an Occultist would respectfully remark to him that
            the latter hypothesis can only hold good, if the septenary
            arrangement of Atoms is not interfered with. This is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the one
            law</span></em>, and an infallible method that must always lead
            one who follows it to success.</p>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">In the Greek and Latin Churches—which

          during the marriage ceremony represents the apex of the triangle;
          the bride, its left feminine side, and the bridegroom the right
          side, while the base line is symbolized by the row of witnesses,
          the bridesmaids and best men. But behind the priest there is the
          Holy of Holies, with its mysterious containments and symbolic
          meaning, inside of which no one but the consecrated priests should
          enter. In the early days of Christianity the marriage ceremony was
          a mystery and a true symbol. Now, however, even the Churches have
          lost the true meaning of this symbolism.</dd>

<dd class="tei tei-notetext">Leibnitz was an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absolute</span></em> Idealist in maintaining

          126, col. 2.) For him Matter was a simple representation of the
          Monad, whether human or atomic. Monads, he thought (as do we), are
          everywhere. Thus the human soul is a Monad, and every cell in the
          human body has its Monad, as has every cell in animal, vegetable,
          and even in the so-called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inorganic</span></em> bodies. His Atoms are
          the molecules of modern Science, and his Monads those <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">simple

          it will never succeed in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interviewing</span></em> them—except in
          imagination. But Leibnitz is rather contradictory in his views
          about Monads. He speaks of his <span class="tei tei-q">“Metaphysical Points”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“Formal Atoms,”</span> at one time as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">realities</span></em>, occupying space; at

            Molecularists—Huxley, Tyndall, Vogt, and Co.—and request them to
            examine whether it is true or not to say that, though the
            scientific premisses may not be always correct, they are,
            nevertheless, accepted, to fill up a gap or a hole in some
            beloved materialistic hobby. Speaking of protoplasm and the
            organs of man, as <span class="tei tei-q">“viewed by Mr.
            Huxley,”</span> the author says: <span class="tei tei-q">“Probably then, in regard to any continuity in
            protoplasm of power, of form, or of substance, we have seen
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lacunæ</span></span> enow. Nay, Mr. Huxley
            himself can be adduced in evidence on the same side. Not rarely
            do we find in his essay admissions of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">probability</span></em>, where it is
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainty</span></em> that is alone in
            place. He says, for example: <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is more
            than probable that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em> the vegetable world is
            thoroughly explored we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">shall</span></em> find all plants in
            possession of the same powers.’</span> When a conclusion is
            decidedly announced, it is rather disappointing to be told, as
            here, that the premisses are still to collect [!!].... Again,
            here is a passage in which he is seen to cut his own <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">basis</span></em>’</span> from beneath his
            own feet. After telling us that all forms of protoplasm consist
            of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen <span class="tei tei-q">‘in very complex union,’</span> he continues:
            <span class="tei tei-q">‘To this complex combination, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the nature of
            which has never been determined with exactness</span></em> [!!],
            the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">protein</span></em> has been
            applied.’</span> This, plainly, is an identification, on Mr.
            Huxley's own part, of protoplasm and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">protein</span></em>; and what is said of
            one, being necessarily true of the other, it follows that he
            admits the nature of protoplasm never to have been determined
            with exactness, and that even in his eyes the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lis</span></span> is still <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">sub

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every scholar
            is aware, of course, that the Chaldeans claimed the same digits
            (432), or 432,000, for their Divine Dynasties as the Hindûs do
            for their Mahâyuga, namely 4,320,000. Therefore has Dr. Sepp, of
            Munich, undertaken to support Kepler and Wilford in their charge
            that the Hindûs borrowed them from the Christians, and the
            Chaldeans from the Jews, who, it is claimed, expected their
            Messiah in the lunar year of the world 4,320!!! As these figures,
            according to ancient writers, were based by Berosus on the 120
            Saroses—each of the divisions meaning six Neroses of 600 years
            each, making a sum total of 432,000 years—they would appear to be
            peremptory, remarks De Mirville (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Des
            Esprits</span></span>, iii. p. 24). So the pious professor of
            Munich undertook to explain them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the correct
            way</span></em>. He claims to have solved the riddle by showing
            that <span class="tei tei-q">“the saros being composed, according
            to Pliny, of 222 synodial months, to wit, 18 years 6/10,”</span>
            the calculator naturally fell back on the figures <span class="tei tei-q">“given by Suidas,”</span> who affirmed that the
            <span class="tei tei-q">“120 saroses made 2,222 sacerdotal and
            cyclic years, which equalled 1,656 solar years.”</span>
            (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vie de
            Notre Seigneur Jésus Christ</span></span>, ii. p. 417.)</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Suidas
            said nothing of the kind; and, even supposing he had, he would
            prove little, if anything, by such a statement. The Neroses and
            Saroses were the same thorn in the side of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">uninitiated</span></em> ancient writers as
            the apocalyptic 666 of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Great
            Beast”</span> is in that of the modern, and the former figures
            have found their unlucky Newtons, as have the latter.</p>

          the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“climacteric year”</span> has
          more than the usual significance, when used by Occultists and
          Mystics. It is not only a critical period, during which some great
          change is periodically expected, whether in human or cosmic
          constitution, but it likewise pertains to universal spiritual
          changes. The Europeans called every 63rd year the <span class="tei tei-q">“grand climacteric,”</span> and perhaps justly supposed
          those years to be the years produced by multiplying 7 into the odd
          numbers 3, 5, 7 and 9. But 7 is the real scale of Nature, in
          Occultism, and 7 has to be multiplied in quite a different way and
          method than is as yet known to European nations.</dd>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div><div class="secthead">

</div><div class="secthead">
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
